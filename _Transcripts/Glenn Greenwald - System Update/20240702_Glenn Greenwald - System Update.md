# SCOTUS Recap: Excessive January 6 Prosecutions Overturned
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [July 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI)
*  So it has been a really big week for the Supreme Court and we think it's very [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=0.0s)]
*  important to cover the Supreme Court not just to explain what the outcome is so [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=10.72s)]
*  that people who are on the left or right judge the outcome simply based on the [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=15.44s)]
*  results but to really give you an understanding of what this very powerful [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  entity in the United States is doing. We covered one decision that they issued [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=21.96s)]
*  earlier this week which is the decision where they shielded the Biden [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=27.64s)]
*  administration from any sort of constitutional review and in that [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=32.64s)]
*  decision Amy Coney Barrett and John Roberts joined with the three liberals. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  It was Alito and Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas in the minority. It was [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=45.92s)]
*  Brett Kavanaugh, Amy Coney Barrett and John Roberts who joined the three [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=54.12s)]
*  liberals for a six to three ruling that said the plaintiffs don't have standing [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=58.36s)]
*  there. We covered that in depth the other night. Also today they overturned the [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=61.599999999999994s)]
*  court did by six to three ruling with the six conservatives on one side. The [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=65.92s)]
*  long-standing doctrine called the chevron doctrine which basically though [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=71.12s)]
*  it sounds boring instructs courts to defer to the interpretations of [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=74.96s)]
*  congressional law whatever agencies decide the law means and the court has [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=81.24s)]
*  said there's no reason for judges to give deference to say the EPA or the FBI [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=87.47999999999999s)]
*  or any other executive branch agency there to regulate. It's not their job to [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=95.32s)]
*  interpret what Congress meant it's Congress's job to pass a clear law and [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=100.19999999999999s)]
*  if they don't if there's ambiguity then the courts are the place where those [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=104.44s)]
*  disputes should be determined. It really has the effect of taking a lot of power [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=109.0s)]
*  away from the administrative state the unelected administrative state and [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=112.48s)]
*  handing it back to Congress and to some extent to the courts. On July 1st on [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=116.28s)]
*  Monday the court will decide its last case which is whether or not President [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=122.52s)]
*  Trump enjoys immunity from any kind of prosecution for acts undertaken as [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=127.03999999999999s)]
*  president that will obviously have a big impact. My guess is they will either [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=133.92000000000002s)]
*  reject his theory or we'll send it back to the courts to further analyze certain [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=138.4s)]
*  things but we'll see how that goes. But they also today overturned the theory [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=143.32s)]
*  that prosecutors had been using in order to take nonviolent January 6th [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=148.96s)]
*  protesters and even some who use violence and turn them into felons using [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=155.32s)]
*  an extremely distorted and stretched interpretation of a law that was passed [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=161.12s)]
*  back in 2000 after the Enron scandal Paul Krugman was on the board of [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=166.4s)]
*  directors of that company Enron that was turned out to be a gigantic fraud the [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=172.28s)]
*  whole thing collapsed and in the wake of the collapse of that of Enron they [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=176.6s)]
*  realized that there was a loophole in the law that prevented them from [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=182.84s)]
*  prosecuting the accountants who helped Enron commit that fraud. They prosecuted [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=185.84s)]
*  the CPA from Arthur Anderson but they couldn't prosecute the individuals and [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=192.08s)]
*  so they enacted a law called Sarbanes-Oxley after the two members of [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=196.0s)]
*  Congress who sponsored it and all that law did was say that if you obstruct [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=200.56s)]
*  investigations or official proceedings you can be guilty of a felony that had [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=207.16s)]
*  no intention for it to apply to political protest it was simply designed [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=211.76s)]
*  to prevent people from obstructing ongoing investigations. After January 6th [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=216.6s)]
*  the prosecutors who were covering this these these cases were under a lot of [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=222.4s)]
*  pressure to put these January 6th defendants including ones who committed [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=228.16s)]
*  no use no violence into prison for a long time in order to do that they needed [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=231.44s)]
*  to concoct a theory as to why just entering Congress and protesting can [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=236.04000000000002s)]
*  somehow turn you into a felon and the theory that they used was this wildly [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=242.8s)]
*  expansive interpretation of Sarbanes-Oxley that the Supreme Court [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=250.04s)]
*  today rejected which means that a lot of those prosecutions of January 6th [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=253.95999999999998s)]
*  defendants can be in jeopardy and the case that Jack Smith has brought against [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=259.44s)]
*  Donald Trump charging him with felonies related to his conduct pertaining to [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=263.88s)]
*  January 6th also in part use this theory that the Supreme Court today rejected. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=268.03999999999996s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal back in 20 of 21 explained the following quote to [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=274.0s)]
*  prosecute January 6th Capitol rioters the government tests a novel legal [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=282.03999999999996s)]
*  strategy. At first trials approach some defendants are [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=286.56s)]
*  challenging use of Sarbanes-Oxley act to obtain felony convictions and [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=291.91999999999996s)]
*  stiff sentences. The problem was these judges were too cowardly too afraid to [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=296.88s)]
*  rule in favor of January 6th defendant so almost every judge in the lower court [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=306.0s)]
*  level accepted and approved the prosecutors distortion of the law and [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=309.96s)]
*  I've been writing about this going back for many years here in is an article I [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=315.4s)]
*  wrote in Substack in 2021 where I was describing how Democrats had always [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=320.65999999999997s)]
*  pretended to be so pro-defendant anti-prosecutor believe in criminal [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=325.76s)]
*  justice reform and yet when it comes to their political enemies they're willing [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=329.8s)]
*  to relinquish every one of the claimed beliefs they have about the judicial [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=333.68s)]
*  system in order to ensure that their political enemies go into prison. I [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=338.32s)]
*  talked a lot about how the prosecutor Michael Flynn which almost every left [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=342.21999999999997s)]
*  liberal cheered use a huge number of prosecutorial weapons and theories that [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=346.52s)]
*  anyone who considered them a criminal justice reform advocate had long opposed [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=353.92s)]
*  and of course they didn't care they suddenly embraced it in order to put [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=357.92s)]
*  Michael Flynn in prison. The same thing happened when cheering the conviction as [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=361.84000000000003s)]
*  felons of January 6th defendants under a theory of law that was obviously so [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=367.72s)]
*  distorted so stretched and dubious Ian that had the potential in the future of [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=371.98s)]
*  turning any political protesters into felons simply because they might have [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=378.22s)]
*  disrupted a proceeding in Congress and here's what I said in that article when [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=382.92s)]
*  describing specifically what the prosecutors were doing here quote the [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=388.96000000000004s)]
*  most protracted thirst for harsh criminal punishment from Democrats has [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=396.54s)]
*  been directed at those who participated in the protest-turned riot at the [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=400.08000000000004s)]
*  Capitol on January 6th of the more than 600 people charged with crimes in [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=404.52000000000004s)]
*  connection with that riot only a minority are accused of using violence [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=409.32s)]
*  of any kind in other words the majority of January 6th defendants are accused of [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=413.76s)]
*  nonviolent crimes while few people object to prison terms for people who [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=418.04s)]
*  use violence as part of that riot even though many progressives do object to [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=423.28s)]
*  long prison terms for those who use violence as part of the 2020 black lives [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=428.44s)]
*  protest movement a large number of nonviolent protesters face serious [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=432.24s)]
*  felony charges and lengthy prison terms that nonviolent protesters should not be [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=436.84s)]
*  in prison is foundational the criminal justice reform movement yet it is nowhere [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=442.15999999999997s)]
*  to be found when it comes to the January 6th defendants who real crime whose real [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=446.76s)]
*  crime is that they have the wrong ideology to charge nonviolent January 6th [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=450.47999999999996s)]
*  defendants with felony charges has been a serious prosecutor a challenge for [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=456.47999999999996s)]
*  federal prosecutors since when is nonviolent trespassing a felony to [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=461.28s)]
*  convert it into one the DOJ has invented a warp theory about what the [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=466.91999999999996s)]
*  Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 was intended to criminalize insisting that the phrase [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=472.4s)]
*  obstruction of justice provision of that law intended to regulate Wall Street [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=478.55999999999995s)]
*  somehow applies to the January 6 certification vote at the Capitol and [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=483.35999999999996s)]
*  the irony was in order to argue that they had to depict the vote counting on [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=489.68s)]
*  January 6 not as a mere ministerial act but as an official investigation that [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=494.44s)]
*  Congress is undertaking where they had the option to reject the vote totals or [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=499.47999999999996s)]
*  accept them the exact theory that Donald Trump had used as to why Mike Pence [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=504.15999999999997s)]
*  could reject the totals so it was always an extremely warped in stretch meaning [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=508.84s)]
*  we covered it as well earlier this year because an appellate court had finally [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=518.3199999999999s)]
*  looked at all these prosecutions and rejected the validity of this theory [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=522.48s)]
*  that the prosecutors had used to put a lot of January 6th defendants into [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=528.9599999999999s)]
*  prison as felons and here's part of what we reported back then in March because [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=533.04s)]
*  they weren't engaged in violence and typically nonviolent political [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=537.92s)]
*  protesters in the US are rarely charged and if they are they're charged with [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=541.3199999999999s)]
*  misdemeanors but not in the January 6th case and the way that this was done is [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=544.52s)]
*  so ironic we've been over this before I've written articles about it you can [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=550.36s)]
*  go and if you want to really dig into the legal the legalities of what I'm [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=553.88s)]
*  describing here you can do so but basically there were laws that were [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=559.36s)]
*  enacted in the wake of the collapse of Enron which was a gigantic energy [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=563.4399999999999s)]
*  company Paul Krugman so we don't need that whole explanation again I just want [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=568.8s)]
*  to show you that this is something we've been covering for a long time because I [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=572.8s)]
*  have been always very alarmed that prosecutors are just able to invent new [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=575.4s)]
*  laws out of nowhere and everybody was fine with it because all they wanted to [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=582.8s)]
*  do is put January 6th defendants or protesters into prison for a long time [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=587.84s)]
*  without the slightest regard to whether they actually committed felonies they [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=592.92s)]
*  were seen as political prisoners as people that you just wanted in prison at [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=598.12s)]
*  any cost and because judges were too afraid to rule in their favor many of [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=601.44s)]
*  them went to prison for a long time as felons under a theory that never made [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=607.0400000000001s)]
*  any sense here in March of first of this year was the first glimmer that courts [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=610.2s)]
*  were finally willing to say that this is a theory that had no validity from the [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=615.72s)]
*  Washington Post quote appeals court ruling means that over a hundred [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=621.8800000000001s)]
*  January 6th rioters may be resentenced and then it goes on to explain what the [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=626.2s)]
*  court ruled now it was this ruling that went to the Supreme Court and the [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=632.6s)]
*  Supreme Court decided today by a six to three ruling that you cannot turn [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=637.44s)]
*  January 6th defendants and protesters into felons under this interpretation of [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=646.44s)]
*  the Sarbanes-Oxley Act that had been used over and over to throw these people in [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=653.04s)]
*  prison for a long time and the breakdown of the decision was very interesting the [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=657.4799999999999s)]
*  six justices voting to reject the prosecution theory were five [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=663.68s)]
*  conservatives Thomas Alito Gorsuch Kavanaugh and Roberts along with [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=669.8s)]
*  Katanji Brown Jackson who joined the majority and she did so and then wrote a [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=678.04s)]
*  concurrent opinion her own opinion that was extraordinary in terms of just how [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=683.72s)]
*  straightforward it was in condemning what had been done to these defendants [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=689.92s)]

*  values and judicial beliefs simply because she doesn't like the ideology of [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=699.92s)]
*  the defendant she very commendably applied her pro defendant anti [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=705.48s)]
*  prosecutor ideology to these defendants as well because she knew that allowing [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=710.6s)]
*  prosecutors to invent laws to put people in prison who don't belong there will [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=716.44s)]
*  endanger everybody on the other hand the three justices who formed the dissent [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=720.72s)]
*  were Elena Kagan Sonia Sotomayor and Amy Coney Barrett and she wrote Amy Coney [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=727.72s)]
*  Barrett the dissenting opinion but in reality she wasn't ruling against the [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=734.8s)]
*  January 6th defendant she is a pro prosecutor judge and so her ruling as [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=741.3599999999999s)]
*  well was consistent with her long-standing theory about how to [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=746.28s)]
*  interpret laws especially criminal laws that are generally unfavorable to [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=749.8399999999999s)]
*  defendant so it was really an example where at least those who judges Jackson [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=754.3199999999999s)]
*  and Barrett reached a conclusion legally that they knew would displease [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=758.28s)]
*  their political faction and I think when a judge does that even if you don't like [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=764.68s)]
*  the result that it creates that's actually commendable that's what you [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=769.64s)]
*  want from a judge that's what every judge swears when they're being confirmed [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=774.8s)]
*  before the Senate that they'll do well we're just going to apply the law without [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=779.0s)]
*  the slightest regard for the political outcomes and very few judges do that and [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=782.8s)]
*  when judges do it as they both did here I think it's to be celebrated let me [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=787.96s)]
*  just give you a slight taste of why the court ruled the way it did and reality [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=791.44s)]
*  it's a very technical ruling it's just a question of how to interpret this law [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=797.72s)]
*  and whether it should be read expansively to include behaviors like [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=801.12s)]
*  protesting the Congress on January 6th and the majority said that it [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=807.96s)]
*  Here's what the majority opinion from Justice Roberts said quote to prove a [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=813.84s)]
*  violation of section 1512 C2 that's the provision of the Star Baines-Oxley Act [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=823.32s)]
*  the government must establish that the defendant impaired the availability or [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=829.64s)]
*  integrity for use in an official proceeding of records documents objects [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=834.0s)]
*  or as we earlier explained other things used in the proceeding or attempted to [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=838.84s)]
*  do so the judgment of the DC Circuit is therefore vacated and the case is [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=843.0s)]
*  remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion on remand [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=848.2s)]
*  the DC Court may assess the sufficiency of all these other charges so it was a [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=852.4s)]
*  very just straightforward statutory interpretation where they concluded that [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=857.36s)]
*  Star Baines-Oxley could not be read to turn these people into felons the much [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=863.04s)]
*  more interesting opinion was what Justice Conj. Brown Jackson wrote in her [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=867.84s)]
*  occurrence where she explains why she's joining the majority the conservative [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=873.8000000000001s)]
*  majority in enrolling in favor of the January 6th defendants listen to what [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=878.96s)]
*  she said here I think this is such an important passage and I wish every [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=883.52s)]
*  liberal who respects and likes her would actually read this to understand what it [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=888.0400000000001s)]
*  means to apply a principle irrespective of the political outcome or the ideology [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=892.4s)]
*  the people whose legal rights you're protecting this is what she wrote quote [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=898.72s)]
*  on January 6 2021 an angry mob stormed the US Capitol seeking to prevent [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=903.04s)]
*  Congress from fulfilling its constitutional duty to certify the [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=908.8s)]
*  electoral votes in the 2020 election the peaceful transfer of power is a [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=912.52s)]
*  fundamental democratic norm and those who attempted to disrupt it in this way [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=917.24s)]
*  inflicted a deep wound on this nation so she's saying like I see January 6 the [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=921.0s)]
*  way liberals see it but then she goes on but today's case is not about the [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=926.16s)]
*  immorality of those acts instead the question before this court is far [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=931.88s)]
*  narrower what is the scope of the particular crime Congress has outlined [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=936.56s)]
*  in the 18 USC 1512 C2 that's the law we've been talking about and then she [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=941.84s)]
*  went on to say this quote in the United States of America and she's quoting a [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=947.8399999999999s)]
*  case here quote men are not subjected to criminal punishment because their [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=952.12s)]
*  conduct offends our patriotic emotions or thwarts a general purpose sought to [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=956.9599999999999s)]
*  be affected by specific commands which they have not obeyed nor are they to be [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=963.0799999999999s)]
*  held guilty of offenses which the statues have omitted though by [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=969.2199999999999s)]
*  an advertence to define and condemn and she quotes a 1943 Supreme Court case [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=974.72s)]
*  there and then she goes on our commitment to equal justice and the [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=978.5600000000001s)]
*  rule of law requires the court to faithfully apply criminal laws as [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=982.32s)]
*  written even in periods of national crises and even when the conduct alleged [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=986.98s)]
*  is indisputably abhorrent notwithstanding the shock of circumstances [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=993.32s)]
*  involved in this case or the government's determination that they [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=999.48s)]
*  warrant prosecution today this court's task is to determine what conduct is [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=1002.28s)]
*  prescribed by the criminal statute that has been invoked as the basis for the [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=1007.24s)]
*  obstruction charge at issue here I joined in the court's opinion because I [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=1011.6s)]
*  agree with the majority that this law does not reach all forms of obstructive [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=1015.68s)]
*  conduct and is instead limited by the preceding list of criminal violations [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=1019.88s)]
*  and as a result she voted to apply this law in a much narrower way than the [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=1024.44s)]
*  prosecutors of January 6th defendants had applied it now similarly Amy Coney [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=1031.54s)]
*  Barrett who might have surprised a lot of people by voting in favor of a [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=1038.6599999999999s)]
*  prosecutorial theory used against January 6th defendants but in reality [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=1043.34s)]
*  she's a pro-defendant pro prosecutor generally judge who often rules against [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=1046.54s)]
*  defendants she did what you would expect her to do if she were ruling [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=1053.02s)]
*  apolitically which is she just like Katanji Brown Jackson gave a anti [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=1056.34s)]
*  prosecutor ruling Judge Barrett gave a pro prosecutor ruling and this is what [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=1062.3s)]
*  she wrote it's a very technical and legal analysis and that's it quote this [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=1067.78s)]
*  court does not dispute that Congress's joint session qualifies as in its [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=1071.5s)]
*  official proceeding that rioters delayed the proceeding or even that the [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=1075.24s)]
*  defendant's conduct alleged conduct which includes trespassing and a [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=1079.9199999999998s)]
*  physical confrontation with law enforcement was part of a successful [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=1083.76s)]
*  effort to forcibly halt the certification of the election results [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=1087.0s)]
*  given these premises the case that this defendant can be tried for quote [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=1090.66s)]
*  obstructing influencer impeding an official proceeding seems open and shut [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=1095.08s)]
*  so why does the court hold otherwise because it simply cannot believe that [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=1099.74s)]
*  Congress meant what it said the law in question is a very broad provision and [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=1103.56s)]
*  admittedly events like January 6 were not the top which number not its targets [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=1108.8s)]
*  who could blame Congress for that failure of imagination but statues often [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=1113.4199999999998s)]
*  go further than the problem that inspired them and under the rules of [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=1118.4199999999998s)]
*  statutory interpretation we stick to the text anyway so I think the ruling is [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=1121.22s)]
*  absolutely right I've been arguing this for many years from the beginning that [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=1128.78s)]
*  this law provides no basis for prosecuting January 6 defendants as [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=1133.26s)]
*  felons I am very glad the Supreme Court concluded that way that means a lot of [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=1139.24s)]
*  January 6 felons are gonna have their convictions subject to being overturned [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=1145.32s)]
*  or reviewed it's gonna make the prosecution of Donald Trump much more [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=1150.0s)]
*  difficult since this is a theory that Jack Smith used that the Supreme Court [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=1153.56s)]
*  is now said is invalid but I also want to emphasize that although we generally [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=1157.76s)]
*  celebrate when judges reach a outcome that we want sometimes judges are are [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=1164.06s)]
*  willing to contravene an outcome that they may be politically sympathetic to [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=1172.3s)]
*  because their legal reasoning leads them to that conclusion and that's what we [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=1178.54s)]
*  should want in judges after we should celebrate in judges so I think Amy [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=1183.62s)]
*  Coney Barrett is wrong here but I think it's impressive that she's willing to [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=1187.7s)]
*  apply the way she interprets criminal law to reach the conclusion that she [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=1192.68s)]
*  reached even though she's ruling against January 6 defendants and conversely I [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=1196.88s)]
*  think what Katadi Brown Jackson did in applying her long-standing interpretation [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=1201.1200000000001s)]
*  of the criminal law to favor defendants and limit prosecutorial power even [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=1207.6200000000001s)]
*  though in this case it ended up protecting January 6 defendants which she [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=1214.64s)]
*  made very clear are people she finds to have engaged in horrific and dangerous [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=1217.96s)]
*  behavior I think that too is extremely commendable that is what we want from [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=1223.0400000000002s)]
*  judges even in the cases where we end up disagreeing with them so finally I think [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=1227.24s)]
*  it's so important that the courts have been willing three years later to set [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=1231.96s)]
*  aside all the intense emotion around January 6 to abandon this idea that we [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=1237.8200000000002s)]
*  should invent laws or fabricate laws or concoct new and exotic theories to [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=1243.64s)]
*  justify putting people into prison because we don't like the politics or [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=1249.5200000000002s)]
*  the political protest in which they engaged and every time the court [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=1252.8000000000002s)]
*  engages in an act where they're just actually interpreting and applying the [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=1257.1200000000001s)]
*  law and not doing so because of the political outcomes I think it's [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3QxkLNXyI&t=1260.0800000000002s)]
