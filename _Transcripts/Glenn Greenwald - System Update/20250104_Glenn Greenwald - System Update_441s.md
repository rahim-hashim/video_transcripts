# Meet Nico: A Miracle Dog Who Completed The Pack
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [January 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ)
*  All right, probably you are familiar by now with our segment we call System Pup Date. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=0.0s)]
*  I still don't know the origins of that term. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=11.44s)]
*  I once credited a locals member with inventing it and he himself renounced credit for it, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  saying that someone on our team actually invented it. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=21.12s)]
*  I think somebody could be Victor Puzi, who's our show's director and who's the co-host [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=24.36s)]
*  of our after show with me and he said he doesn't think he did it. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=27.68s)]
*  But any event, usually success has a thousand fathers and failure is an orphan. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=31.16s)]
*  In this case, the successful title is for some reason an orphan. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=36.88s)]
*  No one wants to claim credit for it. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=41.08s)]
*  I think it's great and the idea of it I think is even better, which is rescuing dogs is [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=42.28s)]
*  an incredibly profound thing to do, not just for the dog but for the person. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  It's something I devoted a lot of my life to doing. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  I think every rescue story is different. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=53.96s)]
*  Every dog is different and there's a lot to learn from every dog. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=55.96s)]
*  So just as kind of a way to end each week on a lighter and more positive and inspiring [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=58.6s)]
*  and optimistic note, we're going to feature one of the dogs that we rescued, either who's [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=65.4s)]
*  now at our home as in the case of Nico, the star of this segment this week, or at our [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=70.1s)]
*  shelter. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=75.44s)]
*  We have about another 150 to 200 dogs at any given time. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=76.44s)]
*  I was being a little bit mocked by my colleagues here for always saying this. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=81.84s)]
*  I think I've said it every segment, but I'm going to say it this time because I really [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=85.36s)]
*  do mean it. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=88.0s)]
*  I've meant it the other times too. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=89.0s)]
*  Maybe it's the fact that I'm enamored of all dogs. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=90.0s)]
*  I do find rescue stories so amazing, but Nico has one of the most extraordinary stories of [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=92.24s)]
*  any rescue dog we've ever done for the reasons that you're about to see. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=98.56s)]
*  So we're going to show you this that will end the show. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=101.92s)]
*  And so thank you so much for watching. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=104.75999999999999s)]
*  We hope to see you back on Monday night and every night at 7 p.m. Eastern live, exclusive [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=107.75999999999999s)]
*  I hope you have a great evening and a great weekend and enjoy this system pup date segment [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=114.12s)]
*  to end your week. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=118.36s)]
*  Today's guest starring dog. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=123.56s)]
*  His name is Nico. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=125.56s)]
*  He's not exactly a lap dog. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=126.56s)]
*  I don't think I would say that I spend a lot of time with him in my lap like this, but [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=128.4s)]
*  he seems very happy. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=132.52s)]
*  Usually he's just more running around. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=133.96s)]
*  Nico has an amazing story about 12 years ago. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=136.08s)]
*  I was a little puppy at the time. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=139.64s)]
*  My husband, David and I had six dogs, only six. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=140.64s)]
*  And I was driving up the hill near our house, which was kind of in the middle of this forest. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=145.88s)]
*  And I saw this old debilitated dog doing her best to climb up this hill and really not [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=150.72s)]
*  being able to. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=158.67999999999998s)]
*  She was constantly falling down. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=159.67999999999998s)]
*  She was clearly not well. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=160.94s)]
*  I stopped. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=162.83999999999997s)]
*  She looked like she had a very distended stomach, which is common for dogs when they're starving [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=165.01999999999998s)]
*  or hungry. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=168.72s)]
*  At the time, we thought six dogs was too much. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=169.72s)]
*  And I just, you know, have been yelled at many times if I take up if I take new dogs [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=172.20000000000002s)]
*  home. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=175.72s)]
*  So I tried to leave her there. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=176.72s)]
*  I had actually just come from the grocery store. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=177.72s)]
*  So I fed her some food that I had bought. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=178.9s)]
*  I went back home and I did everything to try and forget about her. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=181.84s)]
*  And I just couldn't. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=184.72s)]
*  So I after a half an hour went back to that spot. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=185.72s)]
*  She was barely had barely moved. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=187.70000000000002s)]
*  She really she had these like huge sores in her leg. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=189.64000000000001s)]
*  I picked her up and brought her home. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=192.44s)]
*  And things were OK at home about it. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=196.16s)]
*  I didn't get yelled at too much until that night when I brought her to the veterinarian [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=198.0s)]
*  and the veterinarian said, oh, good news that she's pregnant and she's going to give birth [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=202.12s)]
*  to six dogs in about 10 days. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=207.72s)]
*  So I took her home. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=211.88s)]
*  And basically, that meant that I had just doubled the size of our pack because we had [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=212.88s)]
*  six. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=216.36s)]
*  She was the seventh and six more. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=217.36s)]
*  It was going to be 13. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=218.36s)]
*  And then I did get in trouble domestically. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=219.36s)]
*  But you know, at the same time, David fell in love with her and she gave birth to six [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=221.48000000000002s)]
*  puppies. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=224.8s)]
*  We found homes actually in the US for four of them. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=226.0s)]
*  I did a book tour with David. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=229.12s)]
*  We brought these dogs with us, dropped them off in different cities with the families [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=230.28s)]
*  that wanted each of them. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=234.72s)]
*  So we had two left. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=235.76000000000002s)]
*  One was Luke, who just died about two months ago. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=237.36s)]
*  It was a great dog. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=241.56s)]
*  That was one of her puppies. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=242.9s)]
*  And the other was Nico. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=244.24s)]
*  And they were inseparable. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=246.46s)]
*  Nico and Luke, they were brothers. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=247.64000000000001s)]
*  They were just, you know, the two left from the pack. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=249.72s)]
*  We had Mabel, of course, too, their mother. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=253.54s)]
*  And they were always together, kind of like as a family. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=255.06s)]
*  And sadly, Nico was sick from the time that he was born. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=258.74s)]
*  He had this stomach issue, an intestinal issue where he really couldn't process food. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=262.14s)]
*  And he died at the age of one and a half years. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=266.7s)]
*  It was so sad. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=268.86s)]
*  Nico was this very gentle, loving dog. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=269.86s)]
*  And Luke lost his brother and Mabel lost her puppy. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=273.14s)]
*  And it was just we were all very sad. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=275.84s)]
*  And Nico was such a kind, compassionate dog. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=277.5s)]
*  To see him die that young was amazing, was terrible. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=280.03999999999996s)]
*  And tragic. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=283.58s)]
*  And the amazing thing that happened is about six weeks after Nico died, this dog showed [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=284.58s)]
*  up right outside the gates of our house. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=289.62s)]
*  And he was a small puppy. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=292.02s)]
*  And we, of course, let him in and fed him. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=294.3s)]
*  And then immediately, not only did he become, of all the dogs we had there, I think 10 or [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=296.38s)]
*  9 at that point, of all the dogs we had there, he picked Luke to attach himself to. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=302.22s)]
*  All of his behavior was so similar to Nico, the way that Nico would stand up on his two [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=309.02000000000004s)]
*  hind legs and kind of hug you by putting his two paws on your shoulder. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=313.86s)]
*  This dog started doing that as well. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=317.0s)]
*  And he had the same kind, gentle personality. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=318.82s)]
*  And you can say it's invented. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=321.82000000000005s)]
*  You can say it's kind of a delusion. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=324.08000000000004s)]
*  But we really felt like this dog was with the spirit of Nico. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=326.5s)]
*  They were identical in behavior, the fact that he was inseparable from Luke. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=331.46000000000004s)]
*  We've never done this before, but we named him Nico after the dog who had just died. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=335.3s)]
*  And until Luke died two months ago, he and Nico were inseparable, as if they were actually [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=340.14s)]
*  brothers, like the first Nico. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=346.42s)]
*  And he's just an incredibly loving dog. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=349.26s)]
*  He can be aggressive, like when he's defending the dogs that he's very closely friends with. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=351.78000000000003s)]
*  He's older now, so he kind of has a lot of respect in the pack. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=357.66s)]
*  But he's never aggressive where he starts fights. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=362.06s)]
*  Until just if a dog growls at a weaker dog or a dog that he likes, he will definitely [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=363.7s)]
*  defend that dog. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=368.97999999999996s)]
*  But otherwise, he's just a dog that is exactly like the puppy we found, full of love, very [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=370.74s)]
*  spiritually connected, very peaceful, very tranquil. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=375.09999999999997s)]
*  And it's very sad that Luke died because that was really his brother, even though not biologically, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=379.58s)]
*  but spiritually for sure. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=384.74s)]
*  So we've been keeping an eye on him, kind of giving him a lot of attention ever since [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=386.3s)]
*  Luke died because he's obviously sad and misses the dog that he was closest to. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=389.06s)]
*  But he continues to be just a very happy, fun, playful dog, and he's had an amazing [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=393.62s)]
*  life and he's still healthy, even though he's getting up there in years. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=398.98s)]
*  And it was really one of the most amazing rescue stories we've had, just because of [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=402.1s)]
*  how obvious it was that he was embodying Nico's spirit. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPOeEyTuLQ&t=405.7s)]
