# Former Addict Niall Harbison Saved By Mission To Rescue Street Dogs
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [October 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg)
*  Okay, Nile Harbison is a person whose work I have gotten to know over the past six months [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=0.0s)]
*  or nine months. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=13.96s)]
*  It's an incredibly inspiring story. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=14.96s)]
*  It's a complex story, but the work that he is doing is devoted to the noble and I think [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=17.12s)]
*  inspiring work of rescuing as many street dogs as he can in the place that he now lives, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=23.32s)]
*  which is Thailand. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=28.96s)]
*  He was born in Ireland. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=29.96s)]
*  He has had a series of difficulties in his life that he has very openly talked about [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=31.8s)]
*  and not only talked about the way in which that led him to do this sort of work of rescuing [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=36.44s)]
*  street dogs, but also the ways in which that work that he found has helped him overcome [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=42.4s)]
*  a lot of those problems. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=47.56s)]
*  It's a story, a type of story I hear a lot about being somebody who works myself in the [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=48.72s)]
*  world of dog rescue. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=53.92s)]
*  And I have been very excited to talk to him for a long time because the work that he is [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=55.96s)]
*  doing is genuinely amazing, as is his story, and I want to welcome Nile to our show. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=59.08s)]
*  It's great to see you. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=64.48s)]
*  Thank you so much for taking the time to come on and talk to us. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=65.48s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=69.24s)]
*  It sounds good that you're doing some dog work yourself. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=70.24s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=72.64s)]
*  We have 26 dogs, rescue dogs, in our home and a shelter as well that relies on homeless [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=73.64s)]
*  employees. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=81.16s)]
*  But I want to talk about your story. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=82.16s)]
*  And obviously, part of my interest is based on the work that I've been doing, the impact [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=83.16s)]
*  it had on me, the things that led us to do this work. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=87.56s)]
*  But your story, I think, is so interesting. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=91.75999999999999s)]
*  So let's just begin by talking about the project that you created that began as kind of a small [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=95.75999999999999s)]
*  project, now seems to be growing quite rapidly. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=102.16s)]
*  It has a lot of different impact in a lot of different areas when it comes to dogs. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=104.92s)]
*  Before we get into how you got there and what it's done for you, let's just talk about the [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=110.16s)]
*  project itself and what it is that it's designed to do. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=114.56s)]
*  Yeah, so I came to Thailand and I actually started feeding street dogs. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=117.56s)]
*  I mean, if anybody's been in this part of the world, in Southeast Asia, there's eight [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=123.11999999999999s)]
*  million street dogs in Thailand, which is unfathomable for anybody in the West or America [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=127.03999999999999s)]
*  maybe. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=132.84s)]
*  And they're on every street corner. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=133.84s)]
*  They're outside every shop. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=135.4s)]
*  They really suffer. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=138.07999999999998s)]
*  So I started feeding them, naively thinking that that would be the solution. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=139.07999999999998s)]
*  It's evolved from there into a huge program where we actually sterilize dogs. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=143.20000000000002s)]
*  Sterilizing is like neutering or spaying. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=148.16s)]
*  So we're trying to control the population and we also rehome dogs. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=151.52s)]
*  But our main focus is really on trying to have generational change in how street dogs [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=156.32s)]
*  are treated around the world. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=162.16s)]
*  Generational change. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=163.64000000000001s)]
*  I mean, obviously people can relate to and immediately understand the act of finding [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=165.64000000000001s)]
*  a dog on the street who has been abandoned or homeless or stray. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=170.6s)]
*  They might be suffering from disease or malnutrition and you pick them up and you care for them [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=175.24s)]
*  and you nurse them back to health and you try and find a home for them. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=179.08s)]
*  But what other kinds of more systemic changes are you talking about that you're hoping to [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=182.08s)]
*  be able to implement to make this, because as you say, there's so many dogs in the world [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=185.8s)]
*  that even if you devote yourself every day to what I just described, you're helping a [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=191.0s)]
*  tiny fraction and you're not really redressing the problem. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=194.92000000000002s)]
*  So what kinds of changes does your project look to implement? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=199.24s)]
*  Well without talking badly about anybody else, every organization in the world has failed [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=205.04000000000002s)]
*  at doing this so far. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=214.60000000000002s)]
*  What we're doing at the moment with Dog Rescue is really like a sticky plaster on a heart [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=216.0s)]
*  attack. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=219.56s)]
*  Nobody is directly addressing the core problem, which is overpopulation. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=220.56s)]
*  So our main focus is really three areas. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=228.44s)]
*  One is sterilizing, which is kind of quite boring and people don't get that excited [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=231.34s)]
*  about it. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=236.42s)]
*  It's controlling dog populations and stuff like that. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=237.42s)]
*  People prefer the cute makeover or the really nice rescue story, which we do as well. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=239.76s)]
*  And the second part then is education. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=245.07999999999998s)]
*  So we need to change hearts and minds and really there's a lot of dog lovers in this [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=248.07999999999998s)]
*  part of the world, but they maybe don't have the tools or the knowledge. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=252.44s)]
*  And then the third part, which I haven't got to yet, which is very important, I just call [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=255.74s)]
*  it legislation at the moment, but we need to get governments involved and we need to [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=259.78000000000003s)]
*  really have state participation to fix this problem because there's 500 million street [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=264.46000000000004s)]
*  dogs in the world and my ambition is to halve that in my lifetime. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=270.7s)]
*  So I've got to try and save 250 million dogs, which is challenging, but I think we're on [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=274.66s)]
*  the right path hopefully. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=280.66s)]
*  Yeah, one of the things I've seen your project entail and every dog rescue project that I [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=282.3s)]
*  think has real value that goes beyond just the obvious steps of trying to just randomly [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=287.34000000000003s)]
*  save a few dogs here and there, which is a great thing to do, certainly better than nothing, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=292.1s)]
*  is the idea of public education and sterilization because dogs breed very rapidly and very easily [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=297.02000000000004s)]
*  and very quickly at a very young age and it's sort of like running behind this wheel that [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=305.66s)]
*  just keeps going faster and faster the more you run behind it. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=312.14000000000004s)]
*  If you don't sterilize street dogs, they're just going to keep producing by the thousands [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=316.14000000000004s)]
*  and hundreds of thousands and millions. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=320.70000000000005s)]
*  So what is it that you're doing in that regard? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=322.42s)]
*  Yeah, so a really good analogy is if you think of a bathtub overflowing, the way they think [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=325.66s)]
*  of it is rescue dogs is just sort of mopping up the floor, but what we're trying to do [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=333.34000000000003s)]
*  is turn off the tap so the bath stops overflowing. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=337.66s)]
*  And you're right about rescues. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=343.38s)]
*  A lot of my friends have rescues and people that I respect and love, but they're really [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=345.38s)]
*  drowning in a problem that can never be fixed. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=349.42s)]
*  And it's so sad that, especially with street dogs, it's not a great life to just take them [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=352.54s)]
*  off the street and put them into a rescue where it can often feel like a prison for [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=358.06s)]
*  them. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=363.06s)]
*  So we really want to systematically change the whole outlay for street dogs. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=364.06s)]
*  And we do other things like we feed a thousand street dogs every day. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=370.46s)]
*  We make them really nutritious food with rice and vegetables. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=373.62s)]
*  So there's a thousand dogs every day get a great meal. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=376.58s)]
*  We also provide them with vet care. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=379.54s)]
*  But really the most important is we're up to six thousand operations now every month, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=382.14s)]
*  six thousand sterilizations, which is a tiny, tiny drop in the ocean. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=387.34000000000003s)]
*  But I only started on my own two years ago. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=391.22s)]
*  So I feel like we're making some progress. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=393.74s)]
*  But we we kind of think of it as a sort of a growth startup type way. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=395.86s)]
*  That's my background. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=401.26s)]
*  I used to work in marketing. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=402.26s)]
*  So I'm trying to think of a way to sort of scale it really, really fast because the dogs [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=403.26s)]
*  are out there suffering really horrible, you know, car crashes, poisonings, really bad [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=407.66s)]
*  diseases on a daily basis. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=415.62s)]
*  And I see that and I just want to fix it as quickly as I can. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=417.18s)]
*  So one of the reasons I enjoy so much talking to people who do this and it's not only because [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=420.26s)]
*  people feel good about hearing people devoted to to dogs and eat, although that I think [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=429.1s)]
*  is a very positive aspect, is that it's very rare that people get devoted to this because [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=434.82s)]
*  they say we're born in a family whose parents were devoted to it and they just kind of picked [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=441.42s)]
*  it up. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=446.5s)]
*  It's something that, you know, I think has to be created by something in your life that [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=447.5s)]
*  leads you to this work. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=453.78s)]
*  Sometimes it can just be coincidence, but oftentimes I think it's sort of deeper than [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=456.3s)]
*  that. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=459.58s)]
*  But can you talk about how it is that you ended up as someone born in Ireland, as sort [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=460.58s)]
*  of a resident of and citizen of Ireland who ended up in Thailand, but not just ended up [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=467.26s)]
*  in Thailand, but specifically devoting your life to to dogs and to the effort to protect [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=472.82s)]
*  and save them? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=479.02s)]
*  Yeah, I think you're right. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=480.02s)]
*  Some of the stuff that we see on a daily basis in animal rescue is just horrific. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=482.62s)]
*  You know, I mean, it's the worst of the worst. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=487.14s)]
*  I don't share it online because I don't think people want to see that. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=489.02s)]
*  But you need a special sort of, I don't know, willpower to do it. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=494.18s)]
*  And yet my background was I was an alcoholic and I nearly drank myself to death. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=497.9s)]
*  I ended up in ICU. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=502.62s)]
*  I was addicted to red wine, Valium, everything. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=504.46s)]
*  And I really I was an alcoholic for 25 years and I moved to Thailand, ironically, to try [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=510.14s)]
*  and get healthy because I wanted this quite a drinking culture in Ireland. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=514.46s)]
*  The weather's dark. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=517.86s)]
*  It's cold. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=518.86s)]
*  So I said, you know, go somewhere where the weather is nice and try and get sober. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=519.86s)]
*  The opposite happened. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=523.76s)]
*  I had no family or friends around here. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=524.6800000000001s)]
*  So I went off the rails big time. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=527.5600000000001s)]
*  So I ended up in hospital. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=529.36s)]
*  I've suffered for depression and had some childhood trauma for my whole life. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=531.36s)]
*  And then I just when I was in hospital hooked up to all the machines, I mean, I was nearly dead. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=536.44s)]
*  They were pumping, I don't know what into me to keep me alive. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=541.24s)]
*  But I just said, wow, I can't I need to make a change. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=544.36s)]
*  This, you know, if I do this again, I'm going to die. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=548.52s)]
*  So I walked out of the hospital, never drank again, never. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=550.5600000000001s)]
*  Never took anything again. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=553.72s)]
*  And that was four years ago. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=555.2s)]
*  And once you've come that close to death and seen the sort of, you know, the end, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=556.44s)]
*  everything goes out of life like I don't care about money. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=564.5600000000001s)]
*  I don't care about, you know, material goods or anything. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=566.8000000000001s)]
*  I just want to make a difference for the dogs in their lives. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=569.48s)]
*  And it is an incredibly challenging world. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=573.32s)]
*  Like, really, you see the worst of humanity. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=577.9200000000001s)]
*  You see cruelty. You see neglect. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=579.8000000000001s)]
*  You see you see everything. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=581.88s)]
*  So I think my background of, you know, I saw my mom getting beaten up when I was smaller. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=582.8s)]
*  So seeing that and seeing, you know, nearly dying in hospital, I think, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=588.4s)]
*  makes me able to deal with the dogs because I can go out there and say, right, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=593.12s)]
*  I've seen some pretty bad stuff, but let's get let's get you guys fixed [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=596.56s)]
*  and let's make a difference in the world. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=600.68s)]
*  There is, as I'm sure you know, this kind of rapidly increasing rate of alcoholism [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=602.92s)]
*  and addiction in the modern Western world. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=609.0799999999999s)]
*  We talk a lot about on this show and elsewhere, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=612.04s)]
*  some of the attributes of how life in the West kind of isolates people, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=614.84s)]
*  atomizes people, keeps us behind computer screens. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=621.12s)]
*  We're very much removed from the way that we've evolved as human beings over many centuries. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=626.4s)]
*  And as a result, oftentimes we end up with kind of a lack of connection. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=631.04s)]
*  And I think there's a lot of understanding and knowledge now about addiction and alcoholism [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=635.4s)]
*  of the kind that you suffered, this very severe kind that can that almost killed you, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=639.2s)]
*  that a lot of it just comes from this. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=642.96s)]
*  It's it's not so much, oh, these substances are addictive. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=645.32s)]
*  And if you take them, then you're hooked. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=649.32s)]
*  It really comes from this kind of spiritual deprivation or spiritual illness, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=650.5200000000001s)]
*  kind of a lack of purpose, a lack of connection. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=654.6800000000001s)]
*  And I know so many people who say that their work with dogs [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=657.5200000000001s)]
*  is what finally kind of cured them of that underlying malady. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=661.96s)]
*  It doesn't cure you of everything. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=666.4399999999999s)]
*  It doesn't make your traumas disappear. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=668.04s)]
*  But it's something that gives a kind of connective, a connectiveness that often could be evasive [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=669.68s)]
*  or difficult when dealing with humans or the rest of the world. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=675.04s)]
*  How has that been for you? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=678.16s)]
*  What have I mean? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=679.24s)]
*  Because so often I know when people hear about someone who rescues dogs, they think, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=680.3199999999999s)]
*  oh, that person is doing so much for those dogs. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=684.68s)]
*  It's so nice and benevolent. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=687.3199999999999s)]
*  But in fact, the dogs are doing so much for you as well. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=688.36s)]
*  Can you talk a little bit about what your own experience has been in that regard? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=690.56s)]
*  Yeah, that's a really good point. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=694.4s)]
*  I think that the dogs have saved me as much as I've saved them. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=695.56s)]
*  Like, I don't think like I've obviously got an addictive personality. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=698.28s)]
*  So I don't think it's wrong to say that I'm addicted to the [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=701.3199999999999s)]
*  feeling of joy that I get in saving a dog. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=705.52s)]
*  So, you know, as an alcoholic, I was probably not very reliable, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=709.0s)]
*  you know, would not show up on time and stuff like that or show up at all. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=714.0799999999999s)]
*  So being able to show up every day and bring the dogs a simple meal and see their tails wagging [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=718.7199999999999s)]
*  and see them like they depend on you. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=723.88s)]
*  So it's a lovely feeling to have that. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=725.48s)]
*  And you do have that connection with the dogs. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=727.76s)]
*  Like I feed over 100 every day. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=730.2s)]
*  Personally, we feed a thousand around the island with volunteers. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=732.8s)]
*  And those 100 dogs are, you know, looking into your eyes and excited to see you. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=735.56s)]
*  And there is a real connection. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=741.04s)]
*  And you're completely right, because when I then finish the dogs about 10 or 11, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=742.72s)]
*  I walk into a coffee place to have a coffee and I look around everybody staring at their phone. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=747.4s)]
*  The latest news is on. It's depressing. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=753.08s)]
*  It's, you know, people ironically come to Thailand to escape the rat race and to escape the nine to five [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=755.4s)]
*  and all the pressures of life. But then the first thing they're doing here is I look at them. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=761.4s)]
*  They're staring at their phones instead of looking at the beautiful view. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=764.4s)]
*  And I'm as guilty as anybody of looking at my phone. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=767.56s)]
*  It's a it's a very addictive monster that we have in our pocket at all times. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=770.0s)]
*  But that the connection with the dogs is is beautiful. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=775.04s)]
*  And, yeah, it would be nice to go back to that way of life full time for a lot of people. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=778.36s)]
*  But it's yeah, dogs are fantastic. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=782.56s)]
*  I think there's sort of sometimes, first of all, people love dog rescue stories as content online. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=785.68s)]
*  There are a few things that viralize as much that make people as happy. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=793.16s)]
*  You know, from the beginning, the Internet was sort of driven by consumption of porn and animal stories, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=796.5999999999999s)]
*  you know, of all kinds. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=805.68s)]
*  And for all the talk about how, you know, oh, dogs, animals are meant to be eaten and all of this. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=807.04s)]
*  People clearly have a sort of inbuilt empathy for animals that moves them emotionally when they see them online, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=812.8s)]
*  not just dogs, but certainly especially dogs as well. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=819.8s)]
*  As you say, it can it's not always a happy ending. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=822.4s)]
*  It's not always easy because you're dealing with a lot of sad cases, a lot of difficult cases, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=825.2s)]
*  cases that don't have a happy ending. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=829.32s)]
*  But what about people who are sort of cynical and say, yeah, it seems kind of nice that you're helping these dogs, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=831.0400000000001s)]
*  but there's at least as much, if not more, human suffering. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=839.28s)]
*  And as humans, our obligation ought to be to prioritize the alleviation of human suffering and not the suffering of animals. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=844.2s)]
*  How do you think about that? [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=851.52s)]
*  Well, I think humans are doing each other enough damage that they can figure it out themselves is my kind of logic on the thing. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=853.92s)]
*  No, it's the thing with the dogs is I share content that's really positive and uplifting. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=861.5999999999999s)]
*  Like I kind of edit it for one of a better reasons to put it into the world. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=867.92s)]
*  When I started this, I was like, OK, I know how to make content. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=872.0s)]
*  I can go down the traditional route, which, you know, every rescue and dog charity around the world does. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=876.64s)]
*  They need to show the suffering. But if you're on the subway in New York or you're driving in, you know, London, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=882.12s)]
*  you don't want to I don't want to scroll and see some dog with half its head missing and blood and guts. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=888.24s)]
*  And like you want to see something positive. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=894.72s)]
*  So I try and put positive stories out there where you show the change that's been made, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=897.32s)]
*  you show a recovery of an animal and it puts like we offer a solution as well. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=902.44s)]
*  Like it's not just saying like send us money immediately. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=908.4399999999999s)]
*  We're going to close down where, you know, that's unfortunately the world that a lot of dog rescues live in, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=911.4s)]
*  whereas I'm trying to create something where there's a real tangible solution. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=915.88s)]
*  And, you know, the work that we do by sterilizing all those dogs like we'll sterilize 50,000 dogs this year, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=920.04s)]
*  which will stop half a million dogs coming into the world. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=925.9599999999999s)]
*  That's a little bit abstract when you hear those numbers. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=928.8s)]
*  But like half a million dogs won't be born into suffering because of what we do this year. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=931.0799999999999s)]
*  So I think it's really important to focus on the positives. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=934.9599999999999s)]
*  And in terms of should we be coming up with something like I mean, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=939.0s)]
*  I look at the oceans around here beside me or the sea and it's, you know, troll full of plastic and horrible. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=942.7199999999999s)]
*  But that's a huge problem on its own. And I'm not the one to fix that. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=949.12s)]
*  I'm going to focus on the dogs, which is hard enough as it is to tackle. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=952.64s)]
*  And hopefully somebody else will focus on the other problems. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=957.4799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, the idea of trying to prioritize, you know, suffering or needs, you know, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=960.72s)]
*  if you did focus on humans and giving people education, you would say, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=966.64s)]
*  oh, why are you focusing on humans in the United States? [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=970.76s)]
*  There's children who are in Sudan or in Somalia who are suffering even worse. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=973.44s)]
*  And I think, you know, anybody who's trying to lessen suffering in the world is inherently doing a double thing [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=977.48s)]
*  in the attempt to say, oh, no, objectively, there's something you should be doing differently [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=984.88s)]
*  is a byproduct of cynicism. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=989.12s)]
*  One of the reasons I found your work online is because it really is compelling. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=991.9599999999999s)]
*  You know, you tell a story in a way that I think only someone truly devoted to this work can do. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=996.56s)]
*  And you tell it in a way that individualizes the story and personality of each dog and their recovery. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=1002.0s)]
*  And that's something that's not easy to do. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=1009.76s)]
*  So for those people who are interested in your work, who want to support it, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=1011.68s)]
*  but especially who want to follow it and understand it, where where can people find you? [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=1015.28s)]
*  I'd say the two best places are on X or whatever we're calling it these days, just my name and Instagram. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=1020.12s)]
*  My name as well is the charity is HappyDoggo.com. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=1026.48s)]
*  But, yeah, I'm not hard to find that it's just positive uplifting dog content without any pressure on, you know, [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=1030.6s)]
*  I think you can just follow along and feel inspired and a dark world that we sometimes live in. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=1036.12s)]

*  but not in a artificial or syrupy way, but in a very genuine and kind of devoted way, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=1049.04s)]
*  I think is cleansing for the human soul. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=1054.2s)]
*  It certainly has that effect on me when I look at your content. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMqHVFeNAPg&t=1057.48s)]
