# Steve Bannon: "Walk the F*ck Away" from Ukraine Economic Partnership Deal
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [February 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk)
*  Well, I brought this very issue up with Bennett. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=0.0s)]
*  And meaning the issue of this economic partnership [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  arrangement that's being forged now between the US and Ukraine. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=15.32s)]
*  And he didn't seem particularly thrilled about it. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  So let's have a look. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=24.04s)]
*  Let me ask you about the Ukraine war resolution, because there's this [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=26.44s)]
*  framework now being proposed. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=28.96s)]
*  It's a little ambiguous. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=30.68s)]
*  An economic partnership agreement. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=32.24s)]
*  Besant was in Kiev saying that in exchange for your agreement [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=34.4s)]
*  to this partnership, US aid will continue. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=39.6s)]
*  Donald Trump himself said it's kind of haphazardly, but he did say aid [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=42.6s)]
*  could continue under this framework. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  It seems like this is a further it's going to be a further entanglement [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=47.84s)]
*  of the US in Ukraine. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=50.92s)]
*  And who's going to extract the rare minerals? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=52.24s)]
*  Much of them are under Russian occupation. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=54.72s)]
*  My advice is walk the fuck away. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=57.4s)]
*  I want to walk away so hard. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=61.16s)]
*  I'm even prepared to say, OK, maybe we don't even investigate, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=63.2s)]
*  which I think we have to. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=66.24s)]
*  But we have to walk away. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=67.64s)]
*  I don't want their minerals. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=69.0s)]
*  OK, there's enough minerals in the rest of the world. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=70.44s)]
*  What's the reasoning behind this proposal? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=72.6s)]
*  I think President Trump looks at Iraq and looks at other places [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=74.72s)]
*  in Afghanistan. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=77.2s)]
*  And I think as a deal guy sitting there going, look, remember, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=78.2s)]
*  in Iraq and Afghanistan, the net didn't take the oil. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=80.84s)]
*  The net president already didn't take the minerals in Afghanistan. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=83.56s)]
*  The net present value of our expedition, it was $9 trillion. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=86.56s)]
*  Think of what this country would be like, that if the last 20 years [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=91.52s)]
*  we spent $9 trillion in rebuilding America, the factories would have, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=94.92s)]
*  what would Detroit be like? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=99.68s)]
*  What would St. Louis be like? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=100.8s)]
*  What would Baltimore be like? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=101.88s)]
*  What would the great cities of the East be like? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=103.4s)]
*  What would Detroit be like? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=105.0s)]
*  If we spent $9 trillion on American citizens, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=106.2s)]
*  on the soil of the United States of America, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=110.64s)]
*  this would be a paradise. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=112.80000000000001s)]
*  We didn't. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=114.04s)]
*  We pissed it away and let people steal it. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=114.72000000000001s)]
*  And so many people dead. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=117.0s)]
*  And countries ruined and cultures ruined. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=118.84s)]
*  And the Christians eviscerated for $9 trillion. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=120.68s)]
*  I think it says some President Trump says, look, if these guys did it, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=123.44000000000001s)]
*  what we should do is at least get something for it. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=127.24000000000001s)]
*  I mean, that's the way he's. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=129.20000000000002s)]
*  Exchange for a security guarantee, though, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=130.0s)]
*  which could necessitate or require some kind of US military action. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=131.88s)]
*  In fact, speaking of World War II, it reminds me of the British, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=135.48000000000002s)]
*  arguably very foolishly extending Poland a so-called security [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=138.96s)]
*  guarantee that they didn't have the ability to even uphold. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=142.0s)]
*  And then World War II gets declared once Hitler goes into Poland. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=145.20000000000002s)]
*  Now, that's a very extreme scenario. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=148.64000000000001s)]
*  But a security guarantee, I mean, those don't have a great record [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=150.76000000000002s)]
*  throughout history. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=153.88s)]
*  Very few people understand that. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=154.84s)]
*  The reason that World War II, which had been building in the same kind of way [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=156.60000000000002s)]
*  this is, triggered in September 1939, is because the Germans knew it. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=159.72s)]
*  And the Germans also knew that the French and the British couldn't stand up to it. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=164.96s)]
*  And that would give them every pretext to roll across Western Europe. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=169.64s)]
*  They walked into a soccer's play. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=172.32s)]
*  Look, the United States of America, we're the new world. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=174.0s)]
*  Our families were kicked out of these countries, right? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=178.0s)]
*  Very few people that came here from anywhere in Europe, right? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=180.88s)]
*  Much less Africa or Asia, these other places. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=184.12s)]
*  Voluntarily, my family was fucking kicked out of Ireland and [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=186.44s)]
*  then kicked out of Liverpool and came here, right? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=189.24s)]
*  Ireland, the only time you got a shot, and I gotta tell you, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=191.4s)]
*  when I was coming up, different when Mo came up with the Irish dancing and [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=194.88s)]
*  Riverdance, when I came up, I never heard anybody say anything about the wish we [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=198.0s)]
*  were back in the old country, cuz it's a fucking shithole, right? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=201.96s)]
*  And we were treated like shit, okay? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=204.84s)]
*  That's- I'm from Peasants in Italy too. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=206.8s)]
*  But that's my point. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=208.52s)]
*  Everybody that came here came for a reason. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=209.56s)]
*  We were kicked out of every decent country in the world, okay? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=211.12s)]
*  We bailed them out in World War I. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=214.16s)]
*  We went back and bailed them out in World War II. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=216.28s)]
*  We then hung around and bailed them out in the Cold War. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=218.52s)]
*  Third time's the charm. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=220.72s)]
*  I totally respect President Trump. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=221.96s)]
*  I understand his mindset. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=223.60000000000002s)]
*  We have to get something for this effort. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=224.8s)]
*  But I say, if you get something for the effort, next thing you know, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=226.48s)]
*  you're gonna have to have private companies invest. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=229.04s)]
*  We gotta protect that. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=230.51999999999998s)]
*  They're gonna want a security guarantee. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=231.48s)]
*  Plus, they're gonna want us part of the reconstruction. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=232.92s)]
*  We don't want any of that. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=234.83999999999997s)]
*  It's all bloodlands. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=236.04s)]
*  That is a cursed part of the world, okay? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=237.28s)]
*  Those folks are gonna have to work it out. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=239.79999999999998s)]
*  They've been trying to work it out for a couple thousand years. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=241.56s)]
*  They're gonna be trying to work it out a couple thousand years from now. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=243.32s)]
*  It's not our fight, okay? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=245.64s)]
*  And the vital, vital national security interests of the United States is not in [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=247.6s)]
*  the Ukraine, good God. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=252.48s)]
*  We had Eisenhower and General Marshall and Field Marshal Montgomery. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=253.95999999999998s)]
*  We had the greatest military minds of the 20th century. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=257.47999999999996s)]
*  He said, under no circumstances will we ever send troops into the Balkans, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=259.56s)]
*  much less up into Ukraine. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=263.91999999999996s)]
*  Right now, as we're speaking here, there's a brigade of the 101st Airborne of [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=265.03999999999996s)]
*  boys and girls from the United States of America on the remaining Ukrainian border [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=269.59999999999997s)]
*  set to go in there at a moment's notice. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=273.59999999999997s)]
*  We have to pull all back. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=275.84s)]
*  There should be no security guarantee. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=277.2s)]
*  There should be no more assistance whatsoever of anything. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=279.28s)]
*  We just even say, just keep the frickin' money, okay? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=282.16s)]
*  These horrible people did it. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=285.96s)]
*  I've even been able to give on something I've been adamant about. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=287.28000000000003s)]
*  I would even, to get out of there, say no investigation. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=290.96s)]
*  If you had promised me we would have no security, no investment, nothing, right? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=293.28000000000003s)]
*  I would say, okay, let them keep the money they stole. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=297.56s)]
*  What about the- [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=300.8s)]
*  But just to get out, that's how adamant I am about it. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=301.64s)]
*  What about this notion of the US taking over Gaza? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=303.8s)]
*  I mean, I've heard it speculated that maybe Trump made that proposal as [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=306.32s)]
*  an opening negotiating gambit, but doesn't seem like there's very much appetite at all [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=310.68s)]
*  under really any conceivable circumstances for the Arab states to take in 1.8 million [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=315.2s)]
*  Palestinians from Gaza. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=319.8s)]
*  And for the US to turn Gaza now into some sort of military protectorate, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=321.4s)]
*  I know it's not clear if troops would be required or whatever, but, you know, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=325.24s)]
*  I don't remember many people in 2024 during the campaign agitating for the US [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=329.8s)]
*  to take territorial control of Gaza, including people who voted for Donald Trump. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=333.76s)]
*  So how does that relate to this idea that people have an expectation of Trump [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=338.12s)]
*  reducing foreign entanglements if that idea were to come to full fruition? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=342.24s)]
*  I think the basic thesis of America First is exactly what I was saying. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=345.96s)]
*  We've gotten into a situation around the rim of Eurasian landmass in Western Europe, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=349.0s)]
*  in the Gulf Emirates, and with Israel, and down straight to Malacca in the South China Sea, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=353.24s)]
*  and then back around to South Korea and Japan, that those are four nodes of the world [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=358.32s)]
*  where we have huge commercial relationships, trade deals, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=363.6s)]
*  capital markets, joint capital markets, cultural ties, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=368.56s)]
*  but it's all underwritten by an American security guarantee. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=372.72s)]
*  They're all protectorates of the United States. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=375.16s)]
*  It's the reason that with the NDAA at $900 billion, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=377.08000000000004s)]
*  the Pentagon's back over for another 150. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=381.72s)]
*  House Republicans wanted up another 100 billion. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=384.48s)]
*  Senate Republicans want it 150, of course. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=386.92s)]
*  150, 150. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=388.56s)]
*  So that's over $3 million. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=389.68s)]
*  It's really overtrained today, but now they're just saying it straight out. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=391.16s)]
*  We are not an empire. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=394.44s)]
*  We are built on a revolutionary idea. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=397.12s)]
*  We are, in effect. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=399.52s)]
*  We may not want to be or not conceptualize ourselves as. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=400.68s)]
*  It's not our roots are anti-colonialism. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=403.72s)]
*  Until McKinley, who Trump valorized in his inaugural address, oddly, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=407.92s)]
*  I guess people forgot about the Philippine War, which is not the prettiest picture. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=411.36s)]
*  Spanish-American War. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=415.28000000000003s)]
*  Got picked up some quick ones. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=417.04s)]
*  So President Trump, America first, is that on Gaza, I will tell you, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=420.0s)]
*  I think what President Trump is saying is that we've tried the same thing over and over and over again. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=423.88s)]
*  He's not going to fall into that. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=429.35999999999996s)]
*  Now, I believe he's playing five dimension chess, 5D chess, right? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=430.76s)]
*  So there, I don't. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=435.08s)]
*  We could be up to like 75 dimensional chess. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=437.47999999999996s)]
*  I don't understand. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=439.35999999999996s)]
*  But I'll tell you, I think he's changed the dialogue already. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=440.08s)]
*  One thing that people miss, I think is very important. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=442.4s)]
*  Bibi came over to come over to do one thing. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=445.47999999999996s)]
*  And that's to get a guarantee of American support for military action into Persia, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=449.56s)]
*  either the nuclear plant or maybe even some sort of land war. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=454.88s)]
*  That, my understanding, was not was barely discussed. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=458.35999999999996s)]
*  And the reason was Trump had his Gaza plan. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=461.96s)]
*  So if the Gaza idea, the Gaza concept takes everybody off a military action in Persia, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=464.52s)]
*  which I adamantly am opposed to, and I'm pro-Israel, I think it was a good thing. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=469.88s)]
*  And I think that's might have might have been what happened. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=474.96s)]
*  But other than that, he's playing five dimension chess. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=476.84s)]
*  All right, we'll see. All right. Thanks a lot, Steve. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=479.76s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=481.08s)]
*  All right. So they're interestingly enough, Steve Bannon is expressing his fairly [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=483.4s)]
*  vehement opposition to this economic partnership arrangement that today we [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=490.59999999999997s)]
*  finally have seen the latest text of. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=497.84s)]
*  He's saying hell. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=501.47999999999996s)]
*  What he would like is for the United States to just write off all the monies that it's [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=503.68s)]
*  dispersed to Ukraine without seeking repayment of some sort so the US can actually [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=509.64s)]
*  disengage itself from what Bannon calls that cursed part of the world. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=516.28s)]
*  But really, I mean, if you look at the details of what this partnership agreement [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=522.1999999999999s)]
*  seems to entail, this could be the exact opposite of that. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=525.1999999999999s)]
*  And the US could now be engrossed in this quasi-colonial mercantilist situation with [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=530.52s)]
*  Ukraine, where similar to Gaza, Ukraine could become a form of like a US protectorate. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=540.8s)]
*  It already functionally is, but maybe this could formalize that on a different level. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=547.4s)]
*  So it's interesting to contrast Bannon's preferences with that of Trump administration [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=554.16s)]
*  policy. As far as we know, Bannon has no formal role in the current Trump White House. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=562.28s)]
*  He did serve for I think it was nine months or so in the first Trump administration. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=569.16s)]
*  But now he's kind of like an outside agitator. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=574.0799999999999s)]
*  He's trashing Elon Musk. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=578.28s)]
*  A lot of the journalists that were coming off to Bannon at CPAC just wanted to get their [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=580.12s)]
*  quote from him castigating Elon Musk. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=583.4399999999999s)]
*  I mean, I find that to be somewhat interesting, but I did want to get to other topics with [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=588.9599999999999s)]
*  him. But yeah, Bannon's been on a rampage against Musk, calling him like an illegal [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=593.7199999999999s)]
*  immigrant and stuff. So you have that aspect of this broader tension going on in the [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=599.0799999999999s)]
*  right wing, a Republican coalition. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=606.92s)]
*  How do you reconcile somebody who Bannon regards in the form of Musk as this transhumanist [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=608.88s)]
*  who is really just an incidental right winger who is just sort of trying to force [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=616.76s)]
*  himself into the coalition as this kingmaker and doesn't have its best interests at [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=626.6s)]
*  heart? And then also Bannon's view of these foreign policy initiatives, Ukraine. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=632.08s)]
*  And then as I brought up to him, Gaza, which we're told now is another example of Trump [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=638.08s)]
*  playing, you know, multi-dimensional chess, either five dimensional chess or seventy five [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=643.5600000000001s)]
*  dimensional chess. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=648.5200000000001s)]
*  Liz Trust said that you have to look at it through a certain prism of interpretation [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=650.1600000000001s)]
*  where it's just some kind of negotiating gambit, perhaps Bannon repeated the same logic. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=655.1999999999999s)]
*  Look, I mean, I don't have a crystal ball. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=665.0s)]
*  I can't tell you with any degree of certainty what is ultimately going to come of Gaza. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=666.48s)]
*  But it does seem to me that the fact that this proposal is out there kind of complicates [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=672.04s)]
*  even the maintenance of what is currently a very fragile and tentative ceasefire framework. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=678.4799999999999s)]
*  Because the first stage of the ceasefire framework that came into effect just as Trump [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=687.28s)]
*  was taking office is scheduled to expire within a matter of days. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=691.28s)]
*  And so does it undermine any further negotiations if Hamas has been told over and over again [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=696.4s)]
*  by Trump? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=703.64s)]
*  But it's not like this was a one off comment. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=704.56s)]
*  Trump read prepared remarks when he made the proposal for the Gaza takeover at a joint [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=706.1199999999999s)]
*  event with Netanyahu and has repeated it in subsequent statements. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=712.2399999999999s)]
*  What effect does that have on the continuation of the current ceasefire framework, which, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=719.4s)]
*  as I said, is going to expire in just a few days? [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=725.88s)]
*  So the point being, even if we can't know with any certainty whether this Gaza takeover [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=729.2800000000001s)]
*  plan is going to come to fruition, the fact that the proposal has been made alone has [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=735.5200000000001s)]
*  certain consequences for other live issues going on at the moment. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=741.9200000000001s)]
*  So it's not just about like a future forecast as to whether this is a viable thing. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=750.6800000000001s)]
*  It could also have real world implications. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OIK9PVxNk&t=754.44s)]
