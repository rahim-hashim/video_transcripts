# Arizona Mom Unjustly Arrested for FREE SPEECH
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [September 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM)
*  I want to ask you about this victory that you had because when I saw this video, and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm so glad when I heard that you guys intervened immediately, in one way it was kind of shocking [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=11.56s)]
*  to see people who are elected officials who were sworn an oath to the Constitution, who [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=18.28s)]
*  are not young people. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=23.86s)]
*  You know, in their 60s, 70s, who I thought would have been indoctrinated with just kind [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=25.96s)]
*  of a reflex or an instinct of free speech, just so flagrantly and explicitly violated [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=30.16s)]
*  at a kind of temple of democracy, which is the ability of citizens to come and criticize [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=35.96s)]
*  or petition or lay bare allegations against their government officials. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=41.52s)]
*  So let's watch the video because I found it, on the one hand, not surprising, but on the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=47.2s)]
*  other hand shocking. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=51.64s)]
*  So let's take a look at this first. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=52.64s)]
*  You're violating my First Amendment rights. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=54.68s)]
*  I have certain inalienable rights and they were not only trampled on, but the mayor essentially [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=57.76s)]
*  weaponized the police force to shut me up. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=63.44s)]
*  To request? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=65.88s)]
*  I've got to interrupt. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=66.88s)]
*  There are oral communications during the city council meeting. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=67.88s)]
*  You may not be used to lodge charges or complaints against any employee of the city. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=70.84s)]
*  This is your warning. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=76.48s)]
*  A warning for what? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=77.48s)]
*  A warning for attacking the city attorney personally. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=78.48s)]
*  This is what you agreed to when you first speaking. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=81.84s)]
*  This is the form. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=85.68s)]
*  It is unconstitutional Mayor Hall. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=86.68s)]
*  Well, it's not unconstitutional. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=88.8s)]
*  It is. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=90.56s)]
*  Chief, could you have somebody come down here and escort Ms. Massey out of this chamber? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=91.56s)]
*  Really? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=95.08s)]
*  Is that necessary? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=96.08s)]
*  Um, I'm, no, I'm expressing my... [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=97.08s)]
*  Do not touch me. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=100.16s)]
*  Do not put your hands on me. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=101.16s)]
*  I'm out with you now. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=102.16s)]
*  Are you detaining me? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=103.16s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=104.16s)]
*  Why am I being detained? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=105.16s)]
*  Under what charges? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=106.16s)]
*  Why am I being detained? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=107.47999999999999s)]
*  Under what charges? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=108.47999999999999s)]
*  So there's a lot going on there. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=114.8s)]
*  That's the fire video, but it showed it very, very faithfully. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=115.8s)]
*  And there's so much going on there, including while it's shocking to hear a mayor of a city [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=121.32s)]
*  specifically say you're a ban from coming to public meetings and criticizing or launching [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=125.19999999999999s)]
*  allegations against elected officials. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=129.62s)]
*  I do think it reflects this kind of erosion of the instinct of free speech, this constant [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=133.34s)]
*  normalization of censorship. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=137.98000000000002s)]
*  But on the other hand, it was very inspiring to watch her just stand so firm and so informed [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=138.98000000000002s)]
*  about what her rights are. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=144.98000000000002s)]
*  And she was just so offended by the idea that she would be told she can't express that. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=146.14000000000001s)]
*  So what was, obviously I understand what motivated your involvement, but talk about what you [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=149.66000000000003s)]
*  ended up doing and what the outcome was. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=155.02s)]
*  Yeah, a baseline free speech principle is that the government can't engage in viewpoint [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=158.54000000000002s)]
*  discrimination. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=163.78s)]
*  And Rebecca, in this case, went to her city council meeting, criticized the salary of [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=164.78s)]
*  a city employee, and for that faced criminal charges and expulsion from a meeting. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=171.34s)]
*  Right? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=176.54000000000002s)]
*  You can say nice things about city employees, but you can't criticize them as the city council [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=177.54000000000002s)]
*  person was saying there. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=184.3s)]
*  I think it was the mayor. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=186.3s)]
*  I think it was the mayor, actually. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=188.02s)]
*  Oh, the mayor. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=189.02s)]
*  Yeah, the mayor. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=190.02s)]
*  It was a flagrant violation of the First Amendment. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=191.02s)]
*  And I just got word, actually, that it seems like the city has revoked that rule, but our [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=195.42000000000002s)]
*  lawsuit is still ongoing. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=200.26000000000002s)]
*  We jumped in and filed a lawsuit as soon as we saw this, because it was absolutely absurd. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=201.78s)]
*  And we have represented other people across the country who have been subject to these [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=205.98000000000002s)]
*  rules restricting what can and can't be said during public comment periods of city council [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=211.10000000000002s)]
*  meetings. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=216.02s)]
*  In East Point, Michigan, for example, there were a number of residents who were restricted [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=217.02s)]
*  from criticizing the mayor there. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=221.34s)]
*  We filed a lawsuit. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=223.62s)]
*  It settled. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=224.62s)]
*  And now, actually, in East Point, Michigan, they have an annual First Amendment day as [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=225.62s)]
*  part of the settlement as a way to kind of educate and celebrate the First Amendment [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=229.62s)]
*  that was ignored when the citizens were previously trying to speak out in the form of democracy. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=234.86s)]
*  But, Niko, I want to ask you this question, not because I'm trying to make a rhetorical [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=243.78s)]
*  point, because I genuinely don't understand and want to see what insight you have into [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=246.98s)]
*  it. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=250.14000000000001s)]
*  Like I said, I understand that if there's a 19-year-old or 20-year-old who has been steeped [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=251.14000000000001s)]
*  in TikTok, left-wing culture, and arrives at a left-wing academic institution where [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=255.5s)]
*  they're hearing about the evils of free speech, or rather hate speech, and the need to have [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=259.06s)]
*  speech codes, maybe there's not a developed instinct of what America is and what we're [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=262.58s)]
*  told it is, which leads with the idea that we allow for free speech. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=267.62s)]
*  That's so fundamental to the American identity. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=270.82s)]
*  I was watching that video, I just couldn't believe, not only that the mayor was saying [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=274.38s)]
*  you're not allowed to criticize us, that's against the rules, but everyone on that podium [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=278.58s)]
*  who was members of city council, these are elected officials who are mature. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=283.1s)]
*  It would have been previously unthinkable to me to hear somebody in such an explicit [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=287.53999999999996s)]
*  way impose this rule that is so antithetical, not even like a debatable or kind of limited [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=291.6s)]
*  case, but just so core attack on what we're taught to believe. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=300.42s)]
*  What do you think, and like I said, it's not even that it was shocking, it's kind of almost [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=305.02000000000004s)]
*  normal now. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=309.32s)]
*  You see this mentality arising in so many places. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=310.32s)]
*  Why do you think that is? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=312.74s)]
*  Well, it's hard to say, and I'm reluctant to say it was better at one time than it was [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=314.26s)]
*  at another, but I think there's just a lack of understanding of what the First Amendment [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=320.46000000000004s)]
*  is and what it protects. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=326.14s)]
*  You've got to assume good motives that people actually believe that what they're doing is [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=328.34000000000003s)]
*  constitutional even if they don't understand the constitution, but I think we're educating [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=334.1s)]
*  a generation and maybe the generation that's tasked with educating younger generations [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=338.66s)]
*  because they don't understand First Amendment principles, these principles aren't being [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=344.56s)]
*  passed around. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=348.94000000000005s)]
*  Alan Charles Coors, FIRE's co-founder, said, a nation that does not educate in liberty [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=349.94000000000005s)]
*  will not long preserve liberty and will not even know what it's lost. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=353.0s)]
*  FIRE recently conducted a survey of 59,000 college students, the largest ever survey [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=357.02s)]
*  conducted of college students on free speech issues, and it found that 32% of students [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=361.18s)]
*  said that using violence to stop a campus speech is acceptable to some degree. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=366.14s)]
*  That's up from 27% last year and 20% two years ago. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=370.44s)]
*  So not only are students not learning the values of the First Amendment, we have adults [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=374.9s)]
*  that aren't teaching it, and as you see in that video with the mayor, clearly not reflecting [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=380.62s)]
*  those values or respecting them. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu4Kmt-ZlMM&t=386.0s)]
