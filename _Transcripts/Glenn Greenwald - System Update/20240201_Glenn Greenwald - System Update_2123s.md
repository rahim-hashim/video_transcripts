# INTERVIEW: Omali Yeshitela, Facing 15-Years for “Pro-Russian Propaganda”
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [February 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU)
*  This democratic fixation on Russia is now resulting in a criminal process, a very serious [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=0.0s)]
*  one, charging American citizens who are lifelong political activists, leftist anti-war activists [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=13.68s)]
*  of the kind of old left that opposes US imperialism, that of course is going to be opposed to a [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=20.6s)]
*  NATO war in Europe in order to weaken Russia. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=27.04s)]
*  And because these citizens, all of whom belong to this black left-wing socialist party, are [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  outspoken opponents of Joe Biden's policy in the war in Ukraine, the Biden Justice Department [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=36.8s)]
*  decided to charge them with the felony of being agents of the Kremlin and failing to [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=41.6s)]
*  file the required forms on the flimsiest basis imaginable. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=47.36s)]
*  Here's the AP reporting on the indictment when it was first unveiled in April. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=54.12s)]
*  The US charges four Americans and three Russians in an election discord case. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=58.44s)]
*  The four Americans are all part of the African People's Socialist Party and a Haru movement, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=63.48s)]
*  which is located in St. Petersburg, Florida and St. Louis. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=69.12s)]
*  Among those charged is Amalia Yashalita, chairman of the US-based organization, which was raided [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=72.84s)]
*  by the FBI last summer when the Russian also accused Yanov was originally charged. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=77.8s)]
*  Much of the alleged cooperation involves support for Russia's invasion of Ukraine. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=84.67999999999999s)]
*  In March 2022, Yashatella held a news conference in which he said, quote, the African People's [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=90.32s)]
*  Socialist Party calls for unity with Russia and its defensive war in Ukraine against the [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=95.92s)]
*  world's colonial powers. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=101.4s)]
*  He also called for the independence of the Russian-occupied Donetsk region in eastern [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=103.68s)]
*  Ukraine. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=109.4s)]
*  Now, feel free to disagree with that view. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=110.4s)]
*  I've never argued the Russians are justified, but when I had Norman Finkelstein on my show, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=113.92s)]
*  he actually yelled at me for only limiting myself to opposing US support for Ukraine, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=119.5s)]
*  telling me that if I really believed all the arguments I was making, which he does, namely [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=124.56s)]
*  that NATO is purposely expanding as much up to the Russian border eastward as possible [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=129.72s)]
*  in a way to deliberately threaten and provoke the Russians, that you should have to believe [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=136.4s)]
*  that the Russians were justified in that invasion. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=140.88s)]
*  That's a position that he believes, that it was NATO and the US who provoked the war. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=143.24s)]
*  You can disagree with that, but the fact that Norman Finkelstein believes that is completely [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=149.44s)]
*  given how consistent it is with everything he's argued his whole life. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=155.84s)]
*  If someone were to try and tell me that he was only advocating that because he was a [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=160.16s)]
*  Russian agent, I would laugh in their face. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=163.4s)]
*  It's so obvious that that's a view he reached through his own intellectual autonomy. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=167.52s)]
*  It's the natural byproduct of his ideology. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=172.24s)]
*  And the same is true for this left-wing party. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=176.0s)]
*  It would be shocking if they did anything other than side with Russia against NATO, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=178.32s)]
*  given their five-decade history of opposing US foreign policy from the left. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=183.92s)]
*  And yet, here's the Department of Justice, the Office of Public Affairs, announcing their [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=189.48s)]
*  indictment, quote, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=194.72s)]
*  Now, we have seen for seven years how dangerous these concepts are of every time you say something [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=214.76s)]
*  that aligns with Russian interests, even if that's not your motive, you get accused of [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=223.2s)]
*  being a pro-Russian propagandist. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=228.92s)]
*  In fact, we've deconstructed studies before that accused acts of allowing pro-Russian [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=230.64s)]
*  propaganda when all they meant by that is anybody who says anything that promotes the [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=236.56s)]
*  interests of the Russian government. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=242.2s)]
*  So if you don't want the United States government to fund the war in Ukraine, which is every [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=243.36s)]
*  bit your right as an American citizen to advocate, it of course is a view that aligns with the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=248.68s)]
*  interests of the Russian government. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=254.12s)]
*  That doesn't mean that you're acting on behalf of the Russian government or at its [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=256.6s)]
*  behest or at its direction. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=259.92s)]
*  Anything that you argue might happen to align with the interests of Russia. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=263.72s)]
*  People who opposed coups and Cold Wars during the Cold War in the name of fighting the [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=269.96s)]
*  Soviet Union were advocating views that might have aligned with Russian interests. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=276.28s)]
*  It didn't mean they were agents of the Kremlin. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=281.08s)]
*  Here's the DOJ's press release, quote, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=285.28s)]
*  In the United States. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=300.79999999999995s)]
*  Among other conduct, the indictment alleges that the Russian defendants recruited, funded [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=302.56s)]
*  and directed U.S. political groups to act as unregistered illegal agents of the Russian [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=306.71999999999997s)]
*  government and so discord and spread pro-Russian propaganda. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=311.71999999999997s)]
*  The indicted intelligence officers in particular participated in covertly funding and directing [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=317.56s)]
*  candidates for local office for the United States. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=323.24s)]
*  Russia's foreign intelligence service allegedly weaponized our First Amendment rights. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=326.8s)]
*  Freedom Russia denies to its own citizens to divide Americans and interfere in elections [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=330.84000000000003s)]
*  in the United States, said the assistant attorney general responsible for this indictment. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=336.04s)]
*  This department will not hesitate to expose and prosecute those who so discord and corrupt [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=341.96000000000004s)]
*  U.S. elections in service of foreign interests, regardless of whether the culprit are U.S. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=346.32s)]
*  citizens or foreign individuals abroad. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=350.92s)]
*  If you look at the indictment, other than the receipt over six years of a trivial sum [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=356.76s)]
*  of money by this party, $7,000 over six years that the U.S. government alleges came not [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=364.78s)]
*  from Russians, but Russians affiliated with the Russian government, the entire indictment [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=372.68s)]
*  is based entirely and exclusively on the political activism and the political advocacy of this [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=377.42s)]
*  party and its members and is trying to criminalize their political opinion, to criminalize their [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=383.24s)]
*  dissent against the U.S. government. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=389.40000000000003s)]
*  And what's amazing is there was so little coverage of this case, in part because right-wing [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=393.36s)]
*  media were reluctant to rise in defense of a black left-wing socialist party. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=398.52000000000004s)]
*  And then there were a lot of liberals who were reluctant to rise and criticize the Biden [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=406.44s)]
*  Justice Department. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=411.40000000000003s)]
*  One of the people who actually covered the case at the time and denounced it vehemently [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=412.40000000000003s)]
*  was Glenn Beck. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=417.12s)]
*  But the only person with a corporate media job, a corporate media platform, who covered [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=419.76s)]
*  this case and denounced it was the white nationalist Tucker Carlson. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=426.56s)]
*  I say white nationalist in quotes because it is gospel, in liberal discourse that he [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=431.8s)]
*  is a racist and a white nationalist and yet he is the only one out of all of them willing [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=436.88s)]
*  to rise in defense of the constitutional rights of these black American leftists. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=441.88s)]
*  I went on a show to talk about the case, but he also did his monologues on it and called [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=446.28s)]
*  on his show the leader of this party and had a very amiable conversation with them. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=452.84s)]
*  Here's part of what he said. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=457.6s)]
*  But not anymore. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=459.3s)]
*  According to the indictment, the criminals in question quote, wrote articles that contained [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=461.0s)]
*  Russian propaganda and disinformation. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=465.40000000000003s)]
*  Huh? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=467.84000000000003s)]
*  They also gave speeches and posted videos that annoyed the State Department. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=468.84000000000003s)]
*  Here's one of them. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=474.36s)]
*  There's a discussion about Russian military border buildup on its border with Ukraine [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=475.36s)]
*  and how this represents a terrible threat to Ukraine by Russians. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=482.16s)]
*  But there is no acknowledgement of the history that took us to this place, how the U.S. overthrew [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=488.76s)]
*  participated in facilitating the overthrow of a government in Ukraine that was friendly [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=495.20000000000005s)]
*  to the Soviet Union. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=501.36s)]
*  Nor does it talk about the history of this relationship between Ukraine and Russia. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=502.36s)]
*  This is an ongoing aggression. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=507.92s)]
*  It did not just start. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=509.28000000000003s)]
*  It's been going on for a while, but the U.S. government relies on the ignorance of the [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=510.88000000000005s)]
*  people in this country and much of the world that's facilitated by people like Zuckerberg. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=518.88s)]
*  So, for whatever it's worth, we're not really sure who that guy is. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=525.44s)]
*  We know he's American. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=528.1600000000001s)]
*  Pretty sure that on a lot of issues, we likely would not agree with him. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=529.6800000000001s)]
*  A lot of what he just said in that video seems to be true. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=533.44s)]
*  But even if it weren't true, even if he was wrong, it would still be constitutionally [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=536.32s)]
*  protected speech in a free country, which we had until recently. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=541.52s)]
*  You are allowed by definition to have dumb opinions. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=546.2s)]
*  Most of us do, but not anymore. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=549.08s)]
*  So that man you just saw is facing 10 years behind bars for expressing views about Ukraine [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=552.0s)]
*  that the Biden administration doesn't want to hear. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=557.84s)]
*  That's terrifying. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=561.16s)]
*  Does no one else think that's terrifying? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=562.16s)]
*  It is terrifying. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=563.44s)]
*  And to that man's credit, whoever he is, he saw it coming. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=564.44s)]
*  Here he is at a rally last month. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=567.68s)]
*  They have declared that black people are so stupid that it takes Russians to tell us that [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=569.84s)]
*  we are on press. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=577.88s)]
*  I have never known a moment of black freedom for my entire life. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=578.88s)]
*  I have never read of a moment since the beginning of a colonial model projection where black [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=583.88s)]
*  people have been free. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=589.2s)]
*  And yet they are saying that we are working, we are agents of some foreign power because [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=591.2s)]
*  we say black people must be free. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=597.4s)]
*  Okay, again, we're not defending that guy because we agree with all of his views. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=599.68s)]
*  We probably don't. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=605.28s)]
*  That is totally irrelevant. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=607.04s)]
*  Whether you agree with what someone is saying has nothing to do with his right to say it. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=609.24s)]
*  Americans are allowed to say what they think is true, period. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=614.4399999999999s)]
*  Greenwald is the host of... [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=619.68s)]
*  It is really remarkable that we got to the point where the only person in corporate media, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=621.68s)]
*  on television or in major newspapers, willing to stand in defense of the free speech rights [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=628.9599999999999s)]
*  of a black left-wing anti-war socialist group is Tucker Carlson. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=635.76s)]
*  But that is the society in which we live. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=641.4s)]
*  Neoliberals and Democrats have zero belief in free speech. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=643.56s)]
*  Zero. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=647.4399999999999s)]
*  If you look at the indictment, here it is the indictment, the superseding indictment. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=648.4399999999999s)]
*  It's from January 2nd, 2024. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=655.96s)]
*  You see the... [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=661.12s)]
*  I actually think this is the court ruling, if I'm not mistaken, where the defendants [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=664.08s)]
*  actually filed a motion asking for dismissal of this case on the grounds that everything [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=671.28s)]
*  they're accused of doing is protected by the First Amendment. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=677.2s)]
*  When you file a motion to dismiss before it goes to trial or anything else, you basically [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=680.5600000000001s)]
*  say, we're going to assume for the sake of argument that everything the government alleges [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=684.8s)]
*  that we did is something that we in fact did. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=688.88s)]
*  And the argument was, even if we did everything the government says we did, it still cannot [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=691.1999999999999s)]
*  be a crime because everything we did is protected by the First Amendment. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=698.7199999999999s)]
*  And yet the magistrate judge decided that they would not dismiss this case, meaning [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=702.8s)]
*  it's likely to go to trial, and essentially had an argument about free speech that was [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=708.28s)]
*  beyond belief in terms of what the free speech clause actually permits. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=714.72s)]
*  Here is part of what the court said, quote, by the motion, defendants argue the superseding [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=720.08s)]
*  indictment should be dismissed on First Amendment free speech grounds because the superseding [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=725.6800000000001s)]
*  indictment directly targets political speech and the law with which their charge is unconstitutional [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=729.84s)]
*  as applied. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=736.08s)]
*  Now, the law that they're charged with doesn't say it's illegal to be a foreign agent of [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=737.08s)]
*  the Russian government or any other government. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=743.04s)]
*  It says that if you're acting on behalf of a foreign government, you have to file a disclosure [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=744.4s)]
*  form, the FARA disclosure form, that identifies yourself as being that and that they fail [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=748.9599999999999s)]
*  to do so. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=754.9599999999999s)]
*  Now, this is the kind of law that they almost never invoke against anybody, but they suddenly [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=755.9599999999999s)]
*  decided to do so when they wanted to prosecute people like Paul Manafort. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=762.76s)]
*  This is the kind of law that they dragged out. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=766.24s)]
*  The court goes on, quote, the United States contends that section 951 targets Democrats' [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=771.4000000000001s)]
*  conduct rather than speech and is constitutional as applied under an intermediate scrutiny [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=776.6800000000001s)]
*  standard. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=781.5600000000001s)]
*  On September 28, 2023, this court held a hearing on the matter. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=782.9200000000001s)]
*  Based upon the party's briefs and the overall record, the undersigned finds that defendants' [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=787.6800000000001s)]
*  arguments must fail at this time and therefore recommends that defendants' motion be denied. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=791.08s)]
*  What the court essentially said, and just to hear it, doesn't even pass the lab test, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=795.52s)]
*  is that there was nothing ideological or political about this prosecution. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=802.84s)]
*  In other words, if this had been, say, a standard pro-Biden liberal group that loved Ukraine [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=807.84s)]
*  and flew the Ukraine flag and was highly supportive of the US role in Ukraine and cheered [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=819.28s)]
*  Biden for doing it, but met with Ukrainians and over the course of six years received [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=825.4s)]
*  some trivial sum of money, the court, the Biden Justice Department would have prosecuted [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=832.0799999999999s)]
*  them too. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=836.76s)]
*  And that it's therefore a viewpoint neutral prosecution having nothing to do with the [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=838.48s)]
*  First Amendment. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=842.12s)]
*  Anyone who believes that or who purports to believe that is either incredibly naive or [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=845.36s)]
*  a blatant liar. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=849.16s)]
*  Of course, the reason this prosecution was brought was because these people are dissidents. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=852.2800000000001s)]
*  They're anti-establishment dissidents and they're critics of the Biden administration's [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=856.32s)]
*  foreign policy and its role in Ukraine. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=861.5200000000001s)]
*  And they're getting called Russian agents not because they're incapable of thinking [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=864.44s)]
*  for themselves or forming anti-war ideas without being told by Russian officials what to say [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=869.32s)]
*  and think, which is the rather condescending and insulting premise of this indictment, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=873.9200000000001s)]
*  but instead because the United States government, especially under the Biden administration, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=880.84s)]
*  sees anybody who opposes their policies and their wars, especially the ones pertaining [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=885.4s)]
*  to Ukraine, as being a Russian agent. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=893.1600000000001s)]
*  And because the leader of this party had traveled to Russia, something that's very legal to [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=896.8000000000001s)]
*  do, I've done it twice, and received $7,000 over the course of six years in donations [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=901.6800000000001s)]
*  from people they say were linked to the Russian government and then made statements, political [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=907.06s)]
*  statements of exactly the type you would expect a person like this, given his long history [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=912.9s)]
*  of activism, to say, this is an 81-year-old man who was raided by the FBI with guns pointed [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=917.26s)]
*  at him and his wife in the early morning, even though he obviously poses a threat to [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=925.4599999999999s)]
*  nobody. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=930.7399999999999s)]
*  The type of prosecution this is is very recognizable. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=933.06s)]
*  This is not a new tactic. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=936.46s)]
*  It was done throughout the entire Cold War. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=947.94s)]
*  It culminated and found its most disgraceful expression in the McCarthy era, but it has [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=950.58s)]
*  been completely rejuvenated for different ends and primarily by Democrats and neoliberals. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=954.62s)]
*  So we sat down right before the show live just to accommodate them and their time, and [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=960.3000000000001s)]
*  we spoke with the chairman of this party, Amala Yeshialtele, and his lawyer, Leonard [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=965.14s)]
*  Goodman, who, as I said, is a criminal defense lawyer. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=971.54s)]
*  He's also an adjunct professor of law at DePaul who has taken on the case pro bono because [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=974.58s)]
*  he understands, as Todd Carlson does, the free speech rights that are being attacked [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=980.62s)]
*  for everybody. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=987.3s)]
*  Imagine if the government can win this case and if they can prove that you said things [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=988.3s)]
*  that they believe is pro-Russian propaganda, which means basically everything that criticizes [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=995.1s)]
*  the Democratic Party, or that you intended to do so with the attempt to influence the [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=999.86s)]
*  election, which is every bit the right of an American citizen to do, that they now have [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1006.58s)]
*  a legal foundation to accuse you of being an agent of a foreign power. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1011.94s)]
*  It is hard to overstate the threat that this poses to the free speech rights and First [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1016.78s)]
*  Amendment rights, and even if they ultimately win, they're going to have huge costs. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1021.08s)]
*  Even though their lawyer is acting pro bono to his great credit, there's all kinds of [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1025.32s)]
*  costs of having to get expert witnesses. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1029.44s)]
*  The government intends to bring expert witnesses to testify about how disinformation works. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1031.24s)]
*  You can imagine what kind of people those are going to be. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1035.74s)]
*  So during the interview, and we're going to post at the end of the show as well, how you [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1039.24s)]
*  can contribute to their legal defense fund, which I hope you will. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1043.44s)]
*  It will also be in the description in the video. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1047.08s)]
*  They both give that information, but this is a serious case, even though you might think [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1052.96s)]
*  this is a small party, it's a fringe party, but the case itself is very serious. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1057.56s)]
*  One of the strategies governments use is they purposely bring the case against people who [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1063.12s)]
*  you might feel a little bit uncomfortable by aligning with or defending. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1068.6s)]
*  I actually found him to be incredibly well spoken. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1074.28s)]
*  You get a very clear sense of exactly what he is, of the political movement out of which [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1078.08s)]
*  he emerged in the 1960s. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1082.1200000000001s)]
*  He's very rational. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1085.08s)]
*  He's very thoughtful. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1086.08s)]
*  The idea that he's a puppet being told to oppose the war in Ukraine simply because Russian [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1087.08s)]
*  officials are telling him to is something that I think you'll instinctively realize [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1093.0s)]
*  is not even plausible. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1099.08s)]
*  His lawyer makes a very strong case as well about why this case is incredibly frivolous. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1104.4399999999998s)]
*  Frivolous though it is, it is very dangerous. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1108.8s)]
*  We intend to keep reporting on it. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1111.6399999999999s)]
*  Here's the interview that we conducted just a few moments before we started our live show [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1113.3999999999999s)]
*  both with the chairman of the African People Socialist Party who faces 15 years in prison [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1117.6799999999998s)]
*  and his lawyer Leonard Goodman. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1122.3999999999999s)]
*  Gentlemen, good evening. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1126.6799999999998s)]
*  Thank you so much for taking the time to join us tonight. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1127.6799999999998s)]
*  I think your case is so important and I'm really happy for the opportunity to talk with [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1131.32s)]
*  you about it. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1134.84s)]
*  If you don't mind, let me begin with Chairman Nyeshetala because I want to understand a [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1136.84s)]
*  little bit or I want the audience to understand a little bit more about the African People [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1141.72s)]
*  Socialist Party which is at the heart of this prosecution. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1146.8s)]
*  It's an organization of which you're the chairman. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1149.72s)]
*  You've been at it for a long time. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1152.12s)]
*  Just tell us a little bit about the history of the party. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1154.32s)]
*  When was it formed and in what ideology or for what reasons was the party created? [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1157.56s)]
*  Well, the party was formed formally in 1972 but I was a member of the Student Nonviolent [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1162.56s)]
*  Coordinating Committee, SNCC, that made a significant move within the civil rights movement [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1171.56s)]
*  within 1966 to call for black power. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1180.24s)]
*  This was a major change in development in the civil rights movement itself where one [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1184.28s)]
*  trend of our movement, which is historical, has been there all along, moved toward actual [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1191.32s)]
*  accomplishing self-determination as opposed to simply trying to integrate into American [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1200.6399999999999s)]
*  society and based on the struggle to be able to have self-reliance, feed clothes, house [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1207.36s)]
*  ourselves, just be a self-reliant people. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1216.32s)]
*  So in 1972, after many years of involvement first with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1220.0s)]
*  Committee, I spent time in prison in St. Petersburg, Florida for having removed a horrible offensive [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1225.6399999999999s)]
*  mural that was on the city hall wall, an 8 by 10 foot mural there that depicted African [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1236.32s)]
*  people in grotesque caricature. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1243.24s)]
*  And after pleading with the mayor for a while, I led a demonstration in city hall that resulted [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1245.6799999999998s)]
*  ultimately in our taking the mural down from the wall and was sentenced to five years in [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1251.48s)]
*  prison for that act after having been charged with 11 different offenses. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1259.8s)]
*  Spent time in prison as a consequence of that, in and out of prison for a while. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1265.9199999999998s)]
*  Got out of prison on bond, actually four days before the assassination of Martin Luther King. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1272.1599999999999s)]
*  I participated in a demonstration in Gainesville, Florida. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1281.9199999999998s)]
*  And on my way to Florida on the Greyhound bus, I arrived and learned that King had been killed. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1286.4799999999998s)]
*  The demonstration I was going there to attend was to help defend some young African men, [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1294.4s)]
*  black men, who had been in prison there. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1302.3200000000002s)]
*  And when I got there, King, learned King had been killed and the demonstration, [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1307.1200000000001s)]
*  the character of the demonstration changed, revolving around his assassination. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1312.48s)]
*  I was arrested there, one of the first persons, one of the first two persons who was arrested on [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1316.96s)]
*  a law that had just been created called inciting to riot that did not require a riot to occur. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1323.2s)]
*  It was a thought crime in that it required me to have wanted a riot to occur after having made a [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1332.16s)]
*  speech. So I spent some time in jail through that. And in the process of all of this, [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1338.0800000000002s)]
*  we concluded after a period that it was not good enough just to be involved in protest, [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1346.88s)]
*  that we had to be able to build a movement that was about achieving power of our lives [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1352.48s)]
*  and determined that the best vehicle for doing that was the political party. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1359.28s)]
*  That was the basis for the founding of the African People's Socialist Party. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1364.8s)]
*  And at some juncture, during this work, we also concluded that the struggle of black people in [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1369.1200000000001s)]
*  this country was part of a much broader struggle of black people around the world, that it began [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1376.56s)]
*  when we were first introduced into this country, that is to say black people at gunpoint. And so we [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1382.08s)]
*  began a movement to connect the struggle of Africans here with Africans everywhere [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1390.96s)]
*  and with the struggle of colonized peoples around the world. And so that's kind of sort of, [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1395.76s)]
*  you know, the history and motivation of the African People's Socialist Party and of me. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1402.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so I mean, that last point that you made is a crucial part of really why I asked what I think [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1407.52s)]
*  connects so much to this case. Typically on Martin Luther King Day, what has become this federal [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1413.68s)]
*  holiday, I often feature what for me was, I think, one of his most interesting speeches given in [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1419.28s)]
*  Harlem exactly a year to the date before he was killed in 1967, where he explained why he had come [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1426.16s)]
*  to the conclusion that domestic activism on racism and racial equality was insufficient. Why? [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1432.48s)]
*  Similar to what you just said, it was inextricably linked to questions of US foreign policy, US [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1437.76s)]
*  behavior in the world, in particular in that moment. For him, that meant opposition to the war in [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1443.52s)]
*  Vietnam. It was something where he kind of expanded his focus to the consternation of a lot of liberals [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1448.48s)]
*  at the time, where he began focusing on anti-war activism. And of course, in the 60s and the 70s, [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1454.8s)]
*  anti-war activism was often linked with the American left, although there were parts of the [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1460.16s)]
*  American right that were more isolationist, but largely it was viewed as a left-wing cause. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1464.8000000000002s)]
*  Interestingly, at least when it comes to certain wars like the NATO-US war in Ukraine against Russia, [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1469.52s)]
*  opposition to that war has now gotten cast as almost a right-wing cause, which is very bizarre [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1475.92s)]
*  to me. I presume it's pretty bizarre to you too, having been at this for even longer. And in cases [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1482.0s)]
*  like the one that you're currently involved in, where the question is, is somebody acting as an [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1488.64s)]
*  agent of a foreign government? Typically, when I think of someone who's acting as an agent of a [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1493.44s)]
*  foreign government, that to me is somebody who's like a lobbyist, somebody who's saying things that [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1497.5200000000002s)]
*  they don't believe because they're being paid to say them or to work on behalf of a foreign government. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1502.5600000000002s)]
*  In this case, in the case of your advocacy against US involvement in Ukraine or even your advocacy, [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1507.6000000000001s)]
*  where you end up siding on the side of Russia in certain controversies, do you see that as [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1514.24s)]
*  consistent with the activism and ideology that you've been pursuing and defending for decades? [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1521.76s)]
*  It's very much consistent with it. The fact is that it's very disingenuous for the United [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1528.56s)]
*  States government to charge us of not having agency, that we are working on behalf of a foreign [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1536.08s)]
*  government. The fact is that I was in Belfast, Ireland in 1983 and working in solidarity with [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1542.4s)]
*  the Irish people in opposition to British colonialism. I was in Nicaragua at the time of [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1553.44s)]
*  the Reagan inauguration in opposition to US in solidarity with the people of Nicaragua who had [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1562.96s)]
*  just won their freedom despite the policies of the United States government. In fact, it was a [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1570.16s)]
*  time of extreme turmoil that even changed some policies of the United States government in terms [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1577.6000000000001s)]
*  of how I would characterize people like me who were talking about freedom and had determined that [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1583.2s)]
*  people who were engaged in struggles like in Nicaragua and El Salvador that had emerged [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1590.96s)]
*  would no longer be tolerated in terms of calling them freedom fighters, they would be characterized [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1597.6s)]
*  as terrorists. I was in Spain, invited to speak in Spain by an NGO that was supported by the [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1602.48s)]
*  Spanish government. I was there in 2007 and when I spoke there, I spoke also in opposition to US [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1610.7199999999998s)]
*  policies that were impacting on people around the world. I was invited to speak at Oxford Union [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1617.6s)]
*  and I spoke there in 2019 and I opened my presentation in 2019 expressing solidarity [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1623.76s)]
*  with the government of Venezuela that at the time was being challenged by United States policy as [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1632.32s)]
*  well. So this is historically what we've been about and so this whole notion that somehow [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1639.36s)]
*  we become an employee of Russia because I visited Moscow and got marching orders [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1645.44s)]
*  from Moscow at that point that's been responsible for the fact that we ran and participated in [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1655.76s)]
*  elections, not gun battles but elections, participated in elections in St. Petersburg, [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1663.04s)]
*  Florida for mayor, for city council, 2017, 2019, we ran candidates on reparations and [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1668.72s)]
*  things like that that suddenly we are learning is a consequence of a relationship to Russia and not [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1676.56s)]
*  due to the agency of black people. And even the whole nonsense about Russia hiring us to talk [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1682.96s)]
*  about genocide, I mean we held a convention, a tribunal on reparations for black people [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1690.16s)]
*  in the United States in 1982 in New York City and use international laws as a basis for that [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1697.84s)]
*  and one of those laws was the UN convention on the punishment and on the prevention and [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1704.48s)]
*  punishment of the crime of genocide. So it's disingenuous. There's nothing that we're doing [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1711.28s)]
*  now that we haven't been doing for the last 50 years. Yeah I mean it's so bizarre you know [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1715.6799999999998s)]
*  you can go back decades of course of the Cold War and it found its most disgraceful expression [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1720.6399999999999s)]
*  in the McCarthy era where the US government, the US security state would routinely accuse American [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1725.36s)]
*  citizens who descended from the policies, the war policies of the US government of being in somehow [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1729.92s)]
*  in cahoots with the Kremlin or disloyal or an agent of the Kremlin and it's really bizarre to [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1735.12s)]
*  watch that be rejuvenated even after the ideology of Russia has changed so radically albeit often by [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1740.8s)]
*  the Democratic Party, the kind of neoliberal order just this week we saw a suggestion from Nancy Pelosi [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1747.76s)]
*  that anti-Israel or pro-Palestinian protesters might be somehow connected to the Kremlin and [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1753.12s)]
*  they ought to be investigated this kind of paranoia that we hadn't seen for decades. Before I get to [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1758.9599999999998s)]
*  your counsel Mr. Goodman talk about a couple of the technical aspects of your case and where it is [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1764.0s)]
*  I just want to ask you one last question which is or for now I mean which is I have seen videos of [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1768.8799999999999s)]
*  you speaking before your arrest before this indictment where you seemed to be almost anticipating [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1773.84s)]
*  that there would be accusations of this kind launched at you or that there would be some kind [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1782.4s)]
*  of case brought against you. Is that a correct perception and did this indictment come as a big [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1786.88s)]
*  surprise to you to hear that you were actually being criminally accused by the Biden Justice [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1793.8400000000001s)]
*  Department of being agents of the Russian government? It was surprising in in terms of [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1798.0800000000002s)]
*  when it happened and how it happened because it was a very violent attack on my home, threatened [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1805.44s)]
*  my life, threatened the life of my wife. A tremendous amount of resources were stolen, [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1811.12s)]
*  properties damaged and things like that and it was a pre-dawn raid and so we were surprised by that [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1816.2399999999998s)]
*  but the history of our struggle I mean they raided my home at five o'clock a.m. but when I [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1822.0s)]
*  came at their command out of my house and with my hands up as they commanded and faced armored [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1830.56s)]
*  vehicles and assault weapons carrying camouflage donned men who were pointing [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1839.68s)]
*  these weapons and with the laser targeting devices bouncing off my chest what came to my mind was [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1849.3600000000001s)]
*  1969 when in December when the FBI raided the home of or they assisted the attack on the home [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1857.2s)]
*  of Fred Hampton in Chicago where he was assassinated and so I thought I was going to die when I walked [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1866.16s)]
*  out of that house so and my point being is that the treatment of people like me who [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1873.8400000000001s)]
*  moved from a particular policy that has prevailed for a long time in this country especially since [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1884.5600000000002s)]
*  people like King and Malcolm X and Fred Hampton and others have been assassinated [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1892.5600000000002s)]
*  there is that history and there is that tradition so I'm not surprised that the U.S. government [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1899.2s)]
*  attacked me. We have an incredible program where we've done incredible projects particularly in [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1903.52s)]
*  the city of St. Louis where I mean actual redeveloped much of the north side of St. Louis [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1909.28s)]
*  which is a predominantly African community that's been left to deteriorate and not just deteriorate [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1916.64s)]
*  a policy that they characterize as benign neglect has been imposed on this community and so [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1922.24s)]
*  this is the work that we've been doing and we knew that it wasn't something that the [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1928.96s)]
*  government was happy with but that the population the community was happy with so I'm not [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1934.4s)]
*  I'm not surprised and we expect I guess to be attacked by the government but not because we [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1938.96s)]
*  violated the crime and this is the thing that makes this extraordinarily interesting to us [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1944.4s)]
*  is that we find ourselves in a position of having to fight in defense of a U.S. constitution and [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1949.52s)]
*  the right to free speech against the very government that says it's about free speech [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1955.84s)]
*  and that's upholding the constitution and against the institutions like FBI and the presidency of [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1959.84s)]
*  this country that's supposed to be upholding the constitution I think they even have to take [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1965.92s)]
*  vows to that effect and so here we are as an organization that has come to the conclusion [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1969.6s)]
*  some time ago that we have to be free from the colonial domination of the United States [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1975.52s)]
*  government are in a position fighting fiercely and have fought fiercely for the rights of free [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1980.8s)]
*  speech as according to the constitution freedom of assembly according to the constitution and that [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1986.72s)]
*  kind of thing so no yes I'm not I'm not shocked by the attack as I said the way the attack occurred [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=1991.76s)]
*  on this occasion was shocking unexpected and pre-dawn my wife and I sitting up at the table [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=2001.36s)]
*  she and her being prepared to come to our headquarters here in St. Louis to preside over [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=2007.9199999999998s)]
*  a program that we are training black women as duelists to be able to help women and children [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=2015.4399999999998s)]
*  have safe births in a city that has a situation where enough black babies die every year to feel [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=2023.36s)]
*  15 kindergarten classes and this is what we were preparing we were talking about this when this [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=2030.24s)]
*  this this noise came out out of the dark telling us to come up with our hands up and flash bang [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=2035.76s)]
*  grenades exploding all around ultimately coming into the house and things like that and then to [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=2042.16s)]
*  be confronted with this armed force out there that was that was a surprise so yeah I don't blame you [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=2047.28s)]
*  I think that you know a lot of people don't understand the amount of force that the federal [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=2054.0s)]
*  government brings without the slightest consideration of whether or not there's any actual [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=2060.16s)]
*  threat posed this is not a case even if you want to believe all the allegations involving any [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=2065.28s)]
*  accusation of violence or any kind of use of force it's clearly a political case at its core [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=2070.0s)]
*  at best a kind of argument that you violated technical parts of the law by failing to register [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=2076.64s)]
*  as a foreign agent to treat American citizens that way is I think something that people don't [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqe6Kb1E5iU&t=2082.48s)]
