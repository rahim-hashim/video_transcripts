# Rep. Warren Davidson on Militarism and Surveillance
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [April 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M)
*  Congressman Davidson, it is great to see you. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you so much for taking the time to talk to us tonight. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=8.48s)]
*  Yeah, definitely an honor to join you. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  Thanks for talking. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=13.16s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=14.16s)]
*  So I'd like to begin with a conversation about the somewhat unusual vote that took place [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=15.16s)]
*  in the House earlier today, where 19 Republican members of the House defected from Speaker [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=21.96s)]
*  Johnson's position on the rules vote, something that you don't see very often, and blocked [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=29.279999999999998s)]
*  a House floor vote on renewal of the FISA spying bill that would allow renewal with [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=34.92s)]
*  essentially no reforms. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=40.519999999999996s)]
*  From my understanding, you are a critic of the FISA bill, a believer that there needs [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=43.12s)]
*  to be additional safeguards to protect Americans' privacy rights, and yet you are not one of [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=46.599999999999994s)]
*  the 19 Republicans who voted no on bringing this bill to the floor. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  Why weren't you? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=55.84s)]
*  Well, I agreed not to work against the rule. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=58.519999999999996s)]
*  I'm the lead sponsor on the Fourth Amendment's Not For Sale Act, which would close the data [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=60.64s)]
*  broker loophole. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=65.88s)]
*  When we moved that bill through Judiciary Committee last summer, it passed 36 to 1 through [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=68.84s)]
*  committee, and because of that it was incorporated into the FISA reauthorization that went through [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=75.56s)]
*  Judiciary Committee, and that passed Judiciary 35 to 2. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=80.64s)]
*  So, virtually never do you see like Jim Jordan and Jerry Nadler, but they agree, we should [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=86.08000000000001s)]
*  get a warrant, we should close the data broker loophole, we should have some other reforms, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=90.64s)]
*  and unfortunately that whole process was scuttled. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=96.2s)]
*  But the long story as to how we wind up with a bill that completely guts all the reforms [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=98.12s)]
*  that went through Judiciary, and that's why, frankly, a lot of people worked to take down [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=105.52000000000001s)]
*  the rule. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=110.56s)]
*  So, I'm still trying to guarantee that we get a vote on this provision of Fourth Amendment's [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=111.56s)]
*  Not For Sale, and part of my agreement was to keep this alive, is I will not work against [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=115.48s)]
*  the rule. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=121.36s)]
*  Now, on the other hand, I didn't say I would work for the rule, and so I didn't do anything [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=122.36s)]
*  to try to help save it. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=126.44s)]
*  I didn't vote for it or against it. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=127.64s)]
*  But if the bill, and my understanding is Speaker Johnson had reached an agreement with the [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=131.12s)]
*  two committees, the Intelligence Committee and the Judiciary Committee, to allow three [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=135.92000000000002s)]
*  different votes on particular amendments, including the one that you mentioned, only [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=140.28s)]
*  to then try to bring a bill to the floor that would have allowed renewal with no reforms [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=144.92000000000002s)]
*  of any kind. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=149.76s)]
*  If that bill had been brought to the floor, if Speaker Johnson had been able to do that [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=150.76s)]
*  with the unanimity that we usually see from the entire Republican caucus, do you think [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=155.68s)]
*  there was a chance that that bill with no safeguards for American citizens and our privacy [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=160.92000000000002s)]
*  rights could have passed the House? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=166.6s)]
*  Well, let me correct the premise. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=168.4s)]
*  So the bill that was the base text does have some reform in it, and I will say it's a little [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=172.04s)]
*  more than it was before. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=177.67999999999998s)]
*  It does have some things that are substantive in it. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=178.68s)]
*  There's 56 reforms, but about, I think, 47 of the 56 reforms came from the Intel Committee. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=182.51999999999998s)]
*  So they're palatable for the intelligence community. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=190.0s)]
*  They're not something that's going to be draconian. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=192.95999999999998s)]
*  In fact, there's some concern that the provisions in the Intel Committee asked for would actually [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=196.6s)]
*  could be used against whistleblowers instead of used against the people that are violating [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=203.28s)]
*  our right. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=207.96s)]
*  So there's concern with the base text. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=208.96s)]
*  But to say that it has no reform is wrong. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=210.68s)]
*  And there were six amendments that were made in order. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=214.24s)]
*  So we were going to vote on a bill that would have given us a chance to vote to add in a [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=217.44s)]
*  warrant requirement to close the about selection, to increase the reporting requirements. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=222.48s)]
*  Those were the judiciary reforms. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=230.48s)]
*  And then there were three Intel Committee amendments that were made in order. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=233.72s)]
*  One would expand surveillance to collect information from Wi-Fi hotspots. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=237.16s)]
*  It would essentially nullify the Fourth Amendment if somebody's having a conversation about [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=243.84s)]
*  drug trafficking. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=248.78s)]
*  And then it would collect information about new entrants into the country, which probably [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=250.98s)]
*  would have passed because of the problem of having with illegal immigration. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=255.46s)]
*  So those are the six amendments that were made in order. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=259.22s)]
*  And so the people that voted against it said, we don't like the way it's framed. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=263.14s)]
*  You're not making an order of things that shorten the duration of the authorization. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=267.54s)]
*  last during the next Trump administration, for example, this version that was coming [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=273.06s)]
*  to the floor would have had a five-year authorization. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=280.06s)]
*  That could have been completely outside of a second term for President Trump's ability [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=283.06s)]
*  to influence how we get ahead. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=287.94s)]
*  And it gutted the Fourth Amendment's time to bail and pulled it outside. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=291.34000000000003s)]
*  Couldn't even get a vote on that. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=295.62s)]
*  So those are the main reasons that people voted against the rule. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=297.18s)]
*  Oh, right, exactly. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=301.53999999999996s)]
*  And I didn't say there were no changes. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=302.53999999999996s)]
*  There definitely were some. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=304.7s)]
*  But as you said, they were the ones that the Intelligence Committee was happy about, which [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=305.7s)]
*  I think is indicative of the fact that they don't really impose meaningful limits. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=308.9s)]
*  And some privacy groups actually have said, for reasons you actually alluded to, that [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=313.41999999999996s)]
*  in some senses it might actually weaken protections even further or strengthen their power to [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=318.26s)]
*  spy on Americans. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=323.21999999999997s)]
*  Let me ask you, the reform that you are advocating, the Fourth Amendment is not for sale amendment, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=324.54s)]
*  is one that deals with this program where the security state can buy data on American [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=334.22s)]
*  citizens on the open market that they would be constitutionally prohibited from collecting. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=338.94000000000005s)]
*  Can you talk about why you think that reform is so important and what other reforms would [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=343.66s)]
*  you require before you're ready to vote for renewal? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=349.38000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, so the warrant requirement on a different provision, not 702, but a different provision, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=353.5s)]
*  they did abuse a warrant when Carter Page was doing the Russia Gate, the Russian Inclusion [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=360.54s)]
*  stuff, all that stuff that was used against Donald Trump's campaign. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=366.74s)]
*  So the warrant itself isn't a complete sales state. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=371.3s)]
*  But even when you do get a warrant requirement added, I think a lot of people are saying, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=374.38s)]
*  well, even if the warrant amendment passes, we can always bypass it. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=379.5s)]
*  Because the data brokers are collecting so much intelligence on average citizens today. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=384.42s)]
*  And if they're not already collecting it because of what's known as third party doctrine, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=389.54s)]
*  this is the idea that once you've shared your information with someone else, then you no [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=394.98s)]
*  longer are supposed to have an expectation of privacy. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=398.82s)]
*  Never mind that to be able to open a bank account, you had to share the information, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=401.94s)]
*  or to have a cell phone, you had to share the information and so on and whatnot. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=405.5s)]
*  So in any account based relationship you've got, the government essentially says, share [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=409.02s)]
*  with us what you're collecting. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=414.02s)]
*  And if you're not already collecting information, we'll pay you money to add to the things that [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=416.53999999999996s)]
*  you're collecting, and then you can share it with us. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=420.65999999999997s)]
*  And so they create an entire market for what these data brokers collect and how it moves. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=423.58s)]
*  And people say, well, if insurance companies are buying this data to underwrite insurance [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=428.7s)]
*  policies, why are you okay with that? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=435.14s)]
*  Well, I'm not. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=437.66s)]
*  But the insurance companies aren't going to be able to put you in jail. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=439.02000000000004s)]
*  They're not going to be able to present evidence in court and you not be able to get access [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=441.42s)]
*  to exculpatory evidence. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=445.14000000000004s)]
*  So those are the kinds of abuses that are going on in cases right now in America without [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=447.06s)]
*  this reform, and we need to close that loophole. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=452.22s)]
*  So in the event that the final bill that gets voted on by the House does not include that [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=455.14000000000004s)]
*  reform that you just described or some version of it, and I hope it will for sure, but I [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=461.94000000000005s)]
*  hope other reforms are there too. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=467.46000000000004s)]
*  But in the event that the final bill does not have that protection that you just described, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=468.46000000000004s)]
*  would you prefer that the FISA authority lapse or would you be willing to vote for its renewal [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=473.62s)]
*  even without those protections? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=480.18s)]
*  Well, I think two things that I want in the bill for sure. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=482.22s)]
*  Get a warrant and don't bypass getting a warrant with the data broker loophole. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=485.98s)]
*  And if those two things pass, then I'm for the bill. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=491.06s)]
*  But the reality is the speaker's alternative. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=494.22s)]
*  He's talking about bringing a bill that just reauthorizes the program status quo on the [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=496.14s)]
*  one hand or on the other, reauthorizes the base text of the bill without considering [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=500.3s)]
*  any of the amendments. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=505.97999999999996s)]
*  I think either of those would be a complete disaster. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=507.34s)]
*  I'm completely opposed to that version. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=509.62s)]
*  And frankly, it shortchanges the ability to get future reforms. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=512.3s)]
*  And there is progress on alternatives in the Senate. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=517.8199999999999s)]
*  So there might be a case to just let the Senate move first. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=520.62s)]
*  And then lastly, if it does expire, it's not like the government's going to stop collecting [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=523.3399999999999s)]
*  this intelligence. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=527.06s)]
*  Four years ago, I was having a debate with Liz Cheney. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=528.9399999999999s)]
*  Mike Turner's now the Liz Cheney of this fight in this cycle that wants to keep spying on [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=532.38s)]
*  Americans and the business records provision was up for reauthorization. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=538.06s)]
*  So when they did the Patriot Act, they didn't just let the whole thing lapse after a period [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=542.2199999999999s)]
*  of time. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=546.5s)]
*  They've got layer after layer of these expiration dates. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=547.5s)]
*  So it's really hard to dismantle the whole system. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=551.86s)]
*  But in 2020, we got the business records provision to expire. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=554.6600000000001s)]
*  They said it's going to be a disaster if this happens. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=559.86s)]
*  I met with Bill Barr and he goes, well, look, FISA is a limitation on our ability to do [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=561.74s)]
*  surveillance. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=566.38s)]
*  It simply says how we do the surveillance. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=567.38s)]
*  Once this lapses, we're going to keep collecting the information. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=569.2600000000001s)]
*  And that's what they do. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=573.58s)]
*  This is one of the problems with Executive Order 12333 or 12333. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=574.58s)]
*  The government collects all kinds of information and there's very little accountability for [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=579.94s)]
*  them on it. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=584.22s)]
*  And a truly robust reform would say that the only mechanism to collect this kind of information [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=585.22s)]
*  is FISA and we would nullify Executive Order 12333. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=591.34s)]
*  Neither committee touched that and that would have been desirable for me. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=596.7800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=600.3000000000001s)]
*  And it's amazing that the FISA authority, the one the FISA bill enacted in 2008, barely [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=601.3000000000001s)]
*  provides any limits on the FBI's abilities by the NSA's and yet there's constantly a [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=608.02s)]
*  mountain of evidence that they can't even abide by those minimal limits they are abusing [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=613.62s)]
*  their authorities in all sorts of ways. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=618.62s)]
*  And it's kind of shocking that there are members of Congress who just want to renew that law [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=620.82s)]
*  even in the face of those abuses without safeguards. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=624.76s)]
*  But let me ask you, just a couple of months before Speaker Johnson became Speaker when [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=627.74s)]
*  he was a member of Congress, we had him on our show. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=632.62s)]
*  And the two topics we discussed primarily were the abuses of power by the US security [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=635.22s)]
*  state, the FBI, the CIA, the NSA. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=640.38s)]
*  It was the day that the FBI director had appeared to testify in the war in Ukraine. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=642.7s)]
*  And Speaker Johnson was adamant on both that we can't have the renewal of spying powers [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=647.3000000000001s)]
*  of the US security state without major reforms because they're abusing their power and we [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=653.3000000000001s)]
*  cannot continue to finance the war in Ukraine because it's a futile effort. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=657.4200000000001s)]
*  We should spend that money here at home. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=661.5s)]
*  Suddenly, after he becomes Speaker, he now attempts to bring to the floor a bill that [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=664.2199999999999s)]
*  would renew FISA without the warrants. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=669.4599999999999s)]
*  He told me and many other people the reforms were absolutely necessary and is also working [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=671.8199999999999s)]
*  to get another $60 billion to the war in Ukraine. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=676.5799999999999s)]
*  I don't want to ask you to speculate on his motives, but you are somebody who is his colleague, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=681.02s)]
*  who works with him. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=685.3399999999999s)]
*  Can you shed any insight at all into what accounts for these changes? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=687.02s)]
*  Yeah, I think one of the funny headlines I saw in here, but it's somewhat accurate, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=692.5s)]
*  Congressman Mike Johnson disapproves of Speaker Johnson. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=696.5400000000001s)]
*  Mike Johnson's positions on these things were pretty good. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=700.94s)]
*  And frankly, that's part of why he rounded up the votes to become the Speaker. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=703.94s)]
*  And so it's really frustrating to see somebody who's been a champion for getting a warrant, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=708.5400000000001s)]
*  been a champion for... [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=713.86s)]
*  I mean, just in July, he voted for both of these bills. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=714.86s)]
*  And he voted for the Fourth Amendment is not for sale in July. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=719.3000000000001s)]
*  And in the fall, just before becoming Speaker, he votes for the FISA reform effort in Judiciary [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=722.5s)]
*  Committee. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=727.74s)]
*  So it is disappointing. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=728.74s)]
*  And he hasn't yet brought the Ukraine bill to the floor. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=731.1800000000001s)]
*  I don't think there's a plan to bring the exact version that the Senate brought up. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=734.82s)]
*  We're not clear on what exactly the plan is. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=738.6600000000001s)]
*  But I think the real risk for him is if he brings up something like a supplemental omnibus [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=740.9000000000001s)]
*  that's got funding for Ukraine, funding for Israel, funding for Taiwan, and no funding [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=746.58s)]
*  to defend America, no policy changes by the administration that are forced, I think there's [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=752.42s)]
*  a real risk that someone brings up a motion to vacate and it may well work. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=759.9s)]
*  So I want to get into the substance of Ukraine in just a second. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=764.86s)]
*  But before I do, I just want to ask you about that. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=767.82s)]
*  Because there are a lot of reports that have said that the House Democratic Minority Leader, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=770.38s)]
*  Hakeem Jeffries, and many other House Democrats have essentially promised Mike Johnson that [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=776.86s)]
*  if there's an attempt to depose him as Speaker over a new aid package to Ukraine, that the [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=782.5400000000001s)]
*  Democrats would protect him, that they would actually give him the votes he needs to remain [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=787.94s)]
*  as Speaker, even if some in the Republican caucus abandon him. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=792.5s)]
*  How seriously do you take that as a kind of seduction or inducement for him to get this [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=796.58s)]
*  Ukraine aid package passed? [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=803.82s)]
*  Well, they really do want the Ukraine funding. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=805.62s)]
*  I don't know any policy that the Democrats want more than Ukraine funding. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=808.22s)]
*  Because everything else they're doing by executive order, all the policy changes, the open border, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=813.9000000000001s)]
*  all these agenda things, all the executive orders along with the rulemaking of the executive [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=820.5400000000001s)]
*  agencies are out of control. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=826.14s)]
*  And how many times has Joe Biden ignored even the United States Supreme Court to try to [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=828.3s)]
*  forgive student debt? [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=834.22s)]
*  They're running afoul of every check and balance we've got in the government, but they don't [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=835.74s)]
*  have access to the checkbook. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=840.58s)]
*  So they want just shut up and cut the checks to happen. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=842.46s)]
*  And they'll be happy to use Mike Johnson as long as he'll go along with that scheme. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=846.6999999999999s)]
*  And why wouldn't they? [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=850.58s)]
*  He's facilitated everything they've wanted so far. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=851.62s)]
*  So having said that, I think they made Kevin McCarthy feel like they might have him covered [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=855.1s)]
*  if there was a floor vote as well, and they didn't deliver those votes. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=861.82s)]
*  So we'll see if it's brought up. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=865.26s)]
*  My hope is that it isn't, because I do think there's a way for the speaker to address these [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=867.94s)]
*  issues without triggering a motion to vacate. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=871.5s)]
*  And it really is to find his footing and actually lead on these issues versus being led around [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=875.82s)]
*  by the police state, national security state, whatever. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=880.34s)]
*  The same people, frankly, that Dwight Eisenhower cautioned us against in his farewell address. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=884.3s)]
*  I really think it's one of the things that sours people on the political class of Washington. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=890.06s)]
*  I mean, I remember walking away from the interview with Congressman Johnson, very impressed with [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=893.4599999999999s)]
*  his intellect, with his commitment to these principles. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=897.5799999999999s)]
*  He was so passionate about these views. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=900.9399999999999s)]
*  And then he becomes House Speaker, as you said, in part based on these views, and then [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=904.54s)]
*  very quickly starts seemingly working with Democrats against the very views that he's [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=908.74s)]
*  so passionately advocated. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=914.54s)]
*  I think a lot of people get very frustrated in watching something like this. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=915.98s)]
*  Let me ask you, I interviewed Senator Johnson, Ron Johnson this week, who's an opponent of [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=920.74s)]
*  more aid to Ukraine, at least without meaningful improvements in our own border security. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=925.86s)]
*  And yet in 2022, when Congress was first asked to vote on this gigantic $40 billion package, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=931.9s)]
*  he voted yes and has subsequently changed his mind and now opposes it. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=938.18s)]
*  And we explored the reasons why. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=942.5s)]
*  You were somebody who actually opposed aid to Ukraine from the very beginning. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=943.78s)]
*  You voted no. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=947.8599999999999s)]
*  You were one of 57 Republicans in Congress on that first $40 billion bill. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=948.8599999999999s)]
*  Why were you back in May of 2022, just a couple months after the Russian invasion, opposed [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=954.12s)]
*  to USAID to Ukraine? [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=959.54s)]
*  Well, the bill that I've got kind of explains it, the Define the Mission Act. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=962.74s)]
*  And, you know, they never defined a mission. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=967.02s)]
*  So before I can tell you what resources you need, I need to know what you're trying to [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=970.26s)]
*  accomplish. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=976.0600000000001s)]
*  And if you ask the administration, they say something that sort of passes for the average [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=977.0600000000001s)]
*  person as a mission, but it's completely vacuous. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=981.62s)]
*  It says, as much as it takes, as long as it takes. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=984.58s)]
*  Well, to do what? [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=987.1800000000001s)]
*  They don't ever really truly define that. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=988.66s)]
*  When I searched for this term, we found that in 2004, when they were trying to shift from [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=991.62s)]
*  the Find Bin Laden phase in Afghanistan to the nation building phase in Afghanistan, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=995.8199999999999s)]
*  they came up with a phrase, as much as it takes, as long as it takes. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1001.6999999999999s)]
*  And that's how you wander around over there with no defined mission and just an open checkbook [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1005.8199999999999s)]
*  and no real good outcome. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1011.14s)]
*  If you could see how that outcome turned out, it didn't turn out well. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1012.68s)]
*  And so I started saying, you know, tell me what the mission is, and then let me have [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1015.9599999999999s)]
*  the tools to provide accountability. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1020.1s)]
*  And people shouldn't be deceived. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1021.98s)]
*  No matter how much we give them, Ukraine does not have the combat power of their own accord [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1024.14s)]
*  without no other military getting involved directly in the fight, on the ground and in [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1030.1s)]
*  the air and on the sea to extract the Russians from Ukraine. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1036.1s)]
*  So it's true that Ukraine would like to extract the Russians from Ukraine, and they're happy [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1041.7s)]
*  to do that. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1046.94s)]
*  And for some, you know, old Cold Warriors like me, they were willing to go along with [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1047.94s)]
*  it as long as once you said kill Russians, they were like, yeah, count me in. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1053.6200000000001s)]
*  But I can't say it's truly a just war when you're completely annihilating the country [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1057.9s)]
*  of Ukraine with a sort of false hope that somehow they have the means to extract Russia [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1063.78s)]
*  from Ukraine. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1069.48s)]
*  This is what I'd like to understand. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1070.48s)]
*  Maybe you can help me understand this a little bit better. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1073.54s)]
*  I can almost understand and forget that back in May 2022, there was all this optimism about [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1075.78s)]
*  the feisty and courageous Ukrainians, and they were actually quite courageous in standing [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1082.6599999999999s)]
*  up to this much bigger army and keeping them out of Kiev. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1086.6599999999999s)]
*  Maybe there was a sense, a kind of delusion that Ukraine could actually win the war. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1091.1799999999998s)]
*  Here we are though now, you know, two years later, and the only changes to the front line [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1095.2399999999998s)]
*  in the last 18 months were some modest Russian gains, almost no Ukrainian gains. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1100.46s)]
*  The Ukrainians are basically out of artillery. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1105.3s)]
*  They're running out of people just to send to the front lines, whereas the much larger [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1107.58s)]
*  Russia obviously has a lot more people to send. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1111.3s)]
*  It's basically impossible, I think everyone agrees, that the Ukrainians could win by the [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1113.6200000000001s)]
*  definition that NATO and the US set for victory, which was expelling Russia from every inch [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1119.3s)]
*  of Ukrainian territory, not just in eastern Ukraine, but also in Crimea. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1124.16s)]
*  So if I know that, and you know that, I presume that's what the intelligence agencies understand, [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1128.36s)]
*  that's what people in Washington understand. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1135.32s)]
*  What is then the motive for wanting to continue to pour massive amounts of American resources [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1137.9199999999998s)]
*  into a war that Ukraine can't win? [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1144.6399999999999s)]
*  Well, look, the absolutist will tell you that all of Western civilization hangs on this [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1147.28s)]
*  idea of a rules-based order. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1152.6799999999998s)]
*  And post-World War II, no country can invade any other country, and we have to protect [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1154.96s)]
*  the territorial integrity of Ukraine. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1159.48s)]
*  And if you truly believe that this is an existential threat somehow, not just to United States [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1162.56s)]
*  security, but to the security of planet Earth, which some of my colleagues do believe, then [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1166.8400000000001s)]
*  you don't just want Ukraine fighting, you want the US Army defending Kiev, you want [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1173.56s)]
*  the US Navy defending Odessa and the port at the mouth of the Geneva River, and you want [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1178.72s)]
*  the United States Air Force holding all of the ground against it. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1183.9199999999998s)]
*  You want to use all of the combat power of NATO to extract Russia. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1187.8799999999999s)]
*  And if you look at what Blinken's saying and Jens Stoltenberg, who's the secretary general [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1192.08s)]
*  of NATO, they're saying that Ukraine will be a member of NATO. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1196.52s)]
*  And let's go back into how this started. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1201.5s)]
*  I mean, this is really a continuation of something that has gone on since 2014 when Russia seized [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1203.32s)]
*  Crimea. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1209.1599999999999s)]
*  But where were some of the escalations? [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1210.32s)]
*  In August 31st of 2021, the United States withdrew from Afghanistan. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1212.48s)]
*  Date certain, we're leaving on August 31st. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1220.16s)]
*  And they did, even though they left US civilians behind. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1222.8400000000001s)]
*  But on September 1st of 2021, the United States entered into a strategic partnership agreement [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1226.0s)]
*  with Ukraine to support their membership in NATO and their membership in the European [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1231.0400000000002s)]
*  Union. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1236.4s)]
*  So all that fall of 2021, there were escalation after escalation. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1237.64s)]
*  And there was a real possibility for diplomacy, but it's centered around what is the future [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1242.1200000000001s)]
*  of Ukraine? [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1246.8400000000001s)]
*  Is it part of NATO or not? [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1247.8400000000001s)]
*  Is it foreclosed to Ukraine to say, look, you're going to be somewhere in between? [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1248.8400000000001s)]
*  And the administration and NATO secretary general kept saying, no, this is non-negotiable. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1255.72s)]
*  And on February 22nd of 2022, Jens Stoltenberg gave a speech talking about how important [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1262.44s)]
*  it was for NATO to be able to project power around the world in Asia and elsewhere. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1269.72s)]
*  Well, why would a defensive alliance, NATO, need to project power anywhere? [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1276.52s)]
*  It's a defensive alliance. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1282.2s)]
*  So two days later, that's when Putin invaded Ukraine. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1283.76s)]
*  And he went in with a force of 100,000. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1287.4s)]
*  It was a more limited mission. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1289.76s)]
*  Who wasn't inspired when Vladimir Zelensky says, I don't need a ride out. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1292.2s)]
*  I need ammunition. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1296.44s)]
*  I mean, that was motivating. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1297.44s)]
*  And they have held Russia at bay. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1298.44s)]
*  And they initially started talking about diplomacy, less reach of peace deal. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1301.8799999999999s)]
*  And it's widely reported around the world, but scantily reported in the United States, [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1306.1599999999999s)]
*  that those negotiations were scuttled by the Biden administration because they said, no, [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1313.2s)]
*  no, don't give up being part of NATO. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1318.9199999999998s)]
*  Don't give up being part of the European Union. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1321.44s)]
*  We got your back as much as it takes, as long as it takes. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1323.44s)]
*  And all that's happened in between is you've got hundreds of thousands of casualties on [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1326.08s)]
*  both sides. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1329.52s)]
*  And you're still like, is there going to be a diplomatic resolution? [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1330.52s)]
*  Or is it going to be like Victoria Nuland, the deputy secretary of the State Department, [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1333.4s)]
*  says that the end state is regime change in Russia and war crimes tribunals for Vladimir [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1338.8s)]
*  Putin? [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1344.12s)]
*  And anyone rational knows that's a recipe for World War III. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1345.12s)]
*  There are people that think that's somehow good and somehow defending America's national [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1348.44s)]
*  interests and defending America first is somehow bad. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1355.16s)]
*  And that really is the crux of the debate. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1359.84s)]
*  You wrote an article in 2019, the American Conservative Magazine, and the title of it [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1363.32s)]
*  was Trump is Right, Ending the Endless Wars Starts in Syria. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1367.8799999999999s)]
*  And the sub headline was the Neocon consensus has brought nothing but disaster if the president [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1372.84s)]
*  wants to chart another course we should support him. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1377.36s)]
*  Now I really recommend that article and I'm going to ask you about a passage in just a [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1380.56s)]
*  second. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1383.6399999999999s)]
*  But in general, if you look at polling data over the last 15 years, a wide array of Americans [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1384.6399999999999s)]
*  across the spectrum, left, center, right, say that they are tired of America's posture [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1391.1599999999999s)]
*  of endless war, that they want us to stop being involved in so many foreign wars, financing [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1396.12s)]
*  so many foreign wars. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1401.1599999999999s)]
*  Trump ran in 2016 in opposition to our constant involvement in other countries militarily [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1402.6s)]
*  and won. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1410.12s)]
*  And yet it seems like Washington always finds new wars to be involved in despite the sentiment. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1411.6399999999999s)]
*  I mean, the war in Afghanistan was ended and it wasn't even six months later when we decided [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1418.8799999999999s)]
*  to get involved in a new war that the military industrial complex could help fund and arm [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1425.1599999999999s)]
*  in Ukraine. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1429.48s)]
*  I mean, I realize the Russians evaded, but we made the decision to involve ourselves [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1430.64s)]
*  in that. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1434.28s)]
*  I guess there's kind of like a cynical view that sometimes is described as a conspiracy [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1435.28s)]
*  theory. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1439.08s)]
*  But I think it's pretty pragmatic that war is very profitable for obviously certain corporations, [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1441.1200000000001s)]
*  arms dealers, the military industrial complex. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1448.28s)]
*  They have a lot of powerful lobbyists in Washington. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1451.0s)]
*  They spread a lot of money around to multiple members of Congress, the executive branch. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1453.0s)]
*  Is that a meaningful factor in why despite all the sentiment against endless war, the [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1458.56s)]
*  United States continues to be involved far more than any other country in multiple wars [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1464.9199999999998s)]
*  one after the next? [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1469.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's a big factor. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1470.96s)]
*  And when you look, there was a hard time for the country to get off of the wartime footing [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1473.6s)]
*  of World War II. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1477.84s)]
*  And because of that, Dwight Eisenhower, who narrowed our focus, looked the last time the [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1480.6399999999999s)]
*  United States had the kind of debt to GDP ratio we have now, 125 percent more debt than [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1485.52s)]
*  the economy, 25 percent larger than the whole size of our economy, was at the end of World [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1492.24s)]
*  War II. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1496.6s)]
*  And at the end of World War II, we reset the entire monetary system at the Treaty of Bretton [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1497.6s)]
*  Woods and the U.S. dollar thankfully became the world's reserve currency. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1501.68s)]
*  But right now, we're putting that at risk. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1505.68s)]
*  I mean, let's not forget that the way that the United States prevailed in the Cold War [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1507.28s)]
*  the Soviet Union, and they did it largely by spending excessively on defense and not [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1512.12s)]
*  taking care of the fundamentals of their own economy. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1517.12s)]
*  Eisenhower scaled down right after World War II and invested in American infrastructure [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1520.4799999999998s)]
*  and spent minimal amounts on military power and used nuclear deterrents as the main threat [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1524.7199999999998s)]
*  and caught grief from the military. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1533.7199999999998s)]
*  He's the five-star general that led victory on D-Day, victory in World War II, was Dwight [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1536.44s)]
*  Eisenhower, which is why both parties wanted him to be president. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1542.28s)]
*  And in his farewell address, he cautions against the military industrial complex and the scientific [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1544.96s)]
*  technical elite, so people like St. Fauci. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1550.16s)]
*  And why? [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1553.68s)]
*  Because these people would have massive influence with the public, they'd be deemed credible, [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1554.8s)]
*  and there would be a risk that they would put their own interest and the truth at odds [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1560.44s)]
*  with America's interest. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1564.3600000000001s)]
*  And I think you're seeing that for sure in case after case. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1565.68s)]
*  And so how do they pull that off in the House of Representatives if you're not for more [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1569.3600000000001s)]
*  wars in more places, you don't get on the war committees, you don't get on foreign affairs, [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1574.48s)]
*  you don't get on intelligence, and you don't get on hash the House Armed Services Committee. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1578.28s)]
*  We finally broke that by working with Kevin McCarthy, part of his path to becoming speaker [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1582.6200000000001s)]
*  was working with conservatives for months, if truly years, to line up the support to [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1587.8s)]
*  be able to reform Congress some. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1593.48s)]
*  And after being here for six years at that time, I finally got on to foreign affairs [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1595.6399999999999s)]
*  despite having been an Army Ranger in Germany when the Berlin Wall came down. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1600.46s)]
*  So that's how they've locked everybody out. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1606.96s)]
*  And if you look at elections, as you say, go back to 06, the party that was talking [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1609.8s)]
*  about being less involved in more wars in more places did better politically because [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1614.1599999999999s)]
*  the American people will defend America. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1618.8799999999999s)]
*  They just don't want to defend an empire. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1621.44s)]
*  So speaking of that, and it is amazing how the parties have so radically changed. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1624.24s)]
*  I mean, the only critique that you hear about this posture of endless war and empire and [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1629.04s)]
*  the military and desert complex, for the most part, comes from conservatives and the Republican [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1634.0800000000002s)]
*  Party. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1638.04s)]
*  The Democratic Party is almost completely united, certainly in support of the war in [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1639.04s)]
*  Ukraine. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1643.0800000000002s)]
*  But one of the things you wrote in that article on the American conservatives that I really [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1644.0800000000002s)]
*  will read is the following. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1647.3600000000001s)]
*  You said, quote, the United States cannot indefinitely be the guarantor of stability [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1649.3200000000002s)]
*  in the Middle East. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1654.92s)]
*  American actions have ultimately empowered Iran rather than checking its relentless efforts [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1656.48s)]
*  to destabilize the region. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1661.0s)]
*  At some point, we must restore America's foreign policy to more limited objectives. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1662.5200000000002s)]
*  President Trump bringing our troops home is an essential and important step in the process. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1667.4s)]
*  It is an overdue rejection of the flawed consensus that has caused much of the present [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1671.6s)]
*  situation. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1677.04s)]
*  Now, I think it's very clear how that applies to the United States financing of the war [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1678.04s)]
*  in Ukraine. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1682.6s)]
*  There's a second war that the United States is currently financing, which is the Israeli [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1683.6s)]
*  war in Gaza. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1687.36s)]
*  And I realize most members of Congress are supportive of Israel on Israel's side and [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1688.36s)]
*  the war against Hamas. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1694.0s)]
*  But the question I have is, it's not just that we're supporting Israel. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1695.6799999999998s)]
*  The United States gives Israel $4 billion a year every year. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1698.72s)]
*  And then whenever they have a new war, we finance their war. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1702.02s)]
*  We pay for the bombs they use, the weapons that they use. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1704.84s)]
*  Given that rationale that you just laid out in that article and in some of your answers [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1708.92s)]
*  as well, namely that we can't afford to keep financing these wars, that it's not in our [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1713.84s)]
*  interest, why shouldn't Israel pay for its own wars? [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1717.8s)]
*  Why do Americans have to do that? [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1721.74s)]
*  Well, one way we could save some money is funding only one side of the war in Israel. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1725.44s)]
*  And frankly, they're funding both sides of the war. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1729.8400000000001s)]
*  The Biden administration wants to port into Gaza so that they can supply Hamas while simultaneously [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1732.2s)]
*  funding Israel. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1739.3200000000002s)]
*  And so the last version of the supplemental that we voted on in the House that was a standalone [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1740.68s)]
*  bill with no pay for, I was one of, I think, 14 Republicans that voted against it, not [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1747.4s)]
*  because we don't support Israel, but for two practical factors. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1752.32s)]
*  One, Israel has less debt than we do, and they have a better debt to GDP ratio, debt [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1755.9199999999998s)]
*  to income ratio than we do. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1761.08s)]
*  But the other part is in the current Biden administration, Joe Biden doesn't need more [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1763.1599999999999s)]
*  leverage over Benjamin Netanyahu to try to influence Israel to negotiate with Hamas. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1769.12s)]
*  I mean, Hamas still has hostages, over 100, including eight American citizens. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1777.52s)]
*  And Joe Biden is telling Benjamin Netanyahu to back off of attacking Hamas and to negotiate [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1782.92s)]
*  for a two-state solution, which is part of what Hamas wanted when they did the 10-7 massacre, [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1790.92s)]
*  and to have a ceasefire to work something out with the people of Gaza, which is essentially [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1797.0s)]
*  strike peace with Hamas while they're still holding hostages. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1805.8s)]
*  So the Biden administration is trying to have both sides of the war, and the United States [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1809.08s)]
*  should speak with clarity for sure. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1813.76s)]
*  And I think certainly we don't need to give more leverage to Joe Biden in his efforts [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1816.12s)]
*  to do it. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1820.6s)]
*  Let's not forget that Chuck Schumer was calling for parliamentary elections to try to move [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1821.6s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu out of power. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1825.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1828.24s)]
*  I mean, just to be clear, the amount that the United States gives to Israel is a massively [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1829.24s)]
*  larger amount than the humanitarian aid that the United States provides to the Palestinians. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1835.24s)]
*  But I take your point. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1839.08s)]
*  I just have a couple more questions, just out of respect for your time. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1841.0s)]
*  The issue of the war in Ukraine, I just want to ask about that. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1845.96s)]
*  One of the things you had said, and you referred to the fact that Antony Blinken just this [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1856.38s)]
*  last week had vowed in a more declarative way than I think ever that Ukraine will absolutely [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1860.36s)]
*  be part of NATO. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1867.8799999999999s)]
*  He was standing next to the Ukrainian foreign minister at the meeting of NATO foreign ministers [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1869.1999999999998s)]
*  when he said that. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1874.36s)]
*  There has been at the highest levels of the US government warnings that any attempt to [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1876.6799999999998s)]
*  put NATO or to expand NATO to include Ukraine up to the most sensitive part of the Russian [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1882.1599999999999s)]
*  border would almost certainly provoke a Russian attempt to meddle in eastern Ukraine, to perhaps [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1886.96s)]
*  seize and annex Crimea. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1893.52s)]
*  There was a memo in 2008 warning Condoleezza Rice and the neocons in the Bush administration, [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1895.72s)]
*  including Victoria Nuland, who was then the US ambassador to NATO, by Bill Burns, the [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1900.44s)]
*  current CIA director, where he said, it's not just Putin, it's essentially everyone [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1904.32s)]
*  across the spectrum in Russia regards NATO expansion up to include Ukraine as a grave, [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1908.64s)]
*  even existential threat to Russian security. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1916.04s)]
*  Was there in your view on some level, at least in some factions in Washington, almost a desire [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1920.2s)]
*  to provoke the Russians into this invasion? [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1926.52s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, none of that justifies Putin and Putin's invasion, but absolutely. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1929.08s)]
*  That was what I was pointing out with the escalation from September 1st of 2021 all [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1934.48s)]
*  the way up to the invasion was a continuing escalation of NATO rhetoric. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1939.84s)]
*  And I think culminating when Jens Stoltenberg, the secretary general of NATO says that it's [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1945.3200000000002s)]
*  essential that NATO has an ability to project power around the world. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1951.0400000000002s)]
*  And like, well, if I'm a Russian, I think that's a provocation for sure. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1955.6000000000001s)]
*  But even as an American, I'm sitting there going, wait, wait, wait, I was in Germany [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1961.5600000000002s)]
*  was part of NATO. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1966.64s)]
*  Why would NATO need to project power anywhere? [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1968.0800000000002s)]
*  And so I definitely think that our intelligence community knows that it's a provocation and [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1973.08s)]
*  they work to convey in many ways that it was in fact a provocation. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1981.4399999999998s)]
*  So just one or two more questions briefly. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1986.36s)]
*  So that experience that you had being in the military, being in the army in Germany at [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1989.52s)]
*  the time of the fall of the Soviet Union is incredibly important part of history. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1994.76s)]
*  And there are a lot of people who were part of the process where the Russians agreed to [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=1998.96s)]
*  allow the reunification of Germany, which given 20th century history is obviously a [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2003.48s)]
*  very alarming, daunting threat that the Russians would obviously perceive from Germany for [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2008.48s)]
*  obvious reasons. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2016.12s)]
*  And yet the argument that a lot of people make is that Gorbachev agreed to do that in [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2017.12s)]
*  exchange for a US promise that NATO would not expand. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2021.36s)]
*  Obviously NATO was going to expand eastward with the unification of Germany to include [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2026.08s)]
*  East Germany, which had been part of the Warsaw Pact. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2028.84s)]
*  But the Americans had agreed never to expand NATO even one inch eastward toward the Russian [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2031.6799999999998s)]
*  border. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2037.84s)]
*  Is that your understanding of what happened? [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2039.12s)]
*  And do you think the almost immediate attempt under Clinton and then Bush to expand NATO [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2042.12s)]
*  eastward is something that made the situation between the United States and Russia more [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2047.56s)]
*  antagonistic than it needed to be? [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2052.52s)]
*  Yeah, I know that the Russians view that as a broken promise by the West. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2055.56s)]
*  And that certainly feeds the Russian nationalist sentiment that keeps Vladimir Putin in power. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2061.72s)]
*  So they definitely believe it. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2068.98s)]
*  And historians can debate the factual accuracy of it. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2071.16s)]
*  You had statements made by people that maybe implied something else. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2074.04s)]
*  But those conversations did have, and it might not be a precise quote, but the idea of one [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2078.34s)]
*  inch east is certainly part of the negotiations. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2082.92s)]
*  And that's the thing. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2087.32s)]
*  You have side conversations. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2088.32s)]
*  Are they part of a deal? [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2091.14s)]
*  Well, if you signed a deal, they're part of the deal. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2092.36s)]
*  If not, well, you had conversations. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2094.52s)]
*  And I think that's part of the thing. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2097.2000000000003s)]
*  Did we officially have a deal? [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2098.52s)]
*  Because on the other side, some people will say, well, we helped facilitate Ukraine giving [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2100.32s)]
*  up their nuclear weapons so that you wouldn't have some small starter government in control [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2104.6800000000003s)]
*  of nuclear power. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2110.2000000000003s)]
*  You would have Russia in control of the nuclear weapons in America, and that's overall lower [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2111.36s)]
*  risk. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2117.36s)]
*  So we kind of implied that we would guarantee Ukraine's security. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2119.04s)]
*  And yeah, well, conversations are different than a treaty. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2124.7200000000003s)]
*  We didn't enter into a treaty to defend Ukraine. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2127.78s)]
*  And frankly, a lot of people are acting as if Ukraine is already a member of NATO. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2130.8s)]
*  And I think the way that Russia guarantees that Ukraine never does become a member of [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2135.36s)]
*  is they have a long war. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2139.96s)]
*  A long war favors Russia. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2140.96s)]
*  It doesn't favor the United States. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2143.08s)]
*  It doesn't favor Ukraine, and it certainly doesn't favor Western Europe. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2144.4s)]
*  Russia can do this scale of war for a long time, and I think they're kind of counting [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2148.36s)]
*  on it. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2153.1s)]
*  And frankly, who else is counting on it is China, because while we're distracted over [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2154.1s)]
*  here in Ukraine, just like we were for the previous 20 years, China is building the biggest [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2157.7200000000003s)]
*  military. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2164.08s)]
*  They'll say, oh, Putin is just going to keep rolling west. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2165.08s)]
*  You guys are like Neville Chamberlain was with Hitler. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2167.68s)]
*  Putin is going to be like Hitler. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2171.96s)]
*  Putin did not spend the last 25 years building the world's most lethal military, but China's [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2173.68s)]
*  been building theirs. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2178.3599999999997s)]
*  And the United States has been completely unfocused after the Cold War, and China has [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2180.12s)]
*  been very focused after the Cold War. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2184.8599999999997s)]
*  So last question. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2187.44s)]
*  I want to make it about China, because I have a ton of things that I'd love to ask you, [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2188.44s)]
*  but in respect for your time, I'll make this the last question. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2191.7999999999997s)]
*  I'd love to have you back on. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2193.52s)]
*  When the US withdrew after 20 years of a war in Afghanistan, spending $2 trillion, [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2195.92s)]
*  the Chinese published a video basically mocking the United States for spending so much on [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2202.4s)]
*  foreign wars that had no effect. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2207.62s)]
*  The Taliban just marched right back into power as though nothing had ever happened, and they [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2209.12s)]
*  contrasted all the money that we spent on these foreign wars with the $800 billion that [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2213.1s)]
*  they spent building a high-speed rail system that the United States doesn't have, connecting [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2218.28s)]
*  all their cities and their rural areas. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2223.58s)]
*  And obviously it helps trade a lot. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2225.8199999999997s)]
*  And while it's true they built up their military, it's also true the Chinese haven't actually [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2228.2999999999997s)]
*  been involved in a war since 1979. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2233.2999999999997s)]
*  Do you think that part of the harm to the United States from going around having all [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2236.46s)]
*  these kinds of wars is that China is able to exploit the resentment that that produces [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2241.02s)]
*  to say, look, it's the United States destabilizing the world. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2245.9s)]
*  We don't have any interest in military domination, so come and join BRICS. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2249.9s)]
*  It'll be better for the world and better for your country. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2253.94s)]
*  Yeah, I truly believe that China may well have learned more from the Eisenhower presidency [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2257.9s)]
*  than America has. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2265.2200000000003s)]
*  Unfortunately, we have not been focused. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2267.02s)]
*  Look what Eisenhower did is he got us to a period of peace and stability. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2269.6600000000003s)]
*  He spent less money on the military. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2272.98s)]
*  He built up American infrastructure and grew our economy. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2274.34s)]
*  We were growing like crazy. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2277.5s)]
*  Things were great for America. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2278.92s)]
*  And then of course the war hawks got us into a distraction in Vietnam for 10 years. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2280.76s)]
*  So if you look at where we are today with China, they have been focused and the United [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2286.96s)]
*  States has not been. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2294.84s)]
*  And look, we're less free, we're less safe, we're more burdened by debt, all those things. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2295.84s)]
*  Really I lay at the feet of the neocons. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2300.92s)]
*  Neocon, let's not forget, is another word for not conservative. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2302.8s)]
*  And they've got an alliance with the Democrats on the other side. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2307.12s)]
*  They're bankrupting our country and bankrupt countries are really hard to defend. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2311.0s)]
*  China, I think, is counting on them. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2315.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2317.3599999999997s)]
*  I mean, 15 years ago, Democrats were calling neocons extremists and Nazis and now they're [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2318.3599999999997s)]
*  in a very full scale alliance with the neocons in your party. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2322.88s)]
*  Congressman, you bring a very interesting and unique perspective and I really enjoyed [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2327.0s)]
*  talking to you about it. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2331.7599999999998s)]
*  We hope to have you back on. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nR7OWqwd8M&t=2332.7599999999998s)]
