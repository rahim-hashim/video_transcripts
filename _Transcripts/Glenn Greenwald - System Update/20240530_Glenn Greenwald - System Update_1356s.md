# Ari Shaffir Confronts Howie Mandel About Jewish Victimhood: Glenn Greenwald Reacts
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [May 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc)
*  As viewers of the show know, one of the things that we have talked about and covered most [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=0.0s)]
*  often since October 7th, and it's a topic about which I feel quite passionately, is [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=10.38s)]
*  the way in which America and so many pro-Israel conservatives on the American right, many [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=16.18s)]
*  of whom I've been aligned with on a lot of different issues, primarily the issue of free [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=21.02s)]
*  speech and opposing censorship and opposing the dividing up of everybody into little minority [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=24.98s)]
*  groups and insisting on special rights for them based on their demographic characteristics [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=30.380000000000003s)]
*  or insisting that everybody in a certain minority group are victims who need special protection, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=35.980000000000004s)]
*  including censorship protection. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=40.34s)]
*  So many of them have completely reversed all of their claim beliefs because this time the [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=43.260000000000005s)]
*  censorship is in their interest. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=48.019999999999996s)]
*  for a cause that they support. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=49.38s)]
*  The speech that's being censored is speech that they hate. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=52.980000000000004s)]
*  And I've spoken about this often on other shows, on this show, so I don't want to give [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=57.34s)]
*  you my views on that again, but I do want to show you a remarkably interesting and I [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=63.1s)]
*  think highly illuminating conversation that took place when Howie Mandel, who's a Jewish [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=67.46000000000001s)]
*  comedian, had on his podcast another Jewish comedian, Ari Shafir. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=72.7s)]
*  And Ari Shafir comes from this kind of the world of Joe Rogan. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=77.9s)]
*  I think he became very well known for how many times he went on Joe Rogan's show. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=81.34s)]
*  And although Joe Rogan's show and that kind of sphere of comedians that grew up around [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=85.30000000000001s)]
*  him aren't really politicized in the classic sense, that's one of the reasons why Joe Rogan [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=91.7s)]
*  is popular among so many people, they do have certain views in common or certain values [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=96.06s)]
*  in common, one of which for certain is a lot of hostility toward woke ideology to the idea [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=101.36000000000001s)]
*  that people should be canceled or censored because of things that they say. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=107.82s)]
*  That is probably the connective tissue between all of these people. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=113.02s)]
*  And they particularly hate efforts to self-victimize, to insist that your group is somehow so marginalized [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=117.38s)]
*  and unfairly treated that you can't succeed or that you're endangered. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=124.53999999999999s)]
*  And I've watched a lot of people who have been saying those things for years, if not [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=129.26s)]
*  decades, who are American Jews, who are conservative or who are at least anti-woke suddenly start [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=134.82s)]
*  sounding like every leftist at Oberlin's campuses with purple hair that they've been mocking [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=143.22s)]
*  for the last decade. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=149.06s)]
*  Suddenly they're in the one group that's endangered in the United States that needs protection. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=151.85999999999999s)]
*  And this is all the things that Hallie Mandel shared, I think, without even any plan of [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=155.78s)]
*  doing so with Ari Shafir, just assuming that Ari Shafir would agree with him because this [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=160.9s)]
*  is something that Hallie Mandel is hearing from everywhere. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=166.57999999999998s)]
*  He's something he just assumes is true. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=168.7s)]
*  We believe there's no other side to this. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=170.7s)]
*  And yet Ari Shafir didn't in a way that was really interesting because of how organic [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=174.5s)]
*  it was. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=178.26s)]
*  It was not a political conversation overtly, but Ari Shafir was obviously responding and [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=179.26s)]
*  reacting to the things Hallie Mandel was saying. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=183.94s)]
*  I want to play it for you because I thought it was an incredibly effective way of debunking [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=186.3s)]
*  what has become in some ways the dominant strain in American politics. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=191.38s)]
*  How many congressional hearings have we had over the last eight months on this topic? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=194.34s)]
*  How many times have members of Congress gone to Israel and proclaimed their commitment [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=198.74s)]
*  to battling anti-Semitism in the United States? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=204.7s)]
*  There have been laws passed and presidents of campuses fired and speech codes implemented [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=207.26s)]
*  and censorship laws enacted all in the name of this cause. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=215.57999999999998s)]
*  So because there's so many people saying it from every side and so few people contesting [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=219.45999999999998s)]
*  it because if you contest it you'll immediately be accused of being an anti-Semite, a lot [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=224.45999999999998s)]
*  of people just assume it's true because they never even realize that there's another way [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=228.5s)]
*  of looking at it. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=233.85999999999999s)]
*  That's how views often get formed in the United States. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=234.85999999999999s)]
*  And that was clearly the case for Hallie Mandel. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=237.33999999999997s)]
*  And you'll see how surprised he was that somebody obviously likes and thinks he's like-minded [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=238.82s)]
*  doesn't see it that way at all. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=244.46s)]
*  Let me show you part of this. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=245.58s)]
*  Speaking of culture, you know, like we were just saying there were three Jews sitting [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=247.22s)]
*  here. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=250.94s)]
*  Have you felt the- [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=251.94s)]
*  So by three Jews he's referring to himself, Hallie Mandel, his daughter who's a co-host [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=252.94s)]
*  of his podcast and then Ari Shafir. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=257.34s)]
*  So he's saying speaking of groups or whatever there are three Jews here. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=259.34s)]
*  We were just saying there were three Jews sitting here. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=263.3s)]
*  Have you felt the- are you feeling the- [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=265.34s)]
*  What? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=269.26s)]
*  The fucking- we're back in- [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=270.26s)]
*  The love? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=271.26s)]
*  Dude, we're back. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=272.26s)]
*  Center of attention again. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=273.26s)]
*  I love it. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=274.26s)]
*  Really? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=275.26s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=276.26s)]
*  We were a joke before. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=277.26s)]
*  Now we're taking it seriously. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=278.26s)]
*  Who else wants some? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=279.26s)]
*  Who else wants some? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=280.46s)]
*  You seeing the positive in this? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=282.14s)]
*  Yeah, dude, we're fucking- [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=283.74s)]
*  He likes attention. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=284.74s)]
*  Yeah, we're back. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=285.74s)]
*  Before we were just some like joke, like, ah, you remember the tribe? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=286.74s)]
*  Like little light things. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=289.65999999999997s)]
*  Now people take us seriously. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=290.94s)]
*  Seriously? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=292.94s)]
*  Go ahead, keep pushing the students. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=293.94s)]
*  See what we push back. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=294.94s)]
*  It's horrible. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=295.94s)]
*  It's not horrible. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=296.94s)]
*  It doesn't happen. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=297.94s)]
*  It's statistically irrelevant. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=298.94s)]
*  It should be on the news too much. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=299.94s)]
*  None of it's really happening. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=301.62s)]
*  Are you fucking kidding me? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=302.62s)]
*  I've been all over the country. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=303.62s)]
*  I've seen no actual anti-Semitism. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=304.62s)]
*  Have you? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=307.62s)]
*  You walked around, people yelled you at you or something? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=308.62s)]
*  I don't go out. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=311.1s)]
*  Yeah, good point. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=312.1s)]
*  I don't go out. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=313.1s)]
*  I did. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=314.1s)]
*  I yelled you at him this morning. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=315.1s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=316.1s)]
*  I think it's real. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=317.1s)]
*  I think we've got to take it seriously. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=318.1s)]
*  I think what you're saying is wrong. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=319.74s)]
*  No, it's being on the news. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=321.38s)]
*  Are you familiar with the- what's that app that tells you all the robberies in your neighborhood? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=323.1s)]
*  Citizen. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=327.94s)]
*  Citizen app. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=328.94s)]
*  I mean, I think this app, everybody's having a great time in their neighborhood, and then [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=329.94s)]
*  suddenly all these housewives are like, there's a robbery every 20 minutes. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=332.82s)]
*  I can't believe everything's going to shit. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=335.9s)]
*  They're just aware of it suddenly, the small percentages. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=337.7s)]
*  It's a little bit in colleges you don't go to. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=341.14s)]
*  It's not there. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=344.06s)]
*  It's statistically irrelevant. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=345.06s)]
*  I go all over the country. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=346.7s)]
*  Now imagine that here you have Howie Mandel, and again, he was a very famous comedian in [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=348.62s)]
*  the 80s and 90s. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=355.98s)]
*  I don't know how- I think he's still pretty well known. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=356.98s)]
*  He's been on Judge on one of those reality shows on a major network, so I think he's [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=359.86s)]
*  probably well known. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=364.94s)]
*  But he just got done saying, after saying, oh wow, Jews are really being mistreated in [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=366.46000000000004s)]
*  the United States. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=371.54s)]
*  We are being assaulted. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=372.54s)]
*  We're being attacked. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=373.54s)]
*  Then when he was asked, like, what? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=374.54s)]
*  Has that happened to you even once? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=378.38s)]
*  He says, oh, I don't go out. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=381.58000000000004s)]
*  So how does he know? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=383.82s)]
*  The explanation that Ari Shafir is giving, I think, is a very important point, not just [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=386.78s)]
*  for this topic, but generally, which is social media has the ability to distort so many issues. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=390.73999999999995s)]
*  You can take extremely aberrational incidents and just post one of these aberrational incidents [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=397.46s)]
*  every day or every week, and then people who follow you and think that you're reporting [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=405.5s)]
*  accurately will think they're seeing the truth. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=409.41999999999996s)]
*  I have countless number of Jews in my life. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=413.78s)]
*  My entire family is Jewish. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=417.02s)]
*  Most of my friends with whom I grew up in the United States when I was a kid are Jewish. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=419.26s)]
*  I don't know of a single Jewish person in the United States that has ever been the victim [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=424.5s)]
*  of an anti-Semitic act or expression of hatred toward Jews, let alone having some kind of [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=431.29999999999995s)]
*  epidemic of it since October 7th. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=438.53999999999996s)]
*  I just spent more than a week in the United States, and then the prior week in Canada. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=441.94s)]
*  It never even occurred to me that I was somehow endangered because someone might think I'm [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=447.7s)]
*  a Jew or might recognize me and know I'm a Jew and then assault me. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=455.14s)]
*  This is not anything that's happening, as Ari Shafir is saying. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=461.41999999999996s)]
*  This does not exist. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=465.09999999999997s)]
*  And yet, American Jews have been told for eight months now that they cannot send their [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=467.7s)]
*  children to school. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=472.86s)]
*  They cannot send their kids to colleges, that on Ivy League campuses they're being violently [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=475.26s)]
*  assaulted. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=480.09999999999997s)]
*  I know on social media, I kept hearing all the time, oh, there's hordes of people going [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=481.09999999999997s)]
*  around chanting, kill the Jews, kill all Jews. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=485.62s)]
*  And I would ask, where? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=487.74s)]
*  Where? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=488.74s)]
*  Where did that ever happen on American college campuses? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=489.74s)]
*  Where people would claim, oh, there's so many Jews, Jewish students being assaulted physically [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=493.42s)]
*  or threatened with violence on American college campuses. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=499.3s)]
*  I would say, what are their names? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=501.42s)]
*  Show me the links to these reports. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=502.74s)]
*  It hasn't happened. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=506.34000000000003s)]
*  I'm not saying it never happened once, where some argument at Israel or the Gaza or whatever [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=507.34000000000003s)]
*  escalated into some physical confrontation. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=512.26s)]
*  But the only example anyone could ever point to was one that was promoted by Barry Weiss's [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=514.7s)]
*  Free Press and by other conservative journalists about a Jewish woman. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=519.74s)]
*  And they acted like she was just some random Jewish woman when in fact she's a longtime [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=527.12s)]
*  pro-Israel activist in the United States. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=530.58s)]
*  And they claimed that she was stabbed in the eye with a Palestinian flag. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=532.86s)]
*  And Mike Johnson, the speaker of the House, went to the Holocaust memorial ceremony where [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=539.0600000000001s)]
*  Joe Biden was. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=543.86s)]
*  And he stood up and said, we can't tolerate this anti-Semitism. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=545.38s)]
*  We now have Jewish students' portal being stabbed in the eye with a Palestinian flag. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=548.78s)]
*  Now obviously, if you say that, the image that you're deliberately invoking is one where [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=552.88s)]
*  some Muslim or Arab student has taken their Palestinian flag and stabbed the eye out of [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=557.48s)]
*  a Jewish student. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=562.18s)]
*  And this is like a pandemic, according to Mike Johnson. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=563.18s)]
*  This is like happening multiple times. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=565.04s)]
*  That went all over the media. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=568.48s)]
*  It turned out to be a complete hoax. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=569.48s)]
*  We reported on this. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=570.76s)]
*  We deconstructed it. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=571.76s)]
*  We showed you the video. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=573.88s)]
*  She was standing there. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=574.88s)]
*  Watching these pro-Palestinian protesters walk by. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=576.0s)]
*  She was yelling things at them. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=579.48s)]
*  And one of the people who walked by was waving a flag like you do with flags, just back and [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=581.56s)]
*  forth. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=585.96s)]
*  And he brushed by her. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=587.38s)]
*  And she claims it hit her in the face. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=588.68s)]
*  She went on television. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=591.28s)]
*  There was absolutely nothing. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=592.28s)]
*  The next day, there was nothing wrong with her eye. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=593.28s)]
*  I mean, if you get stabbed in the eye with a flag, with the sharp end of the flag, you're [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=595.12s)]
*  going to have eye damage if that actually happens. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=601.96s)]
*  She went on TV the next day. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=604.68s)]
*  And they were like, well, your eyes seem pretty good. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=605.68s)]
*  And she was like, yeah, the only real symptom I have had is a light headache. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=608.72s)]
*  I was fortunate. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=611.76s)]
*  It's like, you were fortunate. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=612.76s)]
*  You mean it didn't happen. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=614.04s)]
*  And that's the only example I've heard. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=616.0s)]
*  So you have this complete moral panic, this complete fabricated victim narrative that [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=618.8399999999999s)]
*  isn't real. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=624.04s)]
*  And the people pushing it are the same conservatives who insist that any victimhood narrative from [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=626.28s)]
*  literally every other minority group in the United States, from black people, from Latinos, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=632.5600000000001s)]

*  right instantly mock it, insist it's not real. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=648.9200000000001s)]
*  They point to the Jussie Smollett hate crime hoax. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=653.48s)]
*  This is eight months of a Jussie Smollett hate crime hoax, but not happening just in [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=656.64s)]
*  an isolated incident, but writ large in terms of the entire country. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=663.0s)]
*  And laws are being passed based on this hoax. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=667.16s)]
*  And investigations are being launched. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=669.96s)]
*  And hate speech limits and codes are being implemented on college campuses. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=672.88s)]
*  And laws being enacted based on this victimhood narrative that the right mocked in every other [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=678.08s)]
*  case except this one, where they finally are either members of that group, so want to claim [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=683.84s)]
*  victimhood status for themselves, or it's a group of people with whom they just feel [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=688.36s)]
*  some sort of empathy because their religion tells them Israel is special and blessed and [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=692.76s)]
*  chosen. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=699.96s)]

*  Let me show you a little bit more of this, just because this is not a person who's a [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=703.72s)]

*  Actually, that's not true. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=807.48s)]
*  There was an incident I had, which is where I debated Alan Dershowitz [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=809.96s)]
*  on the question of whether we should attack Iran and whether we should be [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=814.12s)]
*  fighting Israel's wars. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=820.24s)]
*  And I was obviously critical of the idea that we should attack Iran, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=822.0s)]
*  critical of the idea that we should go to war for Israel, that Israel is [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=824.6s)]
*  guilt free. And as I was leaving the auditorium, I was surrounded by this [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=828.4s)]
*  extremely hostile yelling mob of pro-Israel, Upper West Side Jews and [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=833.0400000000001s)]
*  other Israel supporters who were quite menacing in their behavior. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=840.88s)]
*  As I think I said before, I lived in New York for 15 years, so I understand how [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=846.16s)]
*  New Yorkers can get agitated. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=849.6800000000001s)]
*  It's just kind of their way. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=853.4s)]
*  But if you didn't know that, any person would have felt menaced. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=854.68s)]
*  I mean, they were physically surrounding me. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=858.4s)]
*  I mean, really screaming at me, not trying to engage in any dialogue, just like [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=859.64s)]
*  insulting me in very personal ways. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=863.52s)]
*  You know, how can you be a Jew? [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=865.3199999999999s)]
*  You're not. You are a disgraced Jew. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=866.76s)]
*  You know, that sort of thing. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=868.88s)]
*  So, but not only have I never experienced any of this in my entire life, let alone [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=871.1999999999999s)]
*  since October 7th, and, you know, I don't live in the U.S., though I've been there [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=878.12s)]
*  quite often since October 7th. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=881.76s)]
*  Again, I don't know a single person. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=884.04s)]
*  I want to do any of you know a single person, a single Jewish person who is the [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=885.36s)]
*  victim of some sort of hate crime or physical attack or like very vicious [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=891.2s)]
*  violent assault since October 7th? [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=896.84s)]
*  I'm not saying it never happens. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=898.92s)]
*  Everything happens. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=900.24s)]
*  You know, there are actually like massacres of black people by white [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=902.16s)]
*  nationalists. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=905.28s)]
*  Those are things that happen. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=905.84s)]
*  One went to Buffalo and killed 10 people in a supermarket. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=906.8s)]
*  Another went into a church in South Carolina and gunned down, I believe, nine [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=909.68s)]
*  or 10 people because they were black. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=914.92s)]
*  There was recently a similar hate crime in Jacksonville. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=917.52s)]
*  So, but no conservative says, oh, well, if there's an incident that you could point [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=920.88s)]
*  to where black people are being slaughtered for being black, that must mean [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=924.4799999999999s)]
*  that we have a racism epidemic in the United States and we have to rearrange [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=928.7199999999999s)]
*  our laws. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=931.2399999999999s)]
*  No, they'll mock you if you say that. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=931.5999999999999s)]
*  But where are those? [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=934.88s)]
*  Obviously nothing like that has happened since October 7th. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=936.9599999999999s)]
*  But where is any of this? [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=939.8399999999999s)]
*  These are completely fabricated claims. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=942.4s)]
*  And he's right that if you, that it all comes from social media, just people [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=945.64s)]
*  repeating it over and over and over. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=950.5999999999999s)]
*  I told you I had this experience. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=952.0799999999999s)]
*  It was driving me crazy. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=954.92s)]
*  For months, all I heard, I kept hearing, what do you mean free speech? [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=957.3599999999999s)]
*  You don't have the right to go around chanting, kill all Jews. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=962.56s)]
*  And I would say, where did that ever happen? [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=965.7199999999999s)]
*  What, on what college campus were groups of people, protesters, pro-Palestinian [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=968.08s)]
*  protesters, going around chanting, kill all Jews? [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=973.04s)]
*  Where, where did this happen? [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=976.12s)]
*  And that was what Elise Stefanik tried to imply when she was questioning the [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=979.16s)]
*  presidents of Harvard and Penn who got fired at MIT, who hasn't yet, was what [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=982.88s)]
*  about calls for genocide? [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=988.04s)]
*  And they were reluctant to answer because they knew that a lot of Israel [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=990.44s)]
*  supporters claim that any criticism of Israel is a call for genocide. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=993.96s)]
*  And that's why they were saying, well, it depends on the context, which of course [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=997.8s)]
*  it did, that's the free speech theory that you should want college presidents adopting. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1000.4399999999999s)]
*  Now the problem is they don't adopt that free speech posture in almost any other [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1006.04s)]
*  case. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1011.3199999999999s)]
*  So when they did it here, they just had no credibility that was their fault. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1011.5999999999999s)]
*  But Elise Stefanik is somebody who is trying to be Trump's vice president. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1015.88s)]
*  She has spent the last decade just scorning woke ideology and identity [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1020.8399999999999s)]
*  politics, and there is no greater practice of identity politics in the United States [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1025.68s)]
*  than American Jews insisting that they are a victim group, either because people [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1030.72s)]
*  don't like Israel or people don't like Jews. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1036.8s)]
*  And I think of all the different minority groups that you might want to claim that [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1040.3200000000002s)]
*  about American Jews are one of the most difficult to try and depict as some sort [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1043.5600000000002s)]
*  of marginalized and discriminated against and repressed minority group that can't [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1050.3600000000001s)]
*  thrive or prosper in the United States. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1054.92s)]
*  The reason this narrative exists and is coming from so many places is precisely [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1057.88s)]
*  because American Jews, like other minority groups like Nigerian Americans or Indian [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1061.52s)]
*  Americans, do quite well in the United States and have a lot of influence and power [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1066.96s)]
*  in various sectors. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1070.2s)]
*  But this whole victimhood claim from the very people who claim to hate victimhood [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1072.92s)]
*  discourse has been so bizarre to watch. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1078.3600000000001s)]
*  And I just showed you the first, I don't know, three or four minutes or so. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1082.3600000000001s)]
*  If you want to watch the rest of it, it continues like this in a very persuasive [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1088.4s)]
*  vein. You can just go to YouTube and search Howie Mandel, Ari Shafir, and [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1092.1200000000001s)]
*  anti-Semitism and you'll immediately find it. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1098.56s)]
*  There's about the whole podcast is, I think, two hours long, but this portion of [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1100.28s)]
*  the discussion is, I think, 10 minutes, 25 seconds. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1103.76s)]
*  So you can find it. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1107.1200000000001s)]
*  I would highly recommend it. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1108.16s)]
*  I found it incredibly engaging because I don't want to, I think it's an important [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1109.08s)]
*  point to make, an interesting point to make, which is sometimes people who are [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1114.84s)]
*  immersed the most in politics, who are paid to be political commentators or [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1119.36s)]
*  analysts or whatever, who live in New York and Washington, are just constantly [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1125.6799999999998s)]
*  immersed in political discourse, often are the most incapable of seeing the [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1129.0s)]
*  truth, of seeing reality because they're just so blinded by the discourse [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1134.32s)]
*  controlled by political social media. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1139.24s)]
*  Their brains are just drowned in it. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1142.0s)]
*  And I had this experience once. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1145.28s)]
*  I really don't like these kind of attempts to like romanticize, like working class [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1146.84s)]
*  people, people in the middle of the country. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1152.12s)]
*  They can be just as awful as anybody else. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1154.0s)]
*  But I remember one time it was actually at the time when The Intercept had its [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1156.84s)]
*  one of its biggest scandals that had nothing to do with, but was blamed on me, [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1164.28s)]
*  which was when they got a hold of that story about this memo that claimed with [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1168.2s)]
*  no evidence that Russia actually interfered in the 2016 election by trying to [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1173.84s)]
*  change votes and they, through total carelessness and unprofessional and [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1177.84s)]
*  amateur behavior, unintentionally outed the source, which was reality winner. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1183.1200000000001s)]
*  And the scandal made it to the front page of the New York Times. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1189.8000000000002s)]
*  And I was in a cafe for other just reasons in Milwaukee, just outside [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1194.48s)]
*  Milwaukee, like a suburb of Milwaukee, just like in a diner or whatever, having [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1200.0800000000002s)]
*  lunch. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1203.3200000000002s)]
*  And it's kind of been all for political people to talk about, oh, I was in a [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1204.28s)]
*  diner in the middle of the country, but I really was. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1207.88s)]
*  And there was a group of, I don't know, five people, obviously like they were [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1210.52s)]
*  had like working class uniforms, like labor uniforms on. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1215.08s)]
*  And they were, the way they were talking, it was obviously not people very [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1221.48s)]
*  politically engaged, but they had, they would have, you know, on their phone, [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1224.68s)]
*  like whatever the top two or three stories were on the New York Times, they [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1227.52s)]
*  would see those and they would look at those. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1230.32s)]
*  And one of the stories was about how The Intercept so poorly handled the source [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1232.76s)]
*  of their source and source protection and unintentionally outed her. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1240.48s)]
*  But it was also about the story itself, about how the Russians were trying to [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1244.92s)]
*  influence the 2016 election. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1249.04s)]
*  And what they were saying, they didn't really have any interest in The Intercept [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1251.3600000000001s)]
*  part of the story, but they were saying, you know, when it comes to this, all [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1254.1200000000001s)]
*  these claims about Russia, this was 2017. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1257.68s)]
*  So obviously the whole 2016 campaign was based on this. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1261.1200000000001s)]
*  And then we were into the Trump presidency where the Steele dossier had [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1263.88s)]
*  flooded the media and everything was Russia and Trump and Russia and Trump. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1268.24s)]
*  And they kind of said, look, it's so hard to know what's true when it comes to all [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1271.36s)]
*  these claims about Russia, because they're always anonymous and you never see any [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1276.04s)]
*  evidence for it and it's impossible to know if it's true or not. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1280.1200000000001s)]
*  And it was all, that's all they said. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx15nL1KUJc&t=1282.88s)]
