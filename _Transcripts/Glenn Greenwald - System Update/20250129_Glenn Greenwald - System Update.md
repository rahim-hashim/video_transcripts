# Lab Leak Revelations Prove Corrupt Suppression of COVID Dissent
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [January 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc)
*  One of the things that we have covered most often is the development in the wake of the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=0.0s)]
*  2016 defeat by Donald Trump of Hillary Clinton, as well as the decision by the British people [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=11.52s)]
*  to leave the EU of this censorship industrial complex that has been designed to impose on [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=17.04s)]
*  the internet wide ranging censorship frameworks to prevent debate on the most consequential [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=23.52s)]
*  issues of the day. And we've obviously covered both that industry as well as censorship in [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=28.84s)]
*  the abstract and the evils of it, the importance of free speech and specific instances of censorship. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  But undoubtedly one of the most extreme events that ushered in a new round, a whole new universe [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=39.32s)]
*  in fact of systemic internet censorship was the COVID pandemic. And at the time it seemed [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=45.2s)]
*  evident exactly what was taking place. But because censorship was so aggressively imposed [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=53.4s)]
*  throughout the West, but also in the United States on any attempt to question, let alone [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=59.6s)]
*  deviate from the pronouncements of Dr. Anthony Fauci and the entire Western scientific establishment, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=63.6s)]
*  it was extremely difficult even to protest the censorship because the censorship meant [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=70.56s)]
*  that very few people were hearing any dissent. That's the whole purpose of censorship after [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=74.8s)]
*  all. And as a result, huge numbers of people believe that what they were being told was [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=78.4s)]
*  not just true, but so unquestionably true that we shouldn't even allow any dissent to it, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=83.04s)]
*  that dissent to it was dangerous. And we've seen a lot of evidence over the last couple of years [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=88.60000000000001s)]
*  emerge as it so often does that so many of those original claims that were made by Fauci and his [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=93.72s)]
*  associates inside the scientific community that they decreed and proclaimed with absolute scientific [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=100.38000000000001s)]
*  certainty, the point that they said nobody should be allowed to question us, any dissent to our [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=106.52000000000001s)]
*  pronouncements is an attack on science and will kill people. And it succeeded in persuading large [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=110.96s)]
*  institutions throughout the West to simply bar any dissent from COVID. We're now seeing enormous [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=117.96s)]
*  amounts of evidence that demonstrates that not only were most of the views that were censored [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=123.72s)]
*  viable and reasonable with ample basis to believe, but in many cases, especially on the core question [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=128.68s)]
*  that was most censored, which is what was the origin of COVID, the censorship was directed at [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=137.96s)]
*  views that as it turned out were true, the claims that were being protected with censorship from [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=143.56s)]
*  dissent were the claims that turned out to be false. We have the latest part of the government [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=148.24s)]
*  that today or this week rather came out and made clear that they now believe as well that the most [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=155.20000000000002s)]
*  likely origin of COVID was not as Fauci and his associates insisted they knew to be a animal to [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=162.28s)]
*  human leap that occurs in nature, but rather a lab leak from the Wuhan lab in Wuhan, the place [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=169.92000000000002s)]
*  where coincidentally the COVID virus and pandemic began here from the New York Times on January 25th, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=175.28s)]
*  the CIA now favors the lab leak theory to explain COVID's origin and new analysis that began under [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=181.32s)]
*  the Biden administration is released by the CIA's new director, John Ratcliffe, who wants the agency [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=187.04s)]
*  to get quote, off the sidelines in the debate, quote, there is no new intelligence behind the [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=192.32s)]
*  agency shift, officials said rather it is based on the same evidence. It has been chewing over for [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=197.0s)]
*  months. The analysis, however, is based in part on a closer look at the conditions in the high [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=201.6s)]
*  security lab in Wuhan province before the pandemic outbreak, according to people familiar with the [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=206.48s)]
*  agency's work. Intelligence officials interviewed in recent weeks say it is possible that such a [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=210.95999999999998s)]
*  piece of evidence exists in a lab in China, at least in theory, but they said it is still more [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=215.68s)]
*  likely that the answers to questions surrounding the virus's origin will come through a scientific [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=220.4s)]
*  breakthrough, not a intelligence revelation. Under the Biden administration, the intelligence [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=224.24s)]
*  community leaned toward the theory that the virus came from the market, but officials readily admitted [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=229.16s)]
*  it was hardly a sure thing. This is what is so offensive about it. I know there are still people [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=234.08s)]
*  who believe that it was more likely than not that it came from a wet market or because the Chinese [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=238.88s)]
*  ate bats and that transmitted the virus and enabled it to sleep into the human species. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=244.44s)]
*  And I don't even really have that much of an interest in trying to insist that you're wrong. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=250.92s)]
*  The issue here is that that debate was foreclosed from the beginning based on absolutely false, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=255.44s)]
*  knowingly false assertions of scientific certainty that Fauci and his associates simply never had. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=262.76s)]
*  They misled and deceived the public about the level of their knowledge about COVID's origin. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=270.36s)]
*  And they did so not with any benevolent or noble intentions to protect the public, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=274.64s)]
*  but to protect themselves because it turns out that so many of them were invested in or had [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=279.88s)]
*  funded or approved of or knew about or worked on exactly the kind of work in Wuhan that made a lab [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=286.2s)]
*  leak and made a coronavirus highly contagious to humans much likelier than the naturally [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=294.36s)]
*  occurring virus by manipulating what the virus was, engaging in gain-of-function research and [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=305.64s)]
*  then lying about it. And they were petrified that if the world knew that the reason that this [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=310.28000000000003s)]
*  pandemic had been unleashed that had terrified the entire world, that they helped terrify the world, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=315.64s)]
*  came not from some natural occurrence that they were the saviors, but rather from their own work. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=320.12s)]
*  And people began blaming these scientists. They knew that would be very dangerous for them, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=325.48s)]
*  and so they used their scientific credentials. They exploited them and manipulated them right [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=331.52s)]
*  at the start before almost anything was known to lie and claim that they had already determined [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=336.68s)]
*  that it was a naturally occurring zoonotic leap and that there was no basis for believing that [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=341.84000000000003s)]
*  it came from a lab and anyone claiming that was guilty of racist disinformation. Now, as I said, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=350.0s)]
*  throughout the Obama, throughout the Biden years, agencies within the government started to solely [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=356.8s)]
*  acknowledge that there was ample evidence for a lab leak and that they believed that it was the [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=362.32s)]
*  likelier origin of the pandemic. Here from BBC in March of 2023, FBI Chief Christopher Wray says [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=366.8s)]
*  China lab leak is most likely. FBI Director Christopher Wray has said that the Bureau believes COVID-19 [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=374.56s)]
*  most likely originated in a Chinese government controlled lab. Quote, the FBI has for quite [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=379.44s)]
*  some time now assessed that the origins of the pandemic are most likely a potential lab leak, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=384.08s)]
*  he told Fox News. It is the first public confirmation of the FBI's classified judgment [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=388.96s)]
*  of how the pandemic virus emerged. A few days before that, CNN reported, it was this February [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=393.68s)]
*  of 2023, the US Energy Department assesses that the COVID-19 pandemic likely resulted from a lab [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=401.44s)]
*  leak furthering US intelligence divide over the virus origin. Quote, the US Department of Energy [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=407.76s)]
*  has assessed that the COVID-19 pandemic most likely came from a laboratory leak in China, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=413.76s)]
*  according to a newly updated classified intelligence report. Two sources said the [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=418.4s)]
*  Department of Energy assessed on the intelligence report that it had, quote, low confidence [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=422.88s)]
*  the COVID-19 virus accidentally escaped from a lab in Wuhan. Some of them have said, but with a [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=427.03999999999996s)]
*  low level of certainty, that the virus did not start in a lab but instead jumped from animals [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=431.28s)]
*  to humans. The White House has said there is no consensus across the US government on the origins. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=435.92s)]
*  A joint China World Health Organization investigation in 2021 called the lab leak theory, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=441.36s)]
*  quote, extremely unlikely. However, the WHO investigation was deeply criticized and its [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=446.08000000000004s)]
*  director general has since called for a new inquiry saying, quote, all hypotheses remain open [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=452.40000000000003s)]
*  and require further study. This is not just an issue of the past. This is so important to [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=458.16s)]
*  understand what happened here, especially with this new evidence from the CIA. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=465.12s)]
*  Because this is the sort of thing that happens continuously to this day is these people step [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=469.52s)]
*  forward, they cite their credentials, they claim they have superior knowledge to you, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=474.24s)]
*  and they do that not with the intention of saying to you that you should listen to what they have [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=479.52s)]
*  to say and be open-minded and perhaps be persuaded by them. That would be reasonable. Instead, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=483.28000000000003s)]
*  they say that they possess alone the absolute truth, so much so [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=488.79999999999995s)]
*  that any attempt to question them or dissent from anything they're saying is so dangerous that it [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=496.23999999999995s)]
*  has to be barred. That is the foundational premise of the censorship regime with which we are living, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=501.2s)]
*  still living, even if this COVID pandemic seems like ancient history, it is not. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=506.88s)]
*  In February of 2020, right as the pandemic was emerging, it was still situated in China, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=511.6s)]
*  it had spread to Iran and then to Spain and Italy where we were hearing all kinds of terrifying [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=518.4s)]
*  reports embracing for its arrival in the United States. This is how the New York Times reacted [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=523.84s)]
*  when Tom Cotton, the Republican from Arkansas, speculated that perhaps the [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=530.08s)]
*  virus originated not from the zoonotic leap of animals to humans, but instead from a leak [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=535.92s)]
*  from the Wuhan lab, quote, Senator Tom Cotton repeats fringe theory of coronavirus origins. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=541.76s)]
*  Remember, this was February of 2020, no one had heard of the coronavirus [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=547.68s)]
*  until about two months previously, and the New York Times pretended that it was so obvious [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=553.76s)]
*  that it was so obviously true, so scientifically demonstrated that [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=561.68s)]
*  you had this natural leap and it wasn't from a leak from scientists' own work in the Wuhan lab [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=568.0s)]
*  that they were calling people who suggested otherwise guilty of spreading fringe theories. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=573.8399999999999s)]
*  Here's how they talked about it, quote, scientists have dismissed suggestions that [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=577.8399999999999s)]
*  the Chinese government was behind the outbreak, but it's the kind of tale that gains traction among [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=582.64s)]
*  those who see China as a threat. The rumor appeared shortly after the new coronavirus struck China and [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=588.32s)]
*  spread almost as quickly that the outbreak now affecting people around the world had been [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=593.12s)]
*  manufactured by the Chinese government. The conspiracy theory lacks evidence and has been [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=596.64s)]
*  dismissed by scientists, but it has gained an audience with the help of well-connected critics [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=601.76s)]
*  of the Chinese government, such as Steve Bannon, President Trump's former chief strategist, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=606.8000000000001s)]
*  and on Sunday it got its biggest public boost yet. Speaking on Fox News, it was the first [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=611.12s)]
*  public boost yet. Speaking on Fox News, Senator Tom Cotton raised the possibility that the virus [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=615.84s)]
*  had originated in a high-security biochemical lab in Wuhan, this Chinese city, at the center of the [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=620.56s)]
*  outbreak. Quote, we don't have evidence that this disease originated there, said the senator said, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=625.52s)]
*  but because of China's duplicity and dishonesty from the beginning, we need to at least ask the [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=630.0s)]
*  questions to see what the evidence says, and China right now is not giving evidence on that question [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=634.08s)]
*  at all. Do you see how these newspapers, these news outlets, like the New York Times, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=639.28s)]
*  speak so authoritatively, so smugly, so derisively about anybody who expresses a view different than [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=646.16s)]
*  the one they've decreed to be the true one, even though they had no basis whatsoever in February of [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=653.12s)]
*  2020 for being so certain or smug about anything, but because they had obedience to Tony Fauci and [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=658.24s)]
*  that entire health, public health establishment, this is what they do all the time. They publish [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=665.92s)]
*  things in their newspaper, pretend that they have certainty over them, and so often they're at best [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=673.12s)]
*  debatable and more often than not false. Do you see the tone that they use? So if you were reading [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=678.3199999999999s)]
*  in 2020 and you were scared of what this COVID pandemic was and you trusted the New York Times, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=683.12s)]
*  you would really believe that it was already determined by all scientists, you all agree, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=687.76s)]
*  that it lead from human to animal and that anybody even questioning the possibility that it came from [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=694.64s)]
*  a Wuhan lab were doing so because they're conspiracy theorists who hate China. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=698.7199999999999s)]
*  Here's what Tom Cotton said when he went on Fox News. Remember this is February 2020 before the [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=706.0s)]
*  virus even got to the United States. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=710.16s)]
*  We have to get to the bottom of that. We also know that just a few miles away from that food market [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=715.92s)]
*  is China's only biosafety level four super laboratory that researches human infectious [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=720.88s)]
*  diseases. Now we don't have evidence that this disease originated there, but because of China's [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=727.3599999999999s)]
*  duplicity and dishonesty from the beginning, we need to at least ask the question to see what [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=733.92s)]
*  the evidence says and China right now is not giving any evidence on that question at all. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=739.12s)]
*  So this super lab that you refer to, this super lab is the only one of its kind in this area, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=744.4s)]
*  in Wuhan, in the province, that area and what do they do with the super lab? [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=752.24s)]
*  It's unclear Maria. We have such laboratories ourselves in the United States run by our military [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=758.56s)]
*  and large part done for preventative purposes. We're trying to discover vaccines or to protect [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=764.64s)]
*  our own soldiers. China is obviously very secretive about what happens at the Wuhan laboratory. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=770.32s)]
*  We don't know again where this virus originated. That's why it's so important that we at least [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=776.08s)]
*  ask the questions and get the evidence, but China continues to block our ability to ask those [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=781.36s)]
*  questions and get that evidence. But in terms... Now just one thing about what he said there, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=786.8s)]
*  which is like, oh, by the way, we also do this research, meaning we also manufacture and create [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=791.04s)]
*  and weaponize biological weapons. And you recall, we've reported on this before. I've reported a lot [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=795.92s)]
*  on the anthrax attacks in 2001. That came very shortly after the 9-11 attacks and really elevated [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=802.3199999999999s)]
*  the fear levels inside the United States. They were falsely blamed on Iraq. John McCain went on [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=808.64s)]
*  David Letterman, the first show that David Letterman had back after 9-11. And he said the [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=814.16s)]
*  telltale signs in this anthrax that was released inside the United States suggest strongly that [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=818.0s)]
*  Saddam Hussein's biological weapons program is behind it, already laying the groundwork for the [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=823.68s)]
*  war propaganda and the lies that would come. And of course, as it turned out, according to the FBI, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=828.8s)]
*  at least, the perpetrator of those anthrax attacks was actually somebody who worked inside a U.S. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=834.64s)]
*  military research facility at Fort Detrick, meaning that the United States government was itself [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=839.8399999999999s)]
*  weaponizing that anthrax. And when they got caught, no one really knew that they were weaponizing [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=844.88s)]
*  biological agents. Their excuse was exactly what Tom Cotton said. Oh, we just do it because [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=851.44s)]
*  we need to study these kinds of things in case China or Russia or Iran or the bad countries that [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=857.0400000000001s)]
*  do work on this attack us. We just need to figure out what a cure would be, not because we ourselves [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=862.1600000000001s)]
*  are weaponizing it. Perish the thought. Even though the worst biological attack in the United States, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=866.6400000000001s)]
*  in the United States history, came from a U.S. Army facility, according to the FBI. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=871.2800000000001s)]
*  But what he was saying there was simply like, look, the coronavirus originated in Wuhan [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=876.08s)]
*  and very close to the point where it originated, like a couple miles, is a research facility that [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=885.44s)]
*  works with coronaviruses. So perhaps we ought to consider the possibility [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=893.68s)]
*  that it originated in Wuhan because it came from the coronavirus lab. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=899.2s)]
*  And the reason we were told that, and by the way, I should say, [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=903.36s)]
*  that inside liberal circles, it was absolutely forbidden to even entertain that possibility. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=909.92s)]
*  Tony Fauci had said that China had nothing to do with it, the lab had nothing to do with it. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=918.8000000000001s)]
*  We know how it originated. Nobody was allowed to even question it on the internet. And the only [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=925.28s)]
*  time that any dissent really broke into liberal discourse was when John Stewart went on Stephen [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=930.08s)]
*  Colbert's program in June of 2021 and basically laid it all out in the most aggressive way possible [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=936.8000000000001s)]
*  while Stephen Colbert almost had a panic attack because what John Stewart was saying was [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=945.0400000000001s)]
*  prohibited to be said, especially inside places of good liberal standing such as Colbert. Let's [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=950.72s)]
*  remind ourselves what it is that John Stewart said when he went on Stephen Colbert's show, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=957.4399999999999s)]
*  still about a year into the pandemic only. A debt of gratitude to science. Science has [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=962.56s)]
*  in many ways helped ease the suffering of this pandemic, which was more than likely caused by [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=971.52s)]
*  science. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=981.84s)]
*  And that's kind of... [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=991.0400000000001s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Listen, listen. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=994.0s)]
*  It's coffee. I wouldn't do that to you. I wouldn't do that to you. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=998.8800000000001s)]
*  What do you mean by that? Do you mean like there's a chance that this was created in the lab? [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1002.8800000000001s)]
*  There's an investigation. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1006.72s)]
*  A chance? [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1007.7600000000001s)]
*  Well, if there's evidence, I'd love to hear it. I just don't know. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1009.04s)]
*  There's a novel respiratory coronavirus overtaking Wuhan, China. What do we do? Oh, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1011.84s)]
*  you know who we could ask? The Wuhan novel respiratory coronavirus lab. The disease [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1019.1999999999999s)]
*  is the same name as the lab. That's just a little too weird, don't you think? And then they ask [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1026.32s)]
*  scientists, they're like, how did this... So wait a minute. You work at the Wuhan [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1033.1999999999998s)]
*  respiratory coronavirus lab. How did this happen? And they're like, a pangolin kissed a turtle. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1037.52s)]
*  And you're like, no. The name of your lab... If you look at the name, look at the name. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1044.7199999999998s)]
*  Let me see your business card. Show me your business card. Oh, I work at the coronavirus lab [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1052.0s)]
*  in Wuhan. Oh, because there's a coronavirus loose in Wuhan. How did that happen? Maybe a bat [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1060.3200000000002s)]
*  flew into the cloaca of a turkey and then it sneezed into my chili and now we all have coronavirus. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1067.92s)]
*  Okay, wait a second. Wait a second. Wait a second. Wait a second. Wait a second. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1077.8400000000001s)]
*  All right. Oh my God. Oh my God. There's been an outbreak of chocolatey goodness [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1083.76s)]
*  near Hershey, Pennsylvania. What do you think happened? Like, oh, I don't know. Maybe a [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1090.8s)]
*  steam shovel mated with a cocoa bean or it's the chocolate factory. Maybe that's it. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1096.64s)]
*  That could be. That could be. I mean, that was something that we were told was not permitted [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1104.64s)]
*  to be said. And in fact, it was constantly barred from being expressed. It's amazing to think about, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1112.64s)]
*  especially given what John Stewart just laid out there and you saw how upset and nervous Steven [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1120.4s)]
*  Colbert was constantly trying to stop him from saying what he was saying, knowing that among [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1124.96s)]
*  his liberal audience, this was heresy. Dr. Fauci had spoken and that was that. The reason this all [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1130.0800000000002s)]
*  happened, the reason why the world was convinced that the answer was known, even though it wasn't, [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1138.72s)]
*  was because Dr. Fauci, he spent the last week in January and the first several weeks of February [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1146.16s)]
*  getting emails from epidemiologists around the world, the leading epidemiologists, [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1152.24s)]
*  many of whom are saying, I've analyzed this coronavirus and it seems likely that it was [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1157.2s)]
*  manipulated in a lab and came from a lab and that it was not naturally occurring. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1163.92s)]
*  They were telling him that in emails that he hid. And instead he coordinated this letter [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1169.92s)]
*  using his immense power over the research budget of the United States at the National Institute of [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1177.04s)]
*  Health, along with Francis Collins, his colleague who did the same. And they got this letter in the [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1182.24s)]
*  Lancet in February of 2020. Before the coronavirus even got here, obviously they had no idea what [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1188.96s)]
*  they were talking about. And it was designed to pretend that they did and to condemn everybody [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1195.2800000000002s)]
*  who was questioning whether it might have come from the lab in the way John Stewart just explained. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1199.7600000000002s)]
*  This is just 10 days after Tom Cotton expressed his speculation, so it was already in the air, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1206.24s)]
*  including from epidemiologists. Statement in support of the scientists, public health [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1213.28s)]
*  professionals and medical professionals of China combating COVID-19. You see how they [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1218.16s)]
*  framed it? Oh, we're in solidarity with these Chinese scientists who are combating COVID because [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1223.36s)]
*  they're being attacked. Quote, the rapid, open and transparent sharing of data on this outbreak is [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1229.36s)]
*  now being threatened by rumors and misinformation around its origins. We stand together to strongly [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1234.6399999999999s)]
*  condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1241.2s)]
*  Conspiracy theories do nothing but create fear, rumors and prejudice that jeopardize our global [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1246.0800000000002s)]
*  collaboration in the fight against the virus. We support the call from the director general of [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1250.96s)]
*  World Health Organization to promote scientific evidence and unity over misinformation and conjecture. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1255.8400000000001s)]
*  And from that point forward, everybody said they knew that the scientists told us it began [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1264.48s)]
*  in a naturally occurring setting and that any attempt to question the lab leak theory would be [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1270.72s)]
*  to unfairly attack the Chinese scientists. One of the people who signed that paper, in fact, [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1276.88s)]
*  one of the people who helped organize the signatures on it was Peter Dazic, who was part of [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1285.28s)]
*  the EcoHealth Alliance, and we've gone over this before, actually participated aggressively in the [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1291.04s)]
*  funding of the work that was done in the Wuhan lab to manipulate this virus, and he got funding [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1297.2s)]
*  from Anthony Fauci to do it. So he had an immense conflict of interest. It was obviously in his [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1303.92s)]
*  strong professional and reputational interest to say what he said in this letter, namely that, [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1309.76s)]
*  oh, don't worry about the work we were doing in Wuhan. That had nothing to do with it. That's [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1317.04s)]
*  a racist line of disinformation. We already know how it spread. It was from an animal to a human [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1320.48s)]
*  leap, and nobody should ever be questioning that because that's a racist attack on Chinese scientists [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1326.72s)]
*  and never disclosed the immense conflict of interest that he had in getting that consensus [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1331.3600000000001s)]
*  implanted, even though they had no knowledge of it, no basis for it. And it was only a year and [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1337.6000000000001s)]
*  three months later, here in June of 2021, that the Lancet finally posted what it called an addendum, [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1345.6000000000001s)]
*  competing interest in the origins of SARS-CoV-2, and it read, [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1352.32s)]
*  In February 2020, 27 political health experts co-authored a correspondence on the Lancet [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1356.1599999999999s)]
*  statement in support of the scientists, public health professionals, and medical professionals [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1363.52s)]
*  of China combating COVID-19, supporting health professionals and physicians in China during the [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1367.52s)]
*  early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this letter, the authors declared no competing interests. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1372.56s)]
*  Some readers have questioned the validity of this disclosure, particularly as it relates to one of [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1377.6799999999998s)]
*  the authors, Peter Daszak, and forced him to then explain himself in terms of the interest that he [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1381.28s)]
*  had. And there were other papers as well on the proximal origins of COVID, all designed to bolter [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1385.76s)]
*  the same consensus. As late as November 2021, almost two years into the pandemic, Dr. Fowlty [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1391.68s)]
*  was still insisting that they knew for certain the origin of this pandemic, and then started [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1401.6s)]
*  going around saying that any attempt to question what they've said is an attack on science because [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1409.2s)]
*  he, Dr. Fowlty, is science. So you question Dr. Fowlty or any of his pronouncements, it means that [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1414.24s)]
*  you are questioning science itself. Here's what he said on Face the Nation. Anybody who's looking at [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1420.72s)]
*  this carefully realizes that there's a distinct anti-science flavor to this. So if they get up [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1426.32s)]
*  and criticize science, nobody's going to know what they're talking about. But if they get up [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1434.24s)]
*  and really aim their bullets at Tony Fowlty, well, people could recognize there's a person there, [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1439.2s)]
*  so it's easy to criticize. But they're really criticizing science because I represent science. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1444.3200000000002s)]
*  That's dangerous. To me, that's more dangerous than the slings and the arrows they get thrown at me. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1451.44s)]
*  And if you damage science, you are doing something very detrimental to society long after I leave. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1457.52s)]
*  It's incredibly ironic that he's warning of the dangers of damaging science. I don't think [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1467.68s)]
*  anything in the history of science has damaged science more than what they did here. Fain a [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1473.76s)]
*  certainty they plainly did not have in order to shield themselves from questioning and criticism, [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1479.44s)]
*  and then censoring debate over one of the most significant public health crises in centuries. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1485.52s)]
*  The only thing I can think of that was as damaging to science is when public health officials [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1492.72s)]
*  unanimously demanded that nobody leave their house for months. Your relative died of COVID, [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1497.6s)]
*  your relative died of natural causes, you want to go to the funeral outside the burial. No, [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1505.36s)]
*  that's too dangerous. Stay at home. CNN turned into a celebrity, that idiot who dressed up as the [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1510.4s)]
*  Grim Reaper, and he went to the beach where families were with their kids spread apart [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1518.64s)]
*  in the sun, warning them that they were going to die, that they were basically the Grim Reaper. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1524.8s)]
*  They were going to die, they were going to kill people by virtue of going outside, even just to [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1531.3600000000001s)]
*  the beach, in the outdoors. And then in the summer when the Black Lives Matter protest started, [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1534.56s)]
*  and tens of thousands of people poured out into the streets in extremely close connection with [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1542.0s)]
*  one another, chanting and screaming and marching, those same public health officials said it's not [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1546.1599999999999s)]
*  only justifiable to go outside, but it's actually morally obligatory to do so. So they had exploited [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1551.9199999999998s)]
*  their public health credentials to say stay at home, stay at home, and stay at home until there [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1559.04s)]
*  was a protest that they liked. And then they finally said no, you can go outside, in fact you [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1562.96s)]
*  should go outside. Other protests that they disliked, including protests against the repressive [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1568.16s)]
*  lockdowns, they condemned the people going to those protests as irresponsible because they disliked [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1573.1200000000001s)]
*  ideologically those protests. Soon as there was a protest movement that they liked ideologically, [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1578.48s)]
*  they felt compelled to endorse it. Think of a way to politicize and exploit and destroy the [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1582.56s)]
*  credibility of science more clearly than that. I'd love to hear it because I don't think you can [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1588.72s)]
*  come up with one and that's exactly what they did in 2020 along with this hardcore deceit by Tony Fauci. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1593.1200000000001s)]
*  Free speech is under attack. I believe that is, had something to do with what I was just talking [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1603.92s)]
*  about, but rumble refuses to back down. We've always believed in empowering voices no matter [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyeqi_BAQpc&t=1609.2s)]
