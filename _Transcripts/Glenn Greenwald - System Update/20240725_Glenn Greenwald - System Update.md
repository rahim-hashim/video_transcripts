# How Netanyahu's Address to Congress Reveals U.S. Priorities with Journalist Max Blumenthal
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [July 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4)
*  Okay, so now I do want to turn to Max Blumenthal, who I'm told is joining us live from his car. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=0.0s)]
*  I have no sound. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=13.68s)]
*  He has no sound, he says. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=14.68s)]
*  We'll try to get him sound. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=17.68s)]
*  That would be good for him to have sound. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  And you got it. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=22.28s)]
*  Now I can hear you. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=23.28s)]
*  You can hear me? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=24.28s)]
*  I know, Max, you enjoy nothing more than hearing my voice, so hopefully you can hear it now. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=25.28s)]
*  Well, you're looking great, and you're looking rested and ready down in Rio. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=30.48s)]
*  I have to confess, I wasn't able to get a front row seat for Netanyahu's speech. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=36.08s)]
*  I was out with the protest. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=42.48s)]
*  I've been out with the protesters since about noon and was treated to various volleys of [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=43.68s)]
*  percussion, grenades, tear gas, pepper spray. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=52.92s)]
*  Yeah, but I wasn't surprised reading the transcript of Netanyahu's speech or seeing the lowlights. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=58.24s)]
*  I wasn't surprised with anything that took place. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=68.84s)]
*  I'm shocked, Max, because I thought I spotted you in the audience next to Jerry Nadler and [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=74.28s)]
*  Josh Gottheimer applauding Netanyahu for saying how great of a job Joe Biden and Donald Trump [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=79.0s)]
*  have done in supporting Israel. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=86.8s)]
*  Maybe I mistook you for somebody else. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=88.67999999999999s)]
*  No, I was backstage with Netanyahu and Pastor John Hagee, but I wasn't in the photo. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=90.72s)]
*  Tony Perkins got in the way from the family research council. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=99.72s)]
*  So yeah, I mainly just saw the day of rage that erupted around the Capitol. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=103.84s)]
*  So describe to us the security situation in D.C. right now, because I was in D.C. not [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=111.67999999999999s)]
*  too long ago while the NATO summit was happening. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=115.56s)]
*  And they basically turned the convention center area into a fortress. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=119.24000000000001s)]
*  They have all kinds of militarized police patrolling and checkpoints, and you can hardly [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=124.08s)]
*  get from one street to another. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=127.88000000000001s)]
*  And you told me earlier today that there's something comparable going on with respect [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=130.88s)]
*  to the Netanyahu speech, which would be pretty amazing because it's not that uncommon for [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=134.7s)]
*  foreign leaders to come address joint sessions of Congress. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=139.92000000000002s)]
*  It happens actually pretty frequently from Japan or India or wherever. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=143.6s)]
*  But evidently, when our so-called greatest ally or the only democracy in the Middle East [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=147.92s)]
*  sends its prime minister or head of government to come address our legislative branch, they [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=153.56s)]
*  have to crack down in such extreme fashion in order to enable Bibi to have a wonderfully [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=158.44s)]
*  seamless address and receive all his endless ovations. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=166.6s)]
*  So just describe what the security situation has been like. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=170.44s)]
*  Yeah, great question. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=174.84s)]
*  I was actually shocked at how many police were on the streets. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=176.0s)]
*  And I got the sense that the police, through whatever coordination mechanisms they were [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=184.12s)]
*  using, whether it was Amtrak police, U.S. Capitol police, Park police, or the NYPD, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=191.08s)]
*  which sent 200 officers to D.C., they all were being prepared for some kind of Hamas [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=199.48000000000002s)]
*  attack or the possibility of Iran using its forces within this protest movement to actually [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=205.12s)]
*  stage some kind of lethal attack on the U.S. Capitol or on Union Station itself, which [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=213.82000000000002s)]
*  is next to the U.S. Capitol. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=220.4s)]
*  The entire Capitol was surrounded with rings of militarized police. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=223.92000000000002s)]
*  There was nowhere you could go where you didn't encounter police who looked like they were [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=229.4s)]
*  dressed, the Montgomery County police looked like they were dressed to go to a Renaissance [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=234.48s)]
*  Fair, like they had their shield, their club, they were wearing full body armor, it was [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=239.07999999999998s)]
*  95 degrees out, it was like a sauna, and they were ready for a reenactment of a Braveheart [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=244.68s)]
*  battle scene. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=250.6s)]
*  It was absolutely absurd. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=252.0s)]
*  The police were ordered to wear their gas masks at all times. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=253.92000000000002s)]
*  The D.C. police had tons of undercovers in the crowd who were obvious, tons of surveillance, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=257.6s)]
*  helicopters overhead, and lots of tactical police, along with less lethal weaponry, rubber-coated [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=264.76s)]
*  steel bullets, as I said, percussion grenades. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=272.76s)]
*  There was an initial kind of tussle with some protesters and they pepper sprayed a lot of [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=276.64s)]
*  people, including journalists in the face. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=281.28000000000003s)]
*  I was near that. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=284.28000000000003s)]
*  And there was nothing about the protest that was violent. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=285.64s)]
*  So what really struck me was that this all took place, this gigantic show of force. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=289.48s)]
*  I should mention also the Amtrak police were not letting anyone in Union Station at all [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=296.48s)]
*  without a ticket. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=301.12s)]
*  And this is a major gathering place for just people after work and people on Capitol Hill. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=302.12s)]
*  Right after Donald Trump's near assassination attempt, which was obviously the result of [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=309.0s)]
*  a Secret Service failure, or if you want to get conspiratorial, Secret Service stand down, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=317.08s)]
*  and in the shadow of January 6, which was the last time I saw the Capitol covered in [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=322.84s)]
*  that much fencing and fortification, people in D.C. were referring to it as Fort Netanyahu [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=329.04s)]
*  kind of half-jokingly. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=335.56s)]
*  The last time I saw it like that was after January 6, and I was at the January 6 protest, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=338.44s)]
*  not as a protester. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=343.68s)]
*  I just wanted to observe what was taking place there. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=344.68s)]
*  And it was obvious the police stood down. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=347.84s)]
*  There were hardly any police there, and they allowed this riot to take place and to rampage [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=350.2s)]
*  through the Capitol with very little resistance. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=359.5s)]
*  So it really kind of highlights who's in charge right now. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=363.66s)]
*  We also have Joe Biden shrinking from public view. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=369.26000000000005s)]
*  Many people are wondering where Joe Biden is. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=373.54s)]
*  He's supposed to meet Netanyahu tomorrow, and I don't believe he's addressed the U.S. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=376.38000000000005s)]
*  public yet to explain why he withdrew from the presidential race. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=380.38s)]
*  So Netanyahu was referred to by Dana Bash at CNN as akin to a U.S. president delivering [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=385.42s)]
*  a State of the Union address. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=394.18s)]
*  This really tells you how much power Israel has over our political system, even though, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=396.08000000000004s)]
*  as we can discuss, Netanyahu appeared more isolated than he's ever been. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=403.34000000000003s)]
*  Well, Max, on January 6, you may not have stormed the Capitol, but I would surmise that [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=408.22s)]
*  your mere presence there desecrated the temple of democracy. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=414.18s)]
*  So I'm not sure you should have admitted that in public because it implicates you in that [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=417.97999999999996s)]
*  day that will go down in history as like a double Pearl Harbor times 9-11. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=422.18s)]
*  I wanted to ask you, you read the transcript of Netanyahu's speech. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=431.09999999999997s)]
*  Netanyahu did bring up that there was this alleged plot that was Iranian-backed to assassinate [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=435.97999999999996s)]
*  Trump. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=443.1s)]
*  Now, there had been also these alleged plots against John Bolton and Mike Pompeo in retaliation [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=444.1s)]
*  for the drone assassination of Soleimani that Trump ordered in January of 2020, and they [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=450.5s)]
*  tried to connect that to the assassination attempt last weekend. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=457.32s)]
*  So I'm not sure how valid that connection was. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=463.1s)]
*  Obviously, it could be political opportunistic for that to be connected. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=466.02s)]
*  I wanted to get your take on how do you distinguish the nature of Republican support for Israel [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=471.42s)]
*  at this point versus the nature of Democratic support for Israel at this point, particularly [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=478.62s)]
*  within Congress, because I don't know that I can really recall many times when Republican [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=484.14s)]
*  members of the House have been so vociferous in their hooting and hollering and cheering [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=491.14s)]
*  for virtually anything. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=497.82s)]
*  When Netanyahu lauded Trump for being such a stalwart supporter of Israel, it looked [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=500.18s)]
*  like all the Republicans were having a collective orgasm, whereas the Democrats now at least [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=506.82s)]
*  have to give the appearance of being more tepid. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=511.9s)]
*  Now I think of their signaling tepidness toward Netanyahu himself, who they can villainize [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=515.38s)]
*  and try to separate from Israel at large and just use Netanyahu as this boogeyman, because [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=524.4200000000001s)]
*  he has been more affiliated with Republicans over the years. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=530.82s)]
*  Remember Netanyahu basically endorsed Mitt Romney over Barack Obama in 2012, so this [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=535.94s)]
*  would be nothing particularly new for him. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=540.74s)]
*  But the fervor among Republicans did stand out to me. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=544.3000000000001s)]
*  As you may know, I was at the Republican convention last week in Milwaukee and went around asking [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=549.88s)]
*  a lot of Republican members of the House how they reconcile the idea of America first with [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=554.06s)]
*  also declaring their unshakable support for Israel, and let's just say their answers were [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=560.0999999999999s)]
*  always not especially coherent. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=565.8199999999999s)]
*  So how do you distinguish the nature of Republican support versus Democratic support for Israel [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=568.6199999999999s)]
*  as of today in July 2024, at least vis-a-vis the elected official class in Congress? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=574.4599999999999s)]
*  Well, just first on the Iranian plot, I mean, the source for that plot was one unnamed human [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=582.22s)]
*  source, which could be anyone. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=587.26s)]
*  And it seems like the plot was kind of concocted to kind of lay the groundwork for Netanyahu [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=590.74s)]
*  to pin Trump's assassination on Iran and to interrupt diplomacy with Iran. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=597.9399999999999s)]
*  So who could the human source could have been someone introduced to the Israeli intelligence. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=602.5s)]
*  There's a history of that going back to the Cafe Milano plot, the phony plot against this [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=610.7800000000001s)]
*  Iranian opposition figure, Masih Alinajad, who's paid by the U.S. government to advocate [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=617.0200000000001s)]
*  for war with Iran. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=622.5400000000001s)]
*  And so that's highly suspect. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=625.2s)]
*  With the Republican Party today, there are so many contradictions that you're so good [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=628.22s)]
*  at exposing and pointing out about the hypocrisy of America firsters cheering a figure like [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=633.74s)]
*  Netanyahu. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=640.7s)]
*  And within the America First movement, there are those who seem to support Israel or Netanyahu [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=642.98s)]
*  on the most puerile basis simply because they look at the protesters outside and see blue-haired, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=650.86s)]
*  genderfluid people wearing funny clothes who are giving the finger to the cops. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=659.6600000000001s)]
*  And they just decide they hate them and that they hate queers for Palestine. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=664.46s)]
*  And Palestine is woke. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=668.3000000000001s)]
*  And therefore, Israel is the right side to support. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=669.98s)]
*  And that's Bibi said in his remarks something like, oh, and we have these gays for Palestine [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=674.0600000000001s)]
*  who are always out protesting on college campuses. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=681.1800000000001s)]
*  So he was playing right into the beating heart of like the culture war argument that Republicans [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=683.58s)]
*  use for their support for Israel. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=688.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=690.78s)]
*  I mean, like Marjorie Taylor Greene condemning Jewish voice for peace for staging a kind [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=692.78s)]
*  of protest sit-in inside the U.S. Capitol because she had been under so much attack [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=697.0999999999999s)]
*  by the media for January 6th. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=703.74s)]
*  And she said, well, here's the insurrection and the liberal media supports it is so puerile [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=706.4599999999999s)]
*  and so detached from what America First should be about. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=712.2199999999999s)]
*  The only Republican you see really embracing it in a principled way is Thomas Massey, who [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=716.86s)]
*  said, I'm not going to be part of a PR operation for the State Department and for war with [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=722.0600000000001s)]
*  Iran by being a part of this speech. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=727.1s)]
*  But you don't feel the Christian Zionist enthusiasm from a lot of the Freedom Caucus [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=731.42s)]
*  figures. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=737.34s)]
*  You feel like, well, they have nothing to gain by opposing Israel or supporting Palestine [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=738.22s)]
*  solidarity movement, which is overwhelmingly progressive and would reject their support. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=745.9s)]
*  And then you have Christian Zionists who really have been cultivated by the Israel lobby as [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=752.78s)]
*  what they, you know, I think it was AIPAC, an AIPAC official referred to it as Israel [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=761.26s)]
*  safety belt in the Bible Belt. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=767.9s)]
*  And with the Israel lobby, you have a very top heavy institution. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=770.0600000000001s)]
*  They don't have a grassroots base. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=775.9s)]
*  And so in the early 80s, they started cultivating evangelicals and very did so very successfully. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=777.58s)]
*  And now you have a generation of Republican congressmen who see there's they have no [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=782.86s)]
*  interest in discussing the issues for them. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=789.1s)]
*  This is about revelation. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=792.38s)]
*  This is about creating a landing pad for the Messiah. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=794.0600000000001s)]
*  You met some of them at the Republican National Convention and John Hagee, the leading Christian [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=796.78s)]
*  Zionist figure in the United States who heads Cornerstone Church in San Antonio, Texas, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=803.9s)]
*  has thousands and thousands of parishioners, is extremely wealthy through all the money [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=809.9s)]
*  he takes in. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=815.1s)]
*  His organization, Christians United for Israel, was actually set up by AIPAC. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=816.54s)]
*  And he has been almost created as this important political figure exclusively within the Republican [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=821.58s)]
*  Party by AIPAC. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=828.62s)]
*  So this is, you know, in some ways, it's a positive development for the Israel lobby. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=830.54s)]
*  They had feared that there would be anti-Semitism in middle America, that evangelicals wouldn't [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=836.46s)]
*  want to support the Jewish state. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=841.1s)]
*  And so they managed to pull off this feat. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=842.78s)]
*  But at the same time, if you actually look at AIPAC's positioning, its rhetoric, they're [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=844.94s)]
*  hiring more and more people out of Republican offices on Capitol Hill. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=851.58s)]
*  They're focusing increasingly on the Republican side. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=856.3000000000001s)]
*  They are losing massive support, not just among the progressive grassroots, but among [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=860.94s)]
*  elected Democrats. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=866.46s)]
*  And you saw over half of the House Democrats boycotted, close to half of the Democratic [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=867.58s)]
*  senators boycotted the speech. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=873.26s)]
*  So AIPAC's strength had always been that Israel was a bipartisan issue, that there was no [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=875.66s)]
*  daylight between either party in Israel. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=881.66s)]
*  And that's gone. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=884.7s)]
*  And this is really the legacy of Netanyahu, who, as you know, and probably most people [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=885.8199999999999s)]
*  watching know, is a card-carrying Republican who spent a lot of his time as an opposition [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=891.74s)]
*  leader in the 1990s, hanging out at AIPAC offices and palling around with mostly Republican [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=897.9000000000001s)]
*  politicians and lobbyists. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=905.1s)]
*  And he found that he was more successful selling them on his idea of Israel as a bulwark against [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=908.3000000000001s)]
*  terrorism and on the idea that the Palestinian state was an existential threat to Israel. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=915.34s)]
*  So liberal Zionism, which the Democratic Party had always adopted as its official ideology, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=921.98s)]
*  which held out that Israel wanted to make peace if they could just find the right Palestinian [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=928.46s)]
*  partner, has been basically extinguished, not just within Israel, where Netanyahu and [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=934.14s)]
*  the Likud party and more extreme elements within the settlement movement, the Messianic [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=940.0600000000001s)]
*  settlement movement, the Temple movement, which we can talk about more, are incipient, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=946.5400000000001s)]
*  but also within the Democratic Party, there just really is no base for. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=952.0600000000001s)]
*  Israel can be Democratic and exclusively Jewish. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=957.9000000000001s)]
*  So I managed, I broke away from the Palestine solidarity protest and I went to a small [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=961.58s)]
*  liberal Zionist protest outside the capital where they were trying to square the contradiction [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=967.82s)]
*  of Israel being still a potentially good Democratic country and Netanyahu just being the bad [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=974.6199999999999s)]
*  boogeyman. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=983.42s)]
*  This was put on by a liberal Jewish group called Trua and they brought other, there are many [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=983.9799999999999s)]
*  Israelis there who are family members of the hostages who blame Netanyahu for extending [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=990.06s)]
*  the war and allowing their family members to languish and die in Gaza, usually from Israeli [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=995.02s)]
*  bombings. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1003.74s)]
*  But the things they were saying were just delusional. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1005.1800000000001s)]
*  It was like they were talking about an Israel that exists in the canyons of their imagination [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1008.14s)]
*  and not the Israel that we see today where Netanyahu is basically a centrist figure. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1014.14s)]
*  They were saying America and Israel were founded on Democratic values and the belief in equality [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1018.94s)]
*  and we need to get back to that. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1024.3s)]
*  So that's just gone. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1026.14s)]
*  And so too are the hopes, I think, of the families who wanted a deal, who thought, well, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1029.18s)]
*  there could be a deal with Hamas. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1037.58s)]
*  Hamas clearly wants a deal. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1039.74s)]
*  They want to release the hostages and get Palestinian prisoners out. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1041.02s)]
*  I think Netanyahu wants the hostages to die or be killed and so does his support base [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1044.78s)]
*  in Israel. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1053.18s)]
*  There's strong evidence that that's almost an official policy because it deprives Hamas [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1053.66s)]
*  of leverage and if there are no hostages in Hamas's hands, there's nothing that can stop [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1061.9s)]
*  Israel from rampaging through Gaza, maintaining a permanent presence and tormenting and killing [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1068.22s)]
*  larger numbers of Palestinian prisoners in Israel's dungeons. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1077.18s)]
*  So Max, I want to read to you a quote that was given to me by Congressman Cory Mills, [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1080.94s)]
*  Republican of Florida, last week at the Republican convention. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1086.46s)]
*  He says that he believes that Donald Trump understands that the Constitution is, quote, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1091.82s)]
*  framed upon what are the Christian Judeo beliefs. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1095.74s)]
*  And Mills therefore says that, quote, you understand the prophecy of revelations. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1100.06s)]
*  Now he says revelations plural and it's revelations singular in the Bible. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1105.1799999999998s)]
*  So a lot of people who claim to believe the apocalyptic final book of the Bible don't [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1110.3799999999999s)]
*  understand what the book actually is titled, which is odd. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1114.54s)]
*  And it talks about the people of Israel who are God's children and who will fly on the [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1119.74s)]
*  back of an eagle. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1124.54s)]
*  It talks about the mountain of God, which is essentially Russia. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1126.1399999999999s)]
*  So that's Congressman Cory Mills of Florida talking about the book of revelation, which [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1130.38s)]
*  is literally apocalyptic, eschatology, as the basis for his imperative to support Israel. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1135.18s)]
*  Now he'll also tie it in with what he claims are U.S. strategic interests and this kind [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1142.7800000000002s)]
*  of thing that are more secular bent. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1147.18s)]
*  But the biblical imperative really is there and it's potent. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1149.2600000000002s)]
*  And unless you just disbelieve that their religiosity is authentic, I don't know how [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1152.94s)]
*  it couldn't be hugely influential in dictating the worldview on this stuff. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1158.46s)]
*  And if we can also show you the clip of me interviewing Congressman Andy Barr of Kentucky [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1163.18s)]
*  also at the Republican convention last week. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1171.42s)]
*  Let's go to that. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1174.8600000000001s)]
*  — Like terrorism. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1175.58s)]
*  Do you see there being any tension between the America First point of view and also so [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1176.8600000000001s)]
*  stalwartly supporting Israel? [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1181.5s)]
*  It seems like there might be some tension there. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1183.3400000000001s)]
*  At least some conservatives have complaints about that. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1185.58s)]
*  — If anyone is confused about that, let me set the record straight. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1187.5s)]
*  Being pro-Israel is America First. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1191.82s)]
*  Plain and simple. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1195.5s)]
*  — So there you have it, Max. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1198.46s)]
*  That's about as unambiguous a statement as you can get, I would think. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1199.9s)]
*  It reminds me of George H.W. Bush saying, read my lips, no new taxes. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1204.94s)]
*  But this is about Israel First and America First apparently being interchangeable concepts [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1209.58s)]
*  for these Republicans. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1216.3s)]
*  At least that's how they work through the seeming contradictions in their own minds. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1218.1399999999999s)]
*  So what do you make of those quotes? [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1222.06s)]
*  — I mean, I understand the thinking. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1225.5s)]
*  And with respect to Corey Mills, he's expressing a very common view of Christian Zionists who are [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1228.46s)]
*  pre-millennial dispensationalists, dispensationalists who believe that there will be a series of [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1237.58s)]
*  dispensations or crises and wars that herald the return of Christ. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1243.18s)]
*  And the major war will be between Gog and Magog with Iran, Russia, and China comprising [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1248.6200000000001s)]
*  the forces of Magog who will be destroyed by the holy forces fighting from Jerusalem. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1256.6200000000001s)]
*  This is all articulated in John Hagee's kind of like pulp novel-like [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1264.14s)]
*  books, like Jerusalem Countdown. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1270.8600000000001s)]
*  And it might sound absolutely insane because it is, but this is how it's understood and why there's [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1275.1000000000001s)]
*  so much support for conflict with Iran within the Christian Zionist quote unquote heartland. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1281.5s)]
*  And it all makes sense. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1290.6200000000001s)]
*  And it all sounds like it could be America First too because Israel, well, they think Israel's [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1293.18s)]
*  like us. Israel's supported by us. Their leader speaks English. He's not Hamas. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1299.66s)]
*  They don't have beards. They're not swarthy guys who live in tunnels, who worship Islam. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1306.7s)]
*  They seem to be more relatable. Netanyahu does a really good job of seeming American and Israeli [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1312.7s)]
*  at the same time. But when the shit hits the fan and conflict with Iran actually [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1319.98s)]
*  takes place, it's not going to seem so America First. And we already saw the consequences [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1329.8200000000002s)]
*  of this supposed America First policy when Donald Trump assassinated or, well, when Donald Trump [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1336.38s)]
*  heeded the lobbying pressure campaign of Netanyahu and Mike Pompeo to assassinate Major General [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1345.8200000000002s)]
*  Qasem Soleimani, there was a de facto cover-up of how many U.S. service members that the Al-Assad [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1352.14s)]
*  base in Iraq suffered traumatic head injuries and had to be evacuated out to Ramstein Air Base [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1359.5s)]
*  in Germany for urgent treatment. In the next round, it's not going to be traumatic head injuries. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1366.7s)]
*  There will be ships being sunk. There will be casualties to American soldiers. And we've seen [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1375.02s)]
*  with the USS Eisenhower an aircraft carrier that has been at sea for the longest deployment, [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1381.42s)]
*  I think since World War II of any battle carrier group, that the sailors are getting a little bit [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1388.94s)]
*  anxious and they're not really enjoying parrying missile attacks from the Ansarullah [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1396.3s)]
*  de facto government of Yemen, the Houthis. And they're just sick of being at sea forever. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1403.42s)]
*  This is sort of leaked out in the media through some social media postings of the soldiers. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1409.9s)]
*  But what they might start to understand is that they're there to protect shipping routes [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1416.22s)]
*  from the Houthis in order to protect Israel's strategic depth. They're not actually protecting [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1422.86s)]
*  the United States. They're not protecting our shores. They're not advancing American interests. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1429.66s)]
*  What would advance American interests and end the Houthi blockade, which would also end the Hezbollah [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1434.7s)]
*  attacks on northern Israel, is the U.S. president actually exerts some leverage [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1443.34s)]
*  and forces a ceasefire, which would be the easiest thing for an American president to do [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1450.9399999999998s)]
*  when you have in Israel its prime minister rushing to Washington to beg for weapons [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1455.58s)]
*  because Israel cannot survive another day without these constant supplies of 2,000-pound bombs, [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1462.86s)]
*  thousands of tank shells, the 155-millimeter Howitzer shells. It would have to negotiate for [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1470.46s)]
*  peace immediately without that. This all could have ended with one phone call, but they won't do [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1476.7s)]
*  that. So the idea of Israel being America first or being what Alexander Haig, Reagan's secretary [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1481.26s)]
*  of state, called America's unsinkable aircraft carrier hasn't fully been put to the test because [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1488.78s)]
*  the United States has not directly engaged with Iran and Iran's allies who have gotten more [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1495.26s)]

*  2006. And finally, Max, what about Donald Trump himself? Purportedly, he's the big kingpin of the [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1511.98s)]
*  America First movement, right? Mike Pompeo just had another prime speaking role at the Republican [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1519.74s)]
*  convention. Donald Trump has gone on Fox News relatively recently and denounced anybody who has [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1525.9s)]
*  a skeptical interpretation of various aspects of the October 7th attack as the new Holocaust deniers. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1534.38s)]
*  He has, at the debate, we played a clip earlier, he was attacking Joe Biden. Everybody was [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1542.78s)]
*  fixated on Biden's cognitive deterioration so they may have missed that Trump tried to derisively [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1548.38s)]
*  call Biden a Palestinian as though Biden hadn't been supplying these endless armaments to Israel [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1555.02s)]
*  for the past nine months and actually been a more generous provider of largesse to Israel than, I [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1561.74s)]
*  think, any president in U.S. history. But the critique from Trump and the Republicans is that [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1568.7s)]
*  actually Democrats are somehow pandering to the pro-Hamas faction of the party, which is like, [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1574.06s)]
*  has all the political leverage or something. What do you anticipate for a second Trump [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1579.98s)]
*  administration? You mentioned John Hagee earlier. Do you know who gave the opening benediction [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1587.82s)]
*  at the inauguration of the new U.S. embassy in Jerusalem, which Trump brags to this day that he's [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1593.4199999999998s)]
*  the one who finalized? It was attended by Jared Kushner and Charlie Kirk and Candace Owens even, [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1601.74s)]
*  and Friedman, the new ambassador. Do you know who gave the opening benediction? Can you guess? [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1610.78s)]
*  I don't remember. It was like Kenneth Copeland or something? [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1616.3s)]
*  No, it was John Hagee. John Hagee. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1618.06s)]
*  No, it was John Hagee. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1620.46s)]
*  John Hagee. Pastor John Hagee. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1621.34s)]
*  I thought it was somebody else. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1622.46s)]
*  John Hagee met frequently with Trump at the White House. Now, it's unlikely that Trump himself [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1623.74s)]
*  is a believing pre-millennial dispensationalist, right? But he has no qualm with elevating the [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1630.3s)]
*  most freakish, theologically blinkered adherents to that doctrine and giving them major roles [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1637.34s)]
*  of influence and even some policy-related power in the administration. There's every reason to [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1646.14s)]
*  think that that would proceed in a second administration because Trump's going around [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1654.94s)]
*  and basically doing a version of when Biden in 2020 famously said, you ain't black if you vote [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1659.26s)]
*  Republican or if you vote for Trump. Now, Trump's basically saying, you ain't Jewish if you vote for [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1665.5800000000002s)]
*  Democrats because of Israel. So what are your forecasts for a second Trump term in terms of [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1671.02s)]
*  Trump's individual proclivities on the issue? Yeah. I mean, if I think [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1679.3400000000001s)]
*  I were completely cynical and all I believed in was power, which seems to be Trump's mentality, [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1684.94s)]
*  then I would say that that's a brilliant ploy to tell Jewish voters in areas where they're [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1692.54s)]
*  heavily concentrated that Trump cares more about Israel than the Democrats do. And for those who [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1702.94s)]
*  vote on the basis of Israel, which most Jews do not, that might be an effective appeal. And you [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1712.06s)]
*  can see Trump is gathering more Jewish support than previous Republican nominees had from that [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1717.4199999999998s)]
*  element, more like religiously observant, religious nationalist Jews. They love Trump. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1723.26s)]
*  So why not do that? I mean, Trump's general strategy is to try to slice off as much as he can [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1731.8999999999999s)]
*  from various minority groups that had been core constituencies for the Democrats. Remember in 2016, [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1739.5s)]
*  Donald Trump made an appeal, an explicit appeal in his own words to the LGBTQ community, and he [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1747.1000000000001s)]
*  could barely read all the letters, but he got the alphabet soup down and he said that I will protect [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1753.9s)]
*  you against Islamic terror because that's the number one threat to your community. So in some, [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1761.02s)]
*  I mean, from a cynical point of view, what he's doing is smart. He's also trying to make sure [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1765.9s)]
*  that he keeps Miriam Adelson, the widow of the late casino baron Sheldon Adelson, whose wealth [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1772.7s)]
*  also sponsored the career of Benjamin Netanyahu in his good stead. So he's got a $100 million [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1780.7s)]
*  pledge from Miriam Adelson's super PAC. So there's no reason to believe- [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1787.66s)]
*  And, Mac, let me interrupt you for a second. Let's pull up the image of Miriam Adelson, [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1790.6200000000001s)]
*  who was spotted in a VIP booth at the Republican convention. There she is. She doesn't, [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1793.98s)]
*  she looked fantastic. Yeah, that's her. And she's- [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1799.42s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that's basically it. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1802.22s)]
*  Ted Cruz, Carrie Lake, and then Glenn Youngkin, the governor of Virginia. So anybody who's anybody [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1803.1000000000001s)]
*  who wants to ascend through Republican party circles obviously wanted to be spotted with [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1810.22s)]
*  Miriam Adelson in her special little booth at the convention. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1814.3s)]
*  And she will direct the money against you, and she will use the money to destroy you. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1818.3000000000002s)]
*  And Sheldon Adelson, as I reported at the Gray Zone, he was a CIA asset. We can assume that he's [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1823.74s)]
*  an Israeli intelligence asset. This is not just Miriam Adelson. She's a front for some of the more [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1829.9s)]
*  powerful elements in the world. And so there's no reason to think that Donald Trump would somehow [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1836.5400000000002s)]
*  decide to make a deal between the Israelis and the Palestinians. We should believe him when he [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1843.02s)]
*  says that he would like to starve Iran, that he would like to cancel diplomacy with Iran. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1849.5800000000002s)]
*  We should believe him. But at the same time, there's a problem, which is that if Donald Trump [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1856.06s)]
*  were president right now, I think these protests against the genocidal assault on Gaza would be [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1861.8200000000002s)]
*  much larger and more energetic because liberal organizations would have sent their constituents [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1870.3s)]
*  out into the street to try to make this bloody war and what has basically been a failed war for [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1876.54s)]
*  the Israelis all about Donald Trump, the same way that they tried to make the Iraq War all about [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1882.22s)]
*  Bush. And when you see Trump joined at the hip with Netanyahu, it's also bad for Netanyahu [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1888.78s)]
*  because Donald Trump doesn't do what Biden and Blinken are doing where they're saying, [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1896.14s)]
*  oh, well, after this war is all over, we're going to work for a Palestinian state and a two-state [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1900.14s)]
*  solution. Trump is content to openly allow Netanyahu to annex the West Bank. And so the [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1907.02s)]
*  fantasy peace process that has always allowed Israel in a much more elegant way to put new [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1913.58s)]
*  facts on the ground, to build more settlements and then blame the Palestinians for not wanting [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1919.82s)]
*  peace is gone. And so he loses the media as well. So I think there's a danger there [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1924.7s)]
*  for Israel in this special relationship when both Trump and Netanyahu are joined at the hip together [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1932.3s)]
*  in office. And who comes after? Another question to consider is, I mean, Netanyahu is isolated [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1940.46s)]
*  right now. He's facing criminal trials, corruption trials. If the war ends and his coalition collapses, [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1947.5s)]
*  everybody knows that. He feels desperate with the Democratic administration in office and would be [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1956.62s)]
*  disappointed if somehow Kamala won, regardless of how pro-Israel and how bought off by AIPAC she is. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1967.58s)]
*  So there's a good chance that Netanyahu could be leaving the scene at some point in the future, [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1978.22s)]
*  in the near future. I mean, he's the longest-serving Israeli prime minister. What comes after Netanyahu? [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1983.74s)]
*  And what comes after Netanyahu is even weaker and more unstable than Netanyahu ever was. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1989.26s)]
*  Netanyahu essentially is Israel right now. And so I think Israel is walking in, is kind of [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=1995.5s)]
*  entering the abyss. And it's in a state of instability politically but economically. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=2003.98s)]
*  It's heavily reliant on its tech industry, which is seeing dwindling investments from foreign [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=2011.66s)]
*  venture capital firms that it depends on. Its population, especially more educated population, [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=2019.3400000000001s)]
*  is leaving. Its population, which is more working class, cannot return to their homes in the north [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=2024.7s)]
*  and the south. They're relying heavily on government subsidies. Its credit has been [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=2030.78s)]
*  downgraded. It's in a real existential crisis. And it has no clear way out of this war where [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=2036.54s)]
*  it's now directly not just facing Hamas and Hezbollah, but also the Houthis. And that could [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=2044.62s)]
*  expand even further. So I think we need to look at this Netanyahu visit as just another day [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=2051.9s)]
*  in the imperial decline, tragic comedic slasher flick that we've been watching for so long. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=2061.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I agree, obviously, with Trump in power. That acts as an accelerant on any organized liberal [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=2070.5400000000004s)]
*  protest movement. So if Trump were the one presiding over the Gaza war for the past nine [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=2077.1000000000004s)]
*  months, you would probably have seen liberal NGOs realize that they can mobilize their resources [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=2081.34s)]
*  to oppose US foreign policy because they could personalize it as about Trump or right-wing [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=2088.7s)]
*  fascism and how there's a commonality between the US and Israel in that regard or whatever else. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=2094.2999999999997s)]
*  But with a democratic power, it does sap that protest activity. So it would have been like the [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=2100.22s)]
*  2020 George Floyd protests, but transferred into an Israel type scenario just because the presence [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=2105.42s)]
*  of Trump really just acts as that fuel to the fire. And Max, you reminded me that tomorrow on [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=2111.82s)]
*  the show, I want to wear my new Trump-themed yarmulke that I received. I was honored to receive [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=2120.94s)]
*  at the Republican convention last week. I think it would really befit the mood of the programming. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=2127.34s)]
*  So thank you for giving that reminder. And with that, Max, I want to thank you for joining us live [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=2134.94s)]

*  Everybody looks good. So Max, nice job as always. And we'll talk again soon. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=2145.34s)]
*  Thank you. Yeah, I apologize for not being in my home studio, but next time. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=2150.46s)]
*  Don't apologize. You have nothing to apologize for, Max. Never. Never give up. Never surrender. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=2157.1s)]
*  All right. All right, Max Blumenthal. Thank you. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRX_zAAE7p4&t=2162.78s)]
