# Joe Biden pardoned Hunter after vowing he wouldn't. What happened to nobody being above the law?
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [December 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiGExJtypCg)
*  Do you see how stupid they think everybody is? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiGExJtypCg&t=0.0s)]
*  The Democrats have been spending two straight years [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiGExJtypCg&t=4.16s)]
*  equating Donald Trump with Adolf Hitler. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiGExJtypCg&t=8.540000000000001s)]
*  One of their main arguments is that, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiGExJtypCg&t=12.0s)]
*  has been for two years, that if Donald Trump wins, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiGExJtypCg&t=14.24s)]
*  he's gonna get into office and abuse the FBI [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiGExJtypCg&t=18.0s)]
*  and abuse the Justice Department [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiGExJtypCg&t=21.34s)]
*  to persecute his political enemies. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiGExJtypCg&t=22.740000000000002s)]
*  He's gonna prosecute his political enemies. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiGExJtypCg&t=24.8s)]
*  They've been accusing him of that since 2016 [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiGExJtypCg&t=27.94s)]
*  when he used to chant Locker Up about Hillary Clinton. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiGExJtypCg&t=30.18s)]
*  And now they're gonna pretend [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiGExJtypCg&t=34.9s)]
*  that it's only within the last four days [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiGExJtypCg&t=36.22s)]
*  that they realize that there's a chance, Joe Biden, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiGExJtypCg&t=38.42s)]
*  that Donald Trump might get into office [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiGExJtypCg&t=40.660000000000004s)]
*  and exploit the Justice Department [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiGExJtypCg&t=44.18000000000001s)]
*  to investigate his political enemies like Hunter Biden. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiGExJtypCg&t=46.38s)]
*  And that's what changed. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiGExJtypCg&t=48.7s)]
*  This is the first time Democrats realized [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiGExJtypCg&t=49.980000000000004s)]
*  that that would happen, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiGExJtypCg&t=51.78s)]
*  which is why they suddenly realized that, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiGExJtypCg&t=52.86s)]
*  oh, Hunter Biden actually does need a pardon from Joe Biden. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiGExJtypCg&t=55.86s)]
*  Now, as I said, as idiotic as that is, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiGExJtypCg&t=59.18s)]
*  as transparently moronic as it is, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiGExJtypCg&t=63.54s)]
*  I can't really criticize someone sent out to defend it [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiGExJtypCg&t=66.3s)]
*  because I can't think of anything else better to say. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiGExJtypCg&t=69.02s)]
*  But this is what's so farcical about all of this. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiGExJtypCg&t=74.36s)]
*  And this is why I wanted to spend as much time as we have [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiGExJtypCg&t=76.78s)]
*  on this Hunter Biden pardon, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiGExJtypCg&t=78.94s)]
*  because this is what Democratic Party rhetoric [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiGExJtypCg&t=81.32s)]
*  has been about for so long. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiGExJtypCg&t=84.26s)]
*  It's been this oozing sanctimony [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiGExJtypCg&t=87.14s)]
*  about how the Democratic Party [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiGExJtypCg&t=90.74000000000001s)]
*  and all of their pre-Trump Republican allies, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiGExJtypCg&t=92.94s)]
*  whatever disagreements they might have had, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiGExJtypCg&t=96.84s)]
*  or all patriots who believe in the rule of law [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiGExJtypCg&t=99.02000000000001s)]
*  as a way of trying to single out Donald Trump [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiGExJtypCg&t=102.30000000000001s)]
*  as some sort of grave and existential unique threat [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiGExJtypCg&t=104.38000000000001s)]
*  to the rule of law and American democracy [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiGExJtypCg&t=108.30000000000001s)]
*  and their main example to demonstrate this [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiGExJtypCg&t=113.34s)]
*  was that Joe Biden won't even pardon his own son [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiGExJtypCg&t=117.06s)]
*  only for him to have turned around so predictably [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiGExJtypCg&t=119.5s)]
*  and have done exactly that. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiGExJtypCg&t=123.74s)]
