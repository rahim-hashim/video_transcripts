# Dems' Push to Oust Biden from the Race; Kamala's Unprecedented Rise to Power with Michael Tracey
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [July 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI)
*  We had planned to interview Ro Khanna. He was apparently on the line. By the way, I'm [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=0.0s)]
*  filling in for Glenn Greenwald, who's away on one of his luxurious holidays, well deserved. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=12.94s)]
*  Unfortunately, Ro Khanna seemed to prematurely abort the interview for not fully explained [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=19.28s)]
*  so hopefully that could be resolved if Congressman Khanna out there is listening or anybody around [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=29.16s)]
*  him is listening. The invitation stands. I was going to conduct a very respectful interview [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=35.08s)]
*  actually and even commend him for being unusually willing among particularly Democratic members of [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=42.400000000000006s)]
*  Congress to do ideologically diverse independent media. So the offer stands. I guess now that we [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=48.24s)]
*  have a bit of time, if the staff are willing, I was just going to go through a little bit of [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=56.0s)]
*  what I was asking him and maybe kind of merge it or transition it into a slight editorial on my part. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=61.2s)]
*  You know, one of the interesting aspects of Kamala Harris being privately coordinated at [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=67.96000000000001s)]
*  rapid speed, the presumptive Democratic nominee, is that as Ro Khanna is probably well aware, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=74.8s)]
*  having been the co-chair of the 2020 Bernie Sanders campaign, Kamala Harris got a grand [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=83.67999999999999s)]
*  total of zero delegates in that race when she ran for the Democratic nomination in 2020. Likewise, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=90.47999999999999s)]
*  she's received zero delegates in 2024, at least on the basis of delegates that are allocated by [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=97.03999999999999s)]
*  popular vote outcome in primary state elections. And so Kamala Harris really just objectively [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=104.24s)]
*  speaking is unprecedentedly being anointed by pure insider machinations with almost no actual [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=110.56s)]
*  voter input. You really have to strain to find even a remotely apt parallel in American history [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=122.24s)]
*  for a major party nominee who receives the nomination without even bothering to attempt [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=130.44s)]
*  to contest the public portion of a nomination contest. People bring up 1968, but for a little [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=135.56s)]
*  bit of a history lesson, Hubert Humphrey, who ended up becoming the Democratic nominee in that [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=142.68s)]
*  year, went on to lose narrowly to Richard Nixon in the general election. He actually did, he was the [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=148.28s)]
*  incumbent vice president at the time under Lyndon Johnson, who withdrew from the race. But even [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=154.92000000000002s)]
*  Hubert Humphrey, who was kind of the party establishment favorite, even he had to go around [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=159.96s)]
*  and contest state conventions that were then one of the primary methods used to apportion delegates [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=165.64000000000001s)]
*  before the advent of the modern primary system. Kamala Harris has done nothing of the kind. She's [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=172.92000000000002s)]
*  been anointed nominee, evidently, over the course of, I don't know, 24, 36 hours without having to [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=179.64000000000001s)]
*  do any public campaigning. It's just been this total dem insider elevation of her without even [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=188.52s)]
*  thinking that maybe they should pause for a second to consult the electorate. So it's rather [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=198.12s)]
*  remarkable. That's one of the things I wanted to ask Ro Khanna about. And we have a clip of Ro Khanna [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=202.92000000000002s)]
*  in New Hampshire in January of 2020 that I was also playing on asking about if we could play that, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=209.96s)]
*  please. Hopefully that can be retrieved, that clip. I was asked, and I'll end with this note, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=216.36s)]
*  I was asked by someone in the press, you know, do they, do people in New Hampshire [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=224.84s)]
*  hold a grudge? Are they upset at the president with the DNC and the first in the primary? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=230.76000000000002s)]
*  I was asked, I mean, the press asked that. And I said, you know what, I don't think you understand [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=237.48000000000002s)]
*  the voters in New Hampshire, because the voters of New Hampshire take their responsibility really [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=242.84s)]
*  seriously. And they're not going to make a decision about who should lead the free world, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=249.0s)]
*  who should lead the United States of America based on whether they agree or disagree on the [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=254.84s)]
*  primary calendar. It's not that parochial. They're looking at who should lead this nation. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=259.32s)]
*  Well, we've got wars in Ukraine, wars in the Middle East, an economy that isn't working for people. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=266.12s)]
*  And they have made the assessment that that person is Joe Biden. And they're putting aside [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=271.32s)]
*  any disagreement to do what is right for the country. That to me is the ultimate form of [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=277.16s)]
*  patriotism. And that's what all of you are doing. By working to have Joe Biden written in, I am [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=282.28000000000003s)]
*  confident because of your efforts, he's going to have a big win. A win is a win, but a win, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=288.36s)]
*  a decisive win, a decisive win on Tuesday. And that's going to propel him to have a big win [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=293.96s)]
*  in November, because at the end of the day, I am a believer that Americans love this country and [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=301.88s)]
*  love our democracy and love and want a positive vision of the future. And then that's going to [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=307.79999999999995s)]
*  work and win over the cynicism and anger that is represented by Donald Trump and the other side. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=312.59999999999997s)]
*  Okay. So as context, that's Ro Khanna speaking in Portsmouth, New Hampshire in January of this [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=319.24s)]
*  year on behalf of what was then called the Right in Biden campaign, because what happened was [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=328.2s)]
*  the DNC, which was effectively under the control of Biden and his surrogates, decided that they [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=334.2s)]
*  were going to upend the primary calendar in 2024 to create the most seamless path to victory for [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=341.24s)]
*  Biden. And because in 2020, Biden was boosted by his performance in South Carolina, what the DNC [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=349.72s)]
*  for this cycle wanted to do is displace New Hampshire, which has traditionally and actually [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=356.68s)]
*  by state statute, by New Hampshire state statute is required to go first in the primary cycle. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=361.56s)]
*  They wanted to do away with that, displace New Hampshire where Biden doesn't perform as well or [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=367.48s)]
*  hadn't in 2020 and put South Carolina first. So what they did was they sent a, the DNC did, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=373.64000000000004s)]
*  again, under the control effectively of Biden, sent to what could only be described as a threat [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=381.48s)]
*  letter, and this could be pulled up as well, to the state Democratic party in New Hampshire, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=387.0s)]
*  where the DNC directed the state party to effectively inform New Hampshire citizens [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=393.8s)]
*  that the election, the New Hampshire primary this year was to be understood as meaningless. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=407.0s)]
*  That's the exact quote in the letter that was sent. But nonetheless, this is what I was going [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=412.68s)]
*  to raise with Ro Khanna. Ro Khanna went to New Hampshire and campaigned on behalf of Biden [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=416.6s)]
*  vis-a-vis this write-in Biden campaign. So even though the official Democratic party apparatus [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=422.92s)]
*  was seeking to negate the Democratic primary in New Hampshire this year, Ro Khanna went [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=428.52000000000004s)]
*  to New Hampshire and was encouraging Democrats to write in Joe Biden because he didn't technically [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=433.72s)]
*  appear on the ballot because the DNC wasn't even recognizing the validity of the election. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=438.76000000000005s)]
*  But Ro Khanna was so committed to promoting Joe Biden at that juncture, in the name of democracy, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=443.32s)]
*  and the well-being of the nation, and all this stuff. He went and was advocating for this write-in [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=449.71999999999997s)]
*  Biden initiative. And he was extolling the virtues of New Hampshire voters by saying, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=456.76s)]
*  look, they take their obligations so seriously, and we ought to rely on their wisdom in choosing [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=463.96s)]
*  how to best express their say in the process for picking the leader of the free world. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=472.68s)]
*  So what I was simply going to ask him, and I think this is a reasonable question, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=477.48s)]
*  if anybody disagrees, I'm open to criticism, including from the congressman. But what I was [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=480.76s)]
*  going to ask him is, New Hampshire and every other state now has zero say, at least in terms [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=487.0s)]
*  of the primary electorates. I mean, no president has ever withdrawn at so late a point in the [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=491.4s)]
*  election cycle as Biden has voluntarily, on his own accord, we were told, with his mysterious [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=500.68s)]
*  letter that he issued over X, which, by the way, wasn't X supposed to have been subverted by right [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=508.44s)]
*  wing disinformation or something when Elon Musk took it over, but that's neither here nor there. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=512.84s)]
*  The point is, Biden had already accumulated about 99% of pledged delegates that are apportioned by [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=518.28s)]
*  the president, and that's the only way to get a primary election outcome in the individual states [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=524.8399999999999s)]
*  and territories. So if the rationale for Ro Khanna going around and campaigning for Biden, at that [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=530.4399999999999s)]
*  point in January, because it was so important for the voters to have their say, how does he react to [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=537.3199999999999s)]
*  the voters having their say effectively obviated by this latest democratic insider push to pressure [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=545.0799999999999s)]
*  to rest? Remember, it was just like 24 hours before that Biden and his operatives were absolutely [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=554.36s)]
*  adamant that he was going to remain in the race. And what does it say that Kamala Harris really [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=559.0s)]
*  stands alone in American history as having been anointed by no voters as a major party nominee? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=567.24s)]
*  It's staggering. And she's without peer in this regard, at least in the modern primary era, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=575.9599999999999s)]
*  which only really began in the 1970s, but even arguably before that, because even when there was [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=583.72s)]
*  more insider maneuvers that led to how primary elections or contests were resolved and nominees [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=588.0400000000001s)]
*  were chosen, there was some semblance of a public process where you had to go around to state parties [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=595.88s)]
*  and jockey with delegates and petition various factions within the party to obtain a majority of [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=601.4s)]
*  delegates. Kamala Harris has barely done any of that, at least not in public. All she apparently [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=610.76s)]
*  did was immediately start getting on the phone, calling up democratic governors and senators. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=616.92s)]
*  The incident that the Biden letter went out on Sunday afternoon, and she's now raking in the cash [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=622.84s)]
*  and everybody thinks that she's such a breath of fresh air, apparently, in the media sectors that [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=630.36s)]
*  were agitating for Biden's ouster because she can go around screeching about abortion, I guess, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=635.8000000000001s)]
*  more capably than Joe Biden. What is Kamala Harris's foreign policy prescriptions? How do [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=641.96s)]
*  they compare with Biden? Do they differ at all? That's one of the questions I was going to raise [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=647.96s)]
*  with Rokana. Seems pretty reasonable to me. Wouldn't you want to know a little bit of [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=651.96s)]
*  information about what a major presidential nominee, major party nominee would do in the [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=657.0s)]
*  domain of foreign affairs? Shouldn't you maybe ask a couple of questions perhaps about what their [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=663.48s)]
*  plans would be in that regard? We have several hot wars raging that the US is deeply operationally [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=668.84s)]
*  and financially and militarily involved in. We know next to nothing about what Kamala Harris's [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=674.52s)]
*  individual prescriptions would be for those conflicts. Now, of course, you can relate her [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=681.64s)]
*  to the Biden administration's record of which she's a member. That's certainly a fair inference [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=688.68s)]
*  to make as to what her future plans would be. But still, I mean, the whole point of a primary [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=693.64s)]
*  process in theory would be that she would have to debate and take questions and go around and [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=697.8s)]
*  present herself to different interest groups, to the media, to all other kinds of interested parties [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=704.92s)]
*  so we can ascertain at least a little bit of what her independent agenda would be, if any. But we [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=712.76s)]
*  have no information in that regard. Nonetheless, the entire punditocracy, the democratic punditocracy [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=719.8s)]
*  has gleefully consolidated around her because, again, I guess they love hearing her [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=726.4399999999999s)]
*  sermonize about abortion because that's all they care about as though the president has [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=730.84s)]
*  unilateral authority over, you know, abortion laws in Oklahoma. I don't know, I mean, I guess [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=734.6s)]
*  these democratic insiders are hoping that Kamala Harris is going to issue an executive fiat and then, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=742.04s)]
*  you know, Alabama and Mississippi and Oklahoma and, you know, South Dakota are all going to have to [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=748.12s)]
*  reinstitute Roe versus Wade era abortion laws or something like that. They don't really work out the [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=754.76s)]
*  precise policy details of what it is that they're so desperate for a president Kamala to do in the [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=761.64s)]
*  realm of abortion. But my point is the president has awesome unilateral authority over the nuclear [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=768.04s)]
*  codes, for instance. The U.S. military is the key or she potentially is the commander in chief. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=775.7199999999999s)]
*  Article two of the constitution endows the president with awesome unilateral powers over [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=783.16s)]
*  a specific issue set, which is, you know, international relations, foreign policy, military, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=789.16s)]
*  etc. And we don't know, you know, virtually anything about what Kamala Harris would be [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=795.32s)]
*  endeavoring to do on her own individual terms apart from what she kind of just subordinately [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=801.08s)]
*  would sign on to as a result of her being the vice president in the Biden-Harris [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=808.36s)]
*  administration. There's another thing I was going to ask Roe Conner. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=812.36s)]
*  Every single democrat, including Roe Conner himself, voted yes on the $61 billion [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=817.88s)]
*  in supplemental appropriations for Ukraine in April, joined by lots of Republicans and, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=824.6s)]
*  by the way, you know, partially executed by Donald Trump, who also signed off on that [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=830.52s)]
*  massive disbursement of monies for Ukraine. So, you know, is the Kamala Harris agenda or the plan [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=835.32s)]
*  to simply be plowing ahead, you know, full speed on the current status quo with regard to Ukraine? [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=841.72s)]
*  How about Israel? Benjamin Netanyahu is going to be, is in the United States this week, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=849.32s)]
*  meeting with whomever. And, you know, one of the plans, supposedly, for the Kamala Harris [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=854.6s)]
*  proponents in the Democratic insider pundit strategist realm was to portray her as perhaps [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=862.7600000000001s)]
*  slightly less vociferous in her support for Israel compared to Biden, because it's created [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=870.44s)]
*  consternation within certain elements of the Democratic activist base, right? But we have no [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=876.92s)]
*  real empirical evidence that she diverges virtually at all from Biden. So that's another, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=882.5999999999999s)]
*  you know, potentially pertinent question to raise with, you know, the nominee who's just been anointed [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=888.36s)]
*  out of thin air, more or less. So that's something that potentially, you know, Roe Conner could have [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=895.56s)]
*  addressed as somebody who is a Democratic member of Congress and is in the mix and all this kind [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=901.48s)]
*  of stuff. Now, those seem like reasonable questions to me. I don't know precisely on what basis he [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=905.24s)]
*  exited the interview. I saw him on the screen over here, so he was definitely here and waiting to be [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=911.32s)]
*  to be interviewed, but he left. So, you know, unfortunate, but what are you going to do? Those [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=916.84s)]
*  are the, sometimes you have to let the chips fall where they may in this industry, to use a bizarre [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=924.76s)]
*  cliche that I just invented on the fly. I guess for now, I will just note that I'm going to be [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=930.36s)]
*  guest hosting for Glenn Greenwald for about another week or so while he's again on his much deserved [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=938.44s)]
*  vacation and probably snickering from a distance at my foibles. So I'm sure he's enjoying that. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=945.5600000000001s)]
*  But so tune in tomorrow and you'll get lots of great content from me, Michael Tracy, who is once [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRMkIajqIxI&t=952.12s)]
