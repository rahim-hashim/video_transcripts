# Post-VP Debate Interview MELTDOWN: "Progressive" Dem Defends Israel
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [October 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc)
*  All right, so as you know after presidential debates or vice presidential debates, they [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=0.0s)]
*  have this thing that has a very rare type of candor for political discourse that's called [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  the spin room. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=17.84s)]
*  And basically surrogates of each party, each candidate, each campaign go there and argue [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=19.56s)]
*  why their candidate was so fantastic and the other one was terrible and they have talking [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=24.28s)]
*  points about what one candidate said and the other one said that was so terrible or so [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=29.54s)]
*  great based on who they're there to hack for. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=34.7s)]
*  And one of the things that we do is send Michael Tracy to these events along with Megan O'Rourke [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=38.1s)]
*  who's a producer and a member of our team. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=44.9s)]
*  It's just an update precisely because those aren't the kind of questions that Michael [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=47.86s)]
*  tries to ask. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=53.099999999999994s)]
*  So we're just going to show you a few of these, the ones we don't get to, though they're [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=55.34s)]
*  very worth watching. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=58.74s)]
*  We're going to put on our locals platforms if you want to see those and you're a member [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=59.74s)]
*  you can if you want to see them and join locals. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=63.1s)]
*  You can do that as well where we have a lot of exclusive content that we don't get a chance [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=66.26s)]
*  to put on the show. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=69.5s)]
*  But here is Michael just giving you a little bit look of a look about what the spin room [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=71.02000000000001s)]
*  actually is. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=76.74000000000001s)]
*  All right, I have to keep my voice down. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=77.74000000000001s)]
*  I don't know why exactly I put it this way. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=84.06s)]
*  It seems like the right thing to do because we're in the CBS network corridors, I guess. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=85.06s)]
*  I kind of want to bust into the Drew Barrymore show set that might be more exciting than [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=92.78s)]
*  watching the vice presidential debate, which might be down that way. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=98.34s)]
*  I think that might be where the debate's happening. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=103.38000000000001s)]
*  The spin room is in here, which we were just kind of walking around there doing some interviews. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=106.10000000000001s)]
*  Help yourself to a beverage of your choice. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=112.76s)]
*  Yeah, this studio, this whole building kind of reminds me of a high school basement or [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=115.84s)]
*  something. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=124.4s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=125.4s)]
*  It's a little bit weird, but hey, we're making the most of it. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=126.4s)]
*  Why are people gathered over there? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=130.68s)]
*  It might be, yeah, go take a look. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=132.56s)]
*  I think it might be people who are like photographers or stuff who are allowed to. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=136.36s)]
*  Yeah, let's not even test our luck. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=143.24s)]
*  I don't want to even get involved. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=146.52s)]
*  I don't want to run afoul of any secret service. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=147.52s)]
*  Yeah, that might be the spray. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=151.28s)]
*  It's like the photographers would go in and take the photos. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=155.64s)]
*  Okay, so there you go. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=158.84s)]
*  Drew Barrymore show, CBS. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=162.72s)]
*  Apparently this is typically where the CBS sports, like NFL and stuff is filmed. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=165.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=172.88s)]
*  I'm just going with the flow. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=173.88s)]
*  All right, goodbye. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=174.88s)]
*  So it's always incredibly entertaining and fulfilling to watch Michael's stream of consciousness [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=177.04s)]
*  observations without any purpose as he did there. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=182.2s)]
*  But actually the reason we like sending Michael so much to these events is because all of [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=185.35999999999999s)]
*  these things run on this very strict protocol. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=189.64s)]
*  There's very strict unwritten rules about how everybody's supposed to conduct themselves, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=191.72s)]
*  what journalists are supposed to do and not do, who they're supposed to ask, what kind [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=197.24s)]
*  of questions they're asking. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=200.52s)]
*  And Michael in part has no idea what any of those are because he just never bothered to [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=203.6s)]
*  learn them. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=210.20000000000002s)]
*  And even if he did know them, he doesn't care about them at all. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=211.20000000000002s)]
*  So it's really just like letting a ball loose in a china shop. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=215.20000000000002s)]
*  And given that the china shop is filled with the worst people on the planet, it's, I think, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=220.07999999999998s)]
*  something always revealing to do. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=226.16s)]
*  So let's show you an interview that he was able to conduct with Jasmine Crockett, which [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=227.72s)]
*  I found very fascinating. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=233.88s)]
*  Jasmine Crockett is a young, I believe she's in her second term, Democratic member of Congress [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=235.96s)]
*  from Texas. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=242.04s)]
*  She's a black woman, so therefore she's often considered to be part of the left wing of [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=243.04s)]
*  the Democratic Party. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=247.68s)]
*  She's known for her very combative, sort of spicy rhetoric about Donald Trump that usually [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=248.68s)]
*  is a little more extreme than what most members of Congress are willing to express about Trump. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=254.0s)]
*  And so she's had this reputation for being sort of a kind of like a Marjorie Taylor Greene [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=259.16s)]
*  type of the Democratic Party. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=263.3s)]
*  And yet Michael decided to ask her not about how great Tim Walz did or how terrible JD [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=265.8s)]
*  chances, but instead about her consistent votes to authorize billions and billions of [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=271.72s)]
*  dollars to fund the Israeli military and to pay for its wars and how that can be reconciled [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=278.92s)]
*  with the values and views she typically claims to believe in. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=286.24s)]
*  The way in which she defended Israel, it basically sounded like he was talking to Marco Rubio. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=291.0s)]
*  Let's watch what happened. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=296.68s)]
*  Congresswoman, Governor Walz started out tonight by repeating this refrain that Israel has [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=297.92s)]
*  a right to defend itself. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=303.40000000000003s)]
*  Israel has just invaded Lebanon. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=305.72s)]
*  Israel is now intimating that it could attack Iran. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=308.44s)]
*  So shouldn't we be looking for a little more than just these platitudes about Israel having [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=313.36s)]
*  a right to defend itself? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=318.94s)]
*  What is the limiting principle, especially when the US, when providing the armaments [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=320.24s)]
*  for Israel to wage these military campaigns, as you know, having voted for the national [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=324.28s)]
*  security supplemental back in April, which underwrote Israel's war effort? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=328.4s)]
*  I absolutely did vote for it. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=332.64s)]
*  I voted for that along with every other supplemental that was available. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=334.08s)]
*  And I will tell you this, it is important that people understand what diplomacy looks [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=338.4s)]
*  like and it looks like the fact that this relationship between Israel and the United [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=342.23999999999995s)]
*  States has existed since before I was born. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=345.67999999999995s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=349.58s)]
*  The relationship will continue on in perpetuity even after I'm gone. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=350.62s)]
*  And so when you look at Israel, I think it is important that people start to talk about [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=354.53999999999996s)]
*  the fact that the state of Israel versus their leadership. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=360.78s)]
*  Because right now, or when I went to Israel, I know that the people were protesting Netanyahu [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=365.18s)]
*  because Netanyahu was reforming the courts. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=371.97999999999996s)]
*  In addition to the fact that Netanyahu was under investigation along with people in his [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=374.09999999999997s)]
*  administration. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=378.86s)]
*  Sound familiar? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=379.86s)]
*  Does it sound like somebody else that you know? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=380.86s)]
*  It sounds like Donald Trump to me, somebody that has reformed our courts, courts that [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=382.54s)]
*  have decided that he now has a level of immunity that he should not be entitled to based on [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=386.86s)]
*  our laws, as well as somebody who is under criminal indictment, as well as somebody who [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=391.1s)]
*  has criminal convictions. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=396.34000000000003s)]
*  And so different people do their votes for different reasons. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=397.98s)]
*  But for me, when I'm looking forward and I'm trying to figure out what is going to happen, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=401.62s)]
*  if for some reason, let's say we say, well, you know what? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=407.46s)]
*  You had your democratic election and we just don't like your leader, so we will leave you. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=411.06s)]
*  Will that give permission to our allies to leave us if, God forbid, Donald Trump come [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=415.38s)]
*  back into power and then they leave us? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=421.94s)]
*  And then that leaves us more insecure. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=424.42s)]
*  So I mean, everybody has their reasons for why they do stuff. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=426.3s)]
*  But I will also tell you this, because the issue today has to do with the fact that Iran [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=429.15999999999997s)]
*  ended up firing missiles over into Israel. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=435.9s)]
*  After Israel invades. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=439.17999999999995s)]
*  OK, I just need to stop it there, even though there's so much more to go, as bad if not [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=440.17999999999995s)]
*  worse. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=446.29999999999995s)]
*  But I just want to break down how incoherent and internally inconsistent everything she [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=447.29999999999995s)]
*  just got done saying there was. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=457.94s)]
*  So the question was Tim Walz defended Israel in the debate and said that they would keep [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=460.82s)]
*  funding Israel for whatever they wanted to do. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=466.7s)]
*  And he said to her, is there any limit on what Israel can do, given that you're one [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=469.86s)]
*  of the people who voted for the supplemental to send billions and billions of dollars to [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=476.86s)]
*  Israel? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=480.46s)]
*  And she began off, she started off by saying, yeah, I did do that. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=481.52s)]
*  I'm happy I did it. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=485.98s)]
*  She had this bizarre rationale that the US-Israel relationship has been like this, but since [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=488.26s)]
*  before she was born and that for some reason it will exist in perpetuity. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=494.02s)]
*  So why should she try and stop it? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=497.42s)]
*  She might as well just go along with it. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=499.53999999999996s)]
*  And it's, I guess, inevitable anyway. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=501.06s)]
*  But her point was to try and say that Benjamin Netanyahu is like Donald Trump. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=504.3s)]
*  And that he, when she went to Israel, was the subject of protest. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=510.53999999999996s)]
*  I don't know if she knows this or not, but the reason Benjamin Netanyahu was the prime [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=517.22s)]
*  minister of Israel is because he was elected democratically. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=521.46s)]
*  He's actually been the prime minister of Israel for the last 20 years with only a little bit [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=525.0600000000001s)]
*  of time off in between the very short spurts where he's not running the country because [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=530.74s)]
*  the Israeli people have chosen to support Netanyahu. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=535.94s)]
*  And while yes, it's true, there are tens of thousands or even a hundred thousand or so [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=541.02s)]
*  people in Tel Aviv protesting Netanyahu's failure to get the hostages back. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=545.18s)]
*  They're not protesting the war in Gaza. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=552.8199999999999s)]
*  There's almost complete unanimity on the part of Netanyahu and the opposition leader and [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=555.18s)]
*  pretty much every party in Israel about the nobility and justification of this. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=561.0999999999999s)]
*  So if you're looking for a reason to oppose funding Israel, then you can cite the fact [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=565.9799999999999s)]
*  that Netanyahu is like Trump. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=571.62s)]
*  We don't support Netanyahu or trust him because he's like Trump. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=573.02s)]
*  But why would you compare Donald Trump to Netanyahu on your way to explaining why you [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=576.92s)]
*  believe that the US should continuously fund what Netanyahu is doing in all of these different [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=582.18s)]
*  countries? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=588.22s)]
*  This obsession with Trump and her ability to understand things only by reference to [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=591.6999999999999s)]
*  him comparing Netanyahu to Trump and then trying to pretend that the people of Israel [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=595.34s)]
*  are these repressed people trying to overthrow the chains that have been imposed on them [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=600.9000000000001s)]
*  by the Netanyahu regime when the reason Netanyahu is prime minister is because they've not only [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=606.86s)]
*  elected him but support his war policies and have done so for a long time along the way [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=612.1400000000001s)]
*  to explaining why she wants to continue to give money to Israel makes no sense. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=617.2s)]
*  The other thing I just want to say is that she's been in Congress for about seven seconds [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=622.5400000000001s)]
*  and of course she has already made one of those official propaganda trips to Israel. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=628.7s)]
*  Is there any member of Congress at all in the United States in the Senate or the House [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=634.1s)]
*  who doesn't very quickly go on one of those trips to Israel where they get instructed [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=639.8000000000001s)]
*  slash indoctrinated slash propagandized about all the things the Israelis want them to believe? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=647.0200000000001s)]
*  Other than maybe Ilyon Omar and Rashid Talib, I don't know if there's a single member of [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=653.38s)]
*  Congress, the 535 people who formed the House and the Senate who haven't gone at least [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=658.28s)]
*  once probably multiple times on these trips to Israel. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=664.56s)]
*  It's like a rite of passage to be a member of Congress in the United States is you have [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=667.1999999999999s)]
*  to go visit Israel. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=670.72s)]
*  She's been there a very short period of time and everything she knows as she says is based [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=673.3199999999999s)]
*  on her visit to Israel. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=677.24s)]
*  So let's hear a little bit more from Congresswoman Crockett about why she's so fervently in favor [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=680.62s)]
*  of arming and funding and financing a country that she says is basically led by a corrupt [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=687.66s)]
*  figure akin to Donald Trump. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=693.78s)]
*  Iran ended up firing missiles over into Israel. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=695.7s)]
*  After Israel invaded Lebanon. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=699.86s)]
*  But is Iran Lebanon? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=701.82s)]
*  Or is Iran... [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=703.82s)]
*  No. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=704.82s)]
*  Okay. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=705.82s)]
*  But this thing, it's a spiraling catastrophe that the Biden administration has nothing [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=706.82s)]
*  to rein in. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=709.36s)]
*  Let's be clear. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=710.36s)]
*  When the attacks, which I will say, everything that happened in Lebanon or the initial attacks, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=712.74s)]
*  at least that was more calculated and it was more, it was specifically intended for who? [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=719.1800000000001s)]
*  For terrorists, correct? [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=727.62s)]
*  I mean these are... [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=729.62s)]
*  You got to clarify what you're saying. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=730.62s)]
*  I don't follow. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=731.62s)]
*  Hezbollah. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=732.62s)]
*  So Israel was attacking Hezbollah, correct? [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=733.62s)]
*  Well, they've done a ground invasion into Lebanon now. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=735.82s)]
*  They have now done one, but to be clear, they were attacking Hezbollah, who is a terrorist [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=738.98s)]
*  organization, correct? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=744.38s)]
*  They've invaded the entire country. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=745.38s)]
*  They bombed Beirut. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=747.02s)]
*  I just need you to be clear. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=748.02s)]
*  Well, they've bombed the country. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=749.02s)]
*  Okay, so... [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=751.02s)]
*  So you think everybody who's been killed in the Israeli bombardments has been Hezbollah? [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=752.02s)]
*  I didn't say that. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=756.02s)]
*  I'm telling you that what I am saying is that at least when Lebanon, we talked about what? [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=757.02s)]
*  They had the pagers, correct? [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=765.7s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=767.46s)]
*  So they were literally more calculated in trying not to do... [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=769.0600000000001s)]
*  Those pages blew up in grocery stores and a little girl was killed. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=772.1800000000001s)]
*  I understand and I'm not disagreeing with it and I want to be clear. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=776.7800000000001s)]
*  No one should ever be okay with war. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=780.46s)]
*  You voted to fund it. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=783.26s)]
*  No, I did not vote to fund war. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=784.26s)]
*  What I voted for... [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=786.7800000000001s)]
*  Yes you did. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=787.7800000000001s)]
*  You voted to supply Israel with armaments that they're using in their prosecution of [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=788.7800000000001s)]
*  the war. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=792.0600000000001s)]
*  Do you understand that we took more than one vote? [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=793.0600000000001s)]
*  Let me ask you, since you know about... [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=794.98s)]
*  I know all about it. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=796.1s)]
*  I follow it very closely. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=797.1s)]
*  Can you tell me about the rest of my votes? [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=798.74s)]
*  On the national security supplemental? [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=799.74s)]
*  Can you tell me about all the votes that we had? [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=800.74s)]
*  Because we had... [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=803.26s)]
*  Yeah, you voted for Ukraine, for the Indo-Pacific, for... [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=804.26s)]
*  Because we had three votes on Israel. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=807.7s)]
*  There have been like a million votes on Israel. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=809.22s)]
*  We had three votes. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=812.08s)]
*  Let me clarify. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=813.66s)]
*  We had three votes as relates to funding for Israel. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=814.66s)]
*  So let me make sure that your record is very clear. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=817.82s)]
*  The very first vote was to fund Israel and defund the IRS because that's what the Republicans [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=820.26s)]
*  put on the floor. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=825.86s)]
*  Because the Republicans run the House. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=827.62s)]
*  Okay? [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=829.62s)]
*  What was my vote? [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=830.62s)]
*  It was a no. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=831.62s)]
*  No. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=832.62s)]
*  But you ultimately voted yes on the bill to fund Israel. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=833.62s)]
*  The second vote was to fund Israel and no other funding. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=835.22s)]
*  Okay? [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=840.02s)]
*  The third vote, was it just for funding Israel or was it also to get money to the people [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=841.02s)]
*  of Gaza? [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=844.94s)]
*  I have a different question. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=845.94s)]
*  And that aid has been consistently blocked. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=848.94s)]
*  I mean you can complain about Netanyahu but he's the one administering the funding that [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=852.22s)]
*  you've said. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=855.74s)]
*  This is about the debate. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=857.62s)]
*  It's that. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=859.62s)]
*  I do. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=864.62s)]
*  I think he was there to deliver on policy. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=865.62s)]
*  It's one of the things that people complained about in the first debate is that they weren't [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=869.1800000000001s)]
*  able to get a lot of policy because there were so many decisions as it relates to Trump [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=873.5s)]
*  and things like that. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=878.14s)]
*  Make sure you get your debate question in. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=881.22s)]
*  Much more relevant. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=882.38s)]
*  I think you'll need to get money. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=884.02s)]
*  I am. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=886.02s)]
*  You interrupted me. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=887.02s)]
*  After a 10 minute diatribe. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=888.02s)]
*  About a foreign policy issue, would you object to that? [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=892.46s)]
*  I also have questions I want to ask about. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=894.9399999999999s)]
*  Alright, I'm sure they'll be fascinating. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=896.9399999999999s)]
*  Not quite as good as the Tammy Duckworth one but giving it a run for its money. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=903.46s)]
*  I love how not only does Michael just go and completely disregard the whole purpose of [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=907.1s)]
*  the stupid spin room, which is where you're supposed to say, who did better? [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=912.4200000000001s)]
*  She's like, clearly Tim Walz. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=917.1s)]
*  He gave a clear, consistent defense of the working class. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=919.1s)]
*  He always ends up fighting with everybody around him too. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=924.22s)]
*  They could object. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=926.94s)]
*  If there's an assistant or a handler who comes in and stops his interview, he'll start trying [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=927.94s)]
*  to interview them. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=932.5600000000001s)]
*  In this case, there were journalists complaining that he was asking questions unrelated to [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=933.5600000000001s)]
*  the debate. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=940.5400000000001s)]
*  Things that were really trivial like, why is she funding with billions of dollars the [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=941.74s)]
*  wars in Israel by Israel that might lead to escalation in the region and they're killing [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=948.8199999999999s)]
*  huge numbers of civilians. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=953.54s)]
*  They're like, no, no, much more important. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=954.54s)]
*  Who do you think did better tonight, Congresswoman? [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=956.3399999999999s)]
*  I just found that amazing because even the Biden White House will at least pay a little [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=961.54s)]
*  bit of rhetorical acknowledgement. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=969.3s)]
*  Oh, that too many people in Gaza, too many innocent Palestinians have been killed, that [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=972.5799999999999s)]
*  Israel has gone too far in certain cases. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=979.3s)]
*  She didn't do any of that. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=981.42s)]
*  I think one of the things that really is important to understand here is that if you're a member [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=983.06s)]
*  of Congress and you look around, you know that being an incumbent is basically a guarantee [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=987.24s)]
*  to be reelected for life. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=993.06s)]
*  The only exception, the only thing that you can do to jeopardize your ability to stay [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=996.94s)]
*  in Congress forever is to step out of line on Israel. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=1002.02s)]
*  Everybody just watched. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=1007.14s)]
*  A pack pour. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=1008.14s)]
*  Millions and millions of dollars, $15 million in one race, $10 million in another to remove [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=1011.26s)]
*  Jamal Bowman from Congress and then remove Cory Bush. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=1014.98s)]
*  Obviously, members of Congress see that and they understand very well what the rule is, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=1018.66s)]
*  the only rule is, which is you don't speak critically of Israel if you want to keep your [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=1024.42s)]
*  job. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=1028.5800000000002s)]
*  Here you have this person who is a young member of Congress representing the supposedly liberal [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=1029.5800000000002s)]
*  wing of the Democratic Party. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=1035.3000000000002s)]
*  Young liberals have been very clear in polling and other ways that they don't want the US [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=1037.6000000000001s)]
*  funding of the Israeli war. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=1043.5800000000002s)]
*  They don't believe there's Israeli. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=1044.7s)]
*  She has no interest in representing any of that. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=1045.8200000000002s)]
*  She just wants to keep her seat and she knows the way to do that is by repeating everything [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=1047.66s)]
*  her one trip to Israel as of now, one in counting. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=1051.8999999999999s)]
*  I'm sure there's going to be a lot more coming. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=1055.1799999999998s)]
*  We're still learning a little bit more about how to speak about this issue. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=1057.4199999999998s)]
*  Anyway, we covered all last night the whole issue of how Iran actually targeted only military [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=1062.06s)]
*  targets, whereas Israel has been flattening apartment buildings and schools and refugee [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=1070.82s)]
*  camps, killing huge numbers of civilians in Gaza for a full year and Beirut for the last [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=1076.4199999999998s)]
*  10 days. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=1081.14s)]
*  But she's here to say that no, actually Israel is incredibly targeted as opposed to the terrorists [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=1082.14s)]
*  in Iran who just bomb indiscriminately. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=1086.74s)]
*  All right, so that's that. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIDlRDJEAc&t=1088.94s)]
