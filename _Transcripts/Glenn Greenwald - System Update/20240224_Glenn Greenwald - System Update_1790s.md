# How Russia Thrived Despite Unprecedented Sanctions
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [February 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM)
*  Professor Siegel, thank you so much for taking the time to be with us tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=0.0s)]
*  It's great to have you. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=10.08s)]
*  Thanks for having me, Glenn. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=11.08s)]
*  Sure. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=14.08s)]
*  So we just went through this kind of several decade old body of research about how sanctions [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=15.08s)]
*  often fail to achieve their stated outcome and at the same time impose all kinds of harms [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=20.64s)]
*  on the countries that we're targeting without any sort of benefit geostrategically to the [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=26.32s)]
*  United States. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=32.24s)]
*  If I know about all this and you're doing work and you're able to presciently warn that [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=33.24s)]
*  Russian sanctions on Russia would be unlikely to change their behavior, clearly a lot of [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=39.04s)]
*  people in Washington know that as well. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  So what is the rationale for this ongoing imposition of sanctions on so many countries, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=45.94s)]
*  including this new round today or this week on Russia? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=50.2s)]
*  It's hard to say, to be honest. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=55.46s)]
*  I mean, a lot of it, some people would say is purely symbolic because most people know [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=56.74s)]
*  that the sanctions don't really work and are not going to work. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=62.1s)]
*  I think there's an important distinction to be made. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=65.18s)]
*  You're making it implicitly and others make it implicitly, but there's a distinction between [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=67.06s)]
*  the political effects of sanctions and the economic effects of sanctions. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=71.02s)]
*  When we say that they don't work, what we mean, and it's not just me, there's a huge [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=74.66s)]
*  academic literature on this and there's a consensus that politically speaking, they [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=79.46000000000001s)]
*  don't work. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=82.82000000000001s)]
*  They cause the target state to change its behavior. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=83.82s)]
*  Economically, they tend to be devastating, but the economic devastation is not supposed [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=86.46s)]
*  to be the goal. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=91.46s)]
*  The economic pressure is supposed to produce a political outcome and that political outcome [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=92.66s)]
*  seems never to materialize. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=97.46s)]
*  In all the cases that you just mentioned from Cuba, I mean, there have been sanctions on [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=99.89999999999999s)]
*  Cuba since the 1950s, Cuba, Iraq, Venezuela, Iran, North Korea, and the list goes on. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=102.5s)]
*  I had actually argued that the sanctions on Russia not only were they not working politically, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=112.06s)]
*  but they were counterproductive and were causing Russia to become more antagonistic. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=115.38s)]
*  This I wrote actually before the Russian invasion of Ukraine. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=121.06s)]
*  I think it's important to note that the US sanctions on Russia did not begin two years [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=124.10000000000001s)]
*  ago. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=130.02s)]
*  That's the common framing now in the media. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=132.26s)]
*  The sanctions on Russia started in 2014 under Barack Obama and they were continued under [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=135.26s)]
*  Donald Trump and they now obviously ratcheted up significantly after 2022 after the full [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=140.66s)]
*  scale invasion of Ukraine. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=145.86s)]
*  But the US sanctions on Russia began after Russia annexed Crimea in March 2014. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=147.9s)]
*  So we're nearing the 10 year anniversary. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=157.34s)]
*  At the time, this was seen as a radical kind of US move and it was pretty clear after a [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=161.58s)]
*  few years that they were not changing Russian behavior. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=166.78s)]
*  The stated objective at that time was to get Russia to withdraw from Crimea and give [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=168.86s)]
*  up its territorial ambitions there. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=173.46s)]
*  Obviously Russia did not do that. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=176.5s)]
*  In 2018, former Ambassador Daniel Fried, who was an architect of these sanctions under [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=178.14000000000001s)]
*  the Obama administration, was taking questions at a Senate hearing and defended the sanctions [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=183.46s)]
*  as working based on the logic that even though Russia was not withdrawing from Crimea, it [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=189.74s)]
*  preventing Russia from taking more aggressive measures that it otherwise would take if sanctions [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=195.62s)]
*  were not in place. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=201.01999999999998s)]
*  And he specifically said that if we had not imposed sanctions on Russia, they would have [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=203.06s)]
*  invaded Ukraine and conquered all of Ukrainian territory. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=206.82s)]
*  That was in 2018. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=210.85999999999999s)]
*  What's happened? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=212.57999999999998s)]
*  Sanctions were continued under the Trump administration. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=214.01999999999998s)]
*  It clearly did not prevent Russia from invading Ukraine in 2022. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=218.26s)]
*  Now the United States has ratcheted up those sanctions. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=223.01999999999998s)]
*  There's enormous sanctions on Russia at this point. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=225.1s)]
*  And as you said, it seems to be having not only is having no political effect, but I [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=228.14s)]
*  think actually what's really interesting and novel is that they're also having no economic [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=231.98s)]
*  impact. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=238.18s)]
*  That's different from other cases of sanctions. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=239.18s)]
*  Russia has been able to very skillfully navigate through these sanctions, building new trade [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=241.98s)]
*  alliances with China and India, Iran, basically the BRICS countries. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=249.42s)]
*  It's getting off the dollar. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=254.1s)]
*  It's separating itself from the US financial system, and it's still able to survive. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=255.42s)]
*  Its oil revenue remains the same. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=259.42s)]
*  Its economy, as you noted, the IMF actually predicts that Russia's economy is going to [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=262.86s)]
*  grow by 2.6 percent in 2024. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=268.42s)]
*  That would make it the leading country in all of Europe. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=271.65999999999997s)]
*  And when the sanctions were first imposed in 2022, I mean, after the full scale invasion [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=276.9s)]
*  We were told that the Russian economy was going to collapse. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=281.06s)]
*  A lot of those same people are now saying, oh, yeah, Russia's economy is growing, but [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=284.78s)]
*  the only reason it's growing is because it's spending so much on the military. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=289.34s)]
*  And the rationale of the sanctions was precisely so that Russia was not going to be able to [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=292.86s)]
*  spend money on the military. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=297.06s)]
*  It's like the logic of the experts is constantly being rewritten. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=298.26s)]
*  And it's pretty clear, actually, what all of this means is that the United States is [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=304.21999999999997s)]
*  losing its economic influence and is not able to shape the events at a global level, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=307.98s)]
*  as it has been able to do since the end of the Cold War. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=313.90000000000003s)]
*  The United States really started relying heavily on sanctions after the collapse of the Soviet [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=317.62s)]
*  Union because it was it was a very easy way to go around the world and sort of exert its [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=322.34000000000003s)]
*  strength. But here it's pretty clear it's like not having very much influence at all. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=326.78000000000003s)]
*  So I do want to ask you about and explore that question of whether this kind of [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=332.86s)]
*  multipolarity is really here, whether the BRICS Alliance is actually providing now a [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=336.54s)]
*  formidable alternative to a lot of these countries who I think are driven by a lot of [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=341.54s)]
*  resentment over the idea that the United States can just dictate to the world who can trade [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=345.66s)]
*  with them and who can't whenever the United States feels displeased with some of their [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=349.38s)]
*  actions. There's a lot of kind of resentment driving the emergence of this alternative [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=352.94s)]
*  coalition. But just to make, I guess, the best case for the sanctions regime that I [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=356.74s)]
*  can in order to hear your argument against it. I think the argument is that even if it doesn't dislodge [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=361.90000000000003s)]
*  the government from power, that what it ends up doing is it ends up significantly impeding [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=368.90000000000003s)]
*  the lives of the people who wield the most amount of power in those countries, the wealthiest [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=374.38s)]
*  people, the elites, the oligarchs. Just this week, for example, at Brazil, as kind of an illustrative [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=379.06s)]
*  example, the Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov was visiting Brazil and he originally [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=383.78000000000003s)]
*  went to Rio de Janeiro for a G20 meeting where he happened to be in the same room with Secretary [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=388.9s)]
*  of State Blinken where Blinken came. They didn't talk, but they were one of a very few [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=394.78s)]
*  number of officials in the same room with the mayor of Rio de Janeiro. And when the [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=398.9s)]
*  foreign minister, the Russian foreign minister was scheduled to then travel to Brasilia to [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=404.78s)]
*  meet with President Lula da Silva, he couldn't get gasoline for his plane, for the Russian [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=408.9s)]
*  plane because the providers of aircraft fuel in Brazil are all tied to the US economy and [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=414.02s)]
*  we're concerned about the ramifications that they've sold fuel to the Russians. And so [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=421.18s)]
*  Lula dispatched a government plane, a military plane to take Lavrov to Brasilia. But it's [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=426.65999999999997s)]
*  kind of an example of how a lot of the people in Russia, the political officials, the elites, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=431.7s)]
*  the kind of oligarchs who used to travel to Western Europe and now have had their assets [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=437.58s)]
*  seized or have had their lives impeded, that that kind of pressure is supposed to foster [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=442.14000000000004s)]
*  behavioral change. That was what you addressed in your article. Why doesn't that work? I [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=447.26000000000005s)]
*  mean, it does seem like those impediments are real, at least in some instances. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=451.5s)]
*  Right. Logically, it seems like those sanctions should have worked. And by that, I mean, if [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=456.22s)]
*  you go back to 2014, the sanctions that the United States first imposed on Russia are [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=461.98s)]
*  what are called targeted sanctions that weren't intended to affect the broader Russian economy. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=465.74s)]
*  They were really designed to target Putin's closest allies and officials in the Russian [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=470.54s)]
*  government to make them bear a personal cost in the ways that you've just described by [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=475.02000000000004s)]
*  freezing assets or making it very difficult to access their wealth that they have stored [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=480.62s)]
*  in European and American banks. And the logic is that these are the people that Putin relies [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=484.86s)]
*  on to stay in power. I think that's actually true. That underlying truth, that's correct. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=490.58000000000004s)]
*  Putin does rely on these very wealthy oligarchs to stay in power. And Putin is supposed to [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=494.90000000000003s)]
*  understand the politics of those people having serious grievances. He's supposed to therefore [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=500.06s)]
*  change Russian policy to appease them. But it simply has not had that effect. Putin was able [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=507.58s)]
*  to do various kinds of things by using the levers of the state and using credits and subsidies and [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=514.54s)]
*  tax policies and incentivizing a lot of oligarchs to bring their money back into Russian banks. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=520.38s)]
*  One of the paradoxical effects of those sanctions, those targeted sanctions in 2014, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=526.38s)]
*  is that Russia had a huge inflow of capital. I mean, oligarchs were moving all of their money [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=530.78s)]
*  out of European and American banks and were recapitalizing the Russian banking system. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=535.5s)]
*  Russia's banks actually, just as another piece of evidence of how badly these sanctions work [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=541.42s)]
*  economically, Russian banks just posted their largest ever profits this year. The money of [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=546.2199999999999s)]
*  the oligarchs is now basically being protected by the Russian state. And I would say there is more [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=554.38s)]
*  of an alliance between the Russian oligarchs and Vladimir Putin than there was before the [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=559.6600000000001s)]
*  sanctions started. So they're having a counterproductive effect. I mean, there was [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=565.1800000000001s)]
*  an article in Bloomberg that stated this very bluntly. It was from 2017 or 18 that said, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=570.0600000000001s)]
*  the sanctions are bringing Russia's oligarchs right into Putin's arms. They're consolidating [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=575.34s)]
*  the state elite there. And I think before this, a lot of Russian oligarchs, I mean, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=580.14s)]
*  they were internationalists. They were bringing their money all over the world. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=584.86s)]
*  They had incentives not to keep it in Russia, of course, because the rule of law is not very strong [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=588.14s)]
*  there. And now the opposite is true. I think they feel vulnerable to European and American power, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=591.42s)]
*  and they have an incentive to work more with the Russian state and keep their assets inside Russia. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=598.62s)]
*  Yeah. There were Russian oligarchs like the brothers who founded the encrypted app, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=603.5s)]
*  Telegram, who then also founded the Russian Facebook, who got driven out of Russia for not [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=609.98s)]
*  turning over data. And they had their wealth trifled with. I mean, they're certainly doing [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=614.4599999999999s)]
*  perfectly fine. But there have been other instances of Russian billionaires being expelled [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=618.86s)]
*  or having their wealth seized. So there did seem to be an incentive that has now backfired, as you [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=624.3s)]
*  said. But beyond the economic component that you just very adeptly laid out, I think one of the [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=628.62s)]
*  things that has alarmed people or left a lot of people confused, and I may even count myself [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=635.74s)]
*  among them, is the fact that we spend almost a trillion dollars a year on our military. And we [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=639.5s)]
*  have done everything possible to try and get artillery into the hands of the Ukrainians, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=647.42s)]
*  and not just us, but all of our NATO allies, everyone in Europe has done the same. And somehow, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=651.5s)]
*  under this supposedly very intensive sanctions regime that we were told we're going to make the [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=658.38s)]
*  Russians run out of bullets, I remember being told that in April and May and June of 2022, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=664.06s)]
*  the Russians have wildly outproduced all of NATO, including the United States, when it comes just [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=669.5s)]
*  to the mere production of artillery, a major reason that they're winning the war, along with [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=675.02s)]
*  drones and other things. How have they been able to do that? How have they been able to manufacture [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=678.2199999999999s)]
*  and produce so much more military equipment than even the wealthiest and most militarized country [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=683.9s)]
*  in history, which is the United States? Well, first of all, Russia has a huge arms industry. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=690.78s)]
*  They're quite good at making weapons. The problem is that the sanctions were supposed to restrict [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=696.6999999999999s)]
*  their ability to get important imports into their weapons manufacturing. And they've been able to [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=702.06s)]
*  get around this quite easily, actually. They've just started importing all of those products from [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=707.5799999999999s)]
*  China, for one. That's one major… I mean, that's basically why the sanctions are not working. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=711.5799999999999s)]
*  China is basically providing Russia with everything that it needs. Russian imports from China have [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=716.4599999999999s)]
*  skyrocketed. Its imports from Europe and the United States have plummeted, and China's made [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=721.74s)]
*  up most of the difference. In addition, Russia has worked a lot with the states of Central Asia and [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=726.38s)]
*  the Caucasus, to a slightly lesser extent Turkey, and has basically found buyers in those states to [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=733.1800000000001s)]
*  import these goods from both Europe and the United States. So, for example, they'll be imported into [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=741.42s)]
*  Kyrgyzstan, and then Kyrgyz businesses will export them to Russia, completely skirting [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=747.5s)]
*  the restrictions. So, in other words, Russia actually is still able to get a lot of inputs [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=755.1s)]
*  from the West. I actually read a report… I don't know if… It's just almost anecdotal, but [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=758.86s)]
*  the Russian weapons that have been recovered on the battlefield still are… 98% of the components [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=765.9s)]
*  are still from Western sources. I also read a report recently… British exports to Russia [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=771.5s)]
*  plummeted by 75% after the sanctions after 2022, but its exports to Uzbekistan went up by the same [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=777.98s)]
*  amount, and Uzbek exports to Russia went up. So, it's like all of the product is just moving through [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=784.54s)]
*  other places. And honestly, Russia has been politically and diplomatically adept at navigating [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=790.3s)]
*  through this. China and India are huge counterweights to the United States. And this [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=798.06s)]
*  is why I do think this marks… I mean, I hate to make such bold statements, really, but it [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=802.2199999999999s)]
*  potentially marks a huge change in geopolitics, where you do see this transformation happening, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=809.18s)]
*  where the economic power of China and India and the BRICS as a block really does seem to be [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=814.38s)]
*  undermining the power of the United States and Europe. Again, politically, the sanctions [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=820.6199999999999s)]
*  probably would have never worked anyway, but economically even, Russia is basically able to [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=826.22s)]
*  get around them. There's almost no discernible impact of the sanctions economically in Russia, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=830.7s)]
*  as you… like in the case of Venezuela or Iran, as you described earlier, you just don't see that [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=835.1800000000001s)]
*  in Russia. Stores are full, people have consumer products. I mean, there's some inflation, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=841.5s)]
*  but it's… I mean, the economy does have… like every other economy, there are problems, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=848.22s)]
*  but it's not… I just spoke to somebody in Moscow today and there's no discernible change [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=851.82s)]
*  in everyday life and the economy there. One of the obviously specialties that you have [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=857.1s)]
*  as a scholar and academic is the former Soviet states, which of course include Ukraine. So I [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=861.6600000000001s)]
*  just want to ask you, there's of course a protracted debate in the United States about [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=867.34s)]
*  what caused the invasion in 2022 of Russian troops into Ukrainian territory. Obviously, there's been a [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=872.3000000000001s)]
*  raging civil war of Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine against the central government [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=879.42s)]
*  in Kiev and the like, but obviously a big escalation when Russian troops in this number invade [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=884.86s)]
*  Ukraine. And obviously, some people say, well, it's because Putin just, I guess, out of the blue [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=889.9s)]
*  became a bad man, sort of like a Hitlerian figure. I don't think it's a very serious theory, but a [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=894.4599999999999s)]
*  lot of people are convinced of that in the United States. Others say that he suddenly has [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=898.4599999999999s)]
*  territorial ambitions to conquer Ukraine, to conquer all of Ukraine. And then of course, others say, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=902.62s)]
*  that it was at least in part a defensive act against provocative acts by NATO in the United States [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=908.94s)]
*  to threaten this very sensitive part of the Russian border with NATO expansion and other kinds of [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=915.1800000000001s)]
*  interference in Ukraine. What is your view on that overall question of what finally led Putin and [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=919.82s)]
*  the Russians to invade on this level in February of 2022? Yeah, that's a great question. I won't [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=925.6600000000001s)]
*  claim that I know the answer. And I think one of the reasons why I think that this happened is [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=931.5s)]
*  because there are so many reasons for Russia to do it. So there's probably some truth to all of [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=936.3s)]
*  the different causes that have been discussed. But I happen to put a lot of weight on Russia's [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=942.3s)]
*  concerns about NATO expansion. And the reason for that is there's a pretty long and well-documented [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=948.94s)]
*  history of Russia speaking out against NATO expansion, explaining very, very clearly, and I'd [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=955.1800000000001s)]
*  say even politely in its diplomacy over the course of 20 years, that it finds NATO expansion [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=960.22s)]
*  to be threatening, that it would prefer that there wasn't NATO expansion, that it would like to work [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=967.1800000000001s)]
*  closer with NATO. And then of course, most famously in 2008, when George W. Bush opened the door to [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=972.46s)]
*  Ukraine and Georgia, I mean, Lenin or Putin said at the time, this is a red line. This is a major [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=978.5400000000001s)]
*  threat to Russian security. The other possible cause is, let's say, the heightened Russian [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=983.74s)]
*  ethno-nationalism and its desire to reunite with the ethnic Russian people in Ukraine or protect [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=991.1800000000001s)]
*  ethnic Russians in eastern Ukraine. There's something to those. I mean, that's real. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=998.3s)]
*  And certainly the Russian public, I think, there's an emotional appeal to the Russian public for those [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1006.78s)]
*  reasons, and those reasons are probably real, but you don't see decades-long insistence by the [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1011.82s)]
*  Russian leaders that this is very important. And to me, that helps break out from the news cycle [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1017.6600000000001s)]
*  context. And if you just think about it historically and pay attention to what Russia's been saying, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1023.9000000000001s)]
*  it seems like NATO expansion is a huge part of it, if not, again, in my view. I know you've had [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1031.02s)]
*  John Mearsheimer on the show many times, and I mostly agree with him on this issue. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1036.94s)]
*  So let me ask you a little bit about internal Russian politics, something we think we learn [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1041.66s)]
*  very little about in the West because it's so much propaganda, and it's hard to discern [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1046.78s)]
*  truth from propaganda. In 2008, there was this memo written by the current CIA director, [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1054.7s)]
*  Bill Burns, to Condoleezza Rice and other Bush officials who were proponents of NATO expansion, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1061.66s)]
*  in which he basically said what you just said, which is that not only for Putin, but essentially [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1067.18s)]
*  everybody in Moscow, including Putin's liberal opponents and critics, the idea of NATO expansion [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1071.9s)]
*  into Ukraine is a red line. It's not just for Putin. It's for pretty much the entire political [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1078.22s)]
*  class in Russia, including Putin's political opposition. This week, of course, there was a [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1081.98s)]
*  ton of attention paid to the death of Alexei Navalny. I think a lot of people ended up being [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1086.8600000000001s)]
*  surprised to learn that at least in his past, if not his present, he had a kind of political [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1091.1s)]
*  ideology that to the Western and American ear sounds very, I guess you could say fascist, [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1095.58s)]
*  very kind of shocking statements about how he views Muslims and other non-white people in Russia [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1104.9399999999998s)]
*  of being subhuman, the need to exterminate them, some of these ads that he did. There were people [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1111.6599999999999s)]
*  in 2019, 2020, 2021 describing Navalny as kind of more extremist or more nationalist or more to [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1116.78s)]
*  what we would, if you want to impose the left or right framework on Russia, more to the right, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1122.78s)]
*  but far right certainly than Putin is. And I think a lot of Americans want to believe that there's [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1127.18s)]
*  this Russian opposition that's just very liberal, very pro-Western, very similar libertarian rising [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1131.98s)]
*  up against Putin. What do you make as best you can of the nature of Russian's internal politics, [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1137.02s)]
*  the extent and nature of whatever opposition there is to Putin's rule? [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1144.62s)]
*  Yeah, that's a great question. The simple answer is that what we would call liberalism, let's say [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1152.3s)]
*  pro-Western, pro-democratic forces in Russia have simply been decimated. And a large reason for that [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1157.7399999999998s)]
*  is the legacy of the 1990s. The liberal parties of Russia basically were the leading, the parties [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1165.58s)]
*  that led the path towards the post-Soviet transition were in power under Yeltsin, [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1171.66s)]
*  led the transition to capitalism, the transition to democracy, and the policies of the 1990s were [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1177.3400000000001s)]
*  absolutely disastrous for ordinary Russian people. I mean, it's just undeniable. And as a result, [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1182.46s)]
*  the liberal parties of Russia have just lost, I mean, they've just lost power. They're just not [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1189.42s)]
*  popular. I mean, they really, the devastation of the 1990s really undermined the liberal movement [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1195.42s)]
*  and liberal parties of Russia. And they were never that popular to begin with. But that's just the [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1201.5s)]
*  reality. If I could just interrupt there, because it's not intuitively obvious why that would be [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1207.5800000000002s)]
*  true. You know, there was, I guess the narrative is that what ended up happening was with the [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1213.3400000000001s)]
*  United States and Yeltsin, there was kind of this austerity and this neoliberalism imposed on Russia. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1218.6200000000001s)]
*  There was a lot of corrupt privatization that made a ton of people very, very rich at the expense of [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1224.54s)]
*  pretty much everybody else. Why would those events cause a decline in popularity for the liberal [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1229.42s)]
*  parties, which oftentimes benefit when people are angry about austerity and neoliberalism and the [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1236.3s)]
*  like? Well, they were the parties that were carrying out these exact policies. So the, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1241.26s)]
*  when I say liberal parties, I mean, these were the parties carrying out the privatization, [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1246.94s)]
*  rapid privatization. And these were the parties sponsoring the loan for shares and the, basically [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1251.26s)]
*  the theft of state property. All at the same time, you know, ordinary people didn't have [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1257.26s)]
*  savings because the Soviet economy was basically a non-money economy. And people lost their [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1262.54s)]
*  pensions. They had no, you know, there were serious hardships. There was almost a generation of [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1268.3s)]
*  people that really had a significantly reduced standard of living. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1274.94s)]
*  And honestly, it's really under Putin that one of the reasons that Putin became popular is he [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1280.94s)]
*  really led Russia out of this era and sort of re-established some semblance of a more normal [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1287.26s)]
*  standard of living. In the context of Russian politics, the reality is there just isn't a [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1292.94s)]
*  strong liberal opposition. You know, there was Boris Nemtsov before. Again, he was a pretty [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1303.1000000000001s)]
*  popular figure, but he was not, it's still fairly marginal. I mean, Putin is extremely popular, [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1308.86s)]
*  even right now. Even if they had free and fair elections, there's a very good chance he would [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1314.3799999999999s)]
*  win. Now, of course, there has been a very, very heavy hand against other opposition leaders, [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1319.8999999999999s)]
*  but Alexei Navalny was, even at the height of his popularity, was, you know, he was relatively [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1325.4199999999998s)]
*  popular among urban, mostly younger people, educated people, urban people who were better off. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1331.1799999999998s)]
*  He had very, very little following in Russia's rural areas, which are dominant. You know, [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1337.82s)]
*  Vladimir Putin carries the rural regions of Russia, the less educated population. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1342.86s)]
*  But even Alexei Navalny, as you started to indicate, he's not really a liberal in the [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1349.02s)]
*  sense that we would understand in the West. He was an ethno-nationalist. In the 2008 war between [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1353.4199999999998s)]
*  Russia and Georgia, Alexei Navalny went far more extreme than Vladimir Putin did at the time. At [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1361.98s)]
*  the time, this was one of the first war, like Russian wars, where the West, people in the West [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1368.8600000000001s)]
*  were outraged that Russia was invading another country. Alexei Navalny, at the time, if I remember, [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1373.26s)]
*  actually called for the expulsion of Georgian citizens from the Russian Federation. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1378.06s)]
*  He, you know, and Vladimir Putin is, by comparison, much more of a pluralist, [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1383.82s)]
*  especially at that time. I think he's less so now. But, and I don't mean to, I certainly don't want [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1389.26s)]
*  to sound like I'm defending Vladimir Putin, but I think within the context of Russian politics, [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1395.5s)]
*  the liberal parties or the pro-Western parties have done a lot to undermine themselves. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1402.06s)]
*  I will say, you know, just, I do want to add, just for the sake of some balance here, I mean, [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1406.3799999999999s)]
*  Alexei Navalny, I think he was, he was, he was not, he's not the kind of hero that he's made out to [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1411.02s)]
*  be in the West. But I do think the guy had a lot of guts. I mean, he really did stand up. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1415.66s)]
*  Absolutely. Oh, for sure. I mean, he went back to Russia knowing what his fate was likely to be, [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1418.3000000000002s)]
*  and there's no taking that away from him. Yeah, absolutely. So I don't want to... [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1422.7s)]
*  No, no, for sure. For sure. I just wanted to get it, you know, I think everyone can recognize that. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1427.3400000000001s)]
*  And I think it, you know, it is impressive. I think when people sacrifice for a cause, [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1431.98s)]
*  independent of what you think of their cause, you have to admire that, just like on a kind of [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1435.9s)]
*  personal level. That level of physical and moral courage, I think, is rare. But I think also it's [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1439.74s)]
*  important to distinguish propaganda from reality. I mean, just in general, that's a good thing to do. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1444.06s)]
*  Let me ask you one last question. I could ask questions for a lot longer than that. And we, [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1449.58s)]
*  or we'd love to have you back on. Obviously, Russia is a very important country, more so than [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1454.54s)]
*  ever in the United States, because of how much focus there is on it, the attempt to blame it. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1458.78s)]
*  Let me ask you about the last couple of decades of the US, or the Russian-Western relationship, [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1463.1799999999998s)]
*  the Russian-US relationship. Putin loves to emphasize, and he did so again in this recent [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1468.86s)]
*  interview that he did with Tucker Carlson, that there was part of the history between the US and [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1475.26s)]
*  Russia where he thought that the Russians could actually integrate into the West, almost to the [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1481.34s)]
*  point of even joining NATO. Maybe that wasn't really a serious proposal, kind of just more symbolic. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1486.9399999999998s)]
*  But certainly, if you listen to the statements of US presidents, starting with Clinton going to [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1491.9799999999998s)]
*  Bush, who famously said he looked into the eyes and the soul of Vladimir Putin and think he's a [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1496.46s)]
*  good person. Obama talked a lot about how he didn't want to confront Russia. He thought there [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1499.98s)]
*  were ways that the US and the Russians could work together in places like Syria, where they had [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1505.26s)]
*  common enemies, and facilitating the Iran deal. He certainly didn't want to confront Putin over [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1509.42s)]
*  Ukraine or Syria. He didn't think it was worth it. Obviously, Trump ran on a platform of [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1515.5s)]
*  federal relations with Russia. How much of an opportunity was there really that has been [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1519.9s)]
*  disquandered by whichever side you want to assign the most blame to? But how much of an opportunity [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1525.66s)]
*  was there really from the perspective of Putin, the willingness and inclination of Putin, to have [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1531.1000000000001s)]
*  much more constructive relationships with the United States and the West than Russia ended up having? [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1536.7s)]
*  Yeah, that's a great question. There's plenty of blame to go around. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1543.5800000000002s)]
*  I think one very important episode that is not well appreciated or understood in the United States [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1547.1s)]
*  is that after September 11th, Russia and the United States had entered a rocky patch in the [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1553.8999999999999s)]
*  late 1990s with the NATO bombing of Serbia, which was a Russian ally. Of course, the fact that that [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1559.1s)]
*  bombing was carried out by NATO, which Russia saw as an anti-Russian force in an offensive military [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1565.26s)]
*  campaign made Russia very unhappy. But after September 11th, Vladimir Putin, he was the first [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1569.98s)]
*  foreign leader to call George W. Bush, and they had already had a very good relationship. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1578.46s)]
*  There's a book by Peter Baker that documents a lot of this. They really were looking toward [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1585.02s)]
*  cooperating in this post-911 world because Russia had all these concerns about terrorism in Chechnya, [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1590.22s)]
*  and now the United States was going to be focusing on Afghanistan. There was a lot in common, [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1596.78s)]
*  a lot of security interests in common. Vladimir Putin was talking about the U.S.-Soviet alliance [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1601.26s)]
*  during World War II. That's what some of the thinking was. He actually offered George W. Bush, [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1606.62s)]
*  he offered to help him establish U.S. military bases in Central Asia, which was a part of the [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1614.86s)]
*  Soviet Union. I'm talking about post-Soviet Central Asia and Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan, [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1620.06s)]
*  areas where the United States basically had no relations at all, almost no influence. They'd [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1623.34s)]
*  only been independent for a decade at that point. The U.S. turned him down, actually. I think the [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1628.78s)]
*  reason for that had a lot to do with Cold War-era mindset among the leaders of the American [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1638.62s)]
*  government at that time. The George W. Bush cabinet was made up of a lot of Cold War hawks. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1645.1799999999998s)]
*  They told Vladimir Putin, we'll establish military bases there. We don't need your [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1650.86s)]
*  cooperation. We don't want you to think that we have to rely on you to do it. This is quite [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1656.78s)]
*  almost explicitly what they said. They really pushed him to the side and made a very forceful [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1661.82s)]
*  effort to establish bases there without Putin's approval or support. This was on top of, at that [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1668.6999999999998s)]
*  time, the United States advancing its missile defense program, which meant eliminating the [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1674.86s)]
*  Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which the United States basically tore up unilaterally in, I think, [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1680.9399999999998s)]
*  the same year, 2001, and all these other measures that really were very difficult for the Russians [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1684.6999999999998s)]
*  to accept on top of NATO expansion happening simultaneously. I don't know that I can explain [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1691.82s)]
*  why the United States took these positions other than some combination of Cold War-era hawkishness [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1700.3s)]
*  among the foreign policy establishment and also a neoconservative sort of, there was that famous [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1707.5s)]
*  idea of the unipolar moment that because Russia was kind of down, the United States had this [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1712.62s)]
*  opportunity to remake the entire world and establish itself as the only significant power [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1718.1399999999999s)]
*  while it had the opportunity to do so. I really think the United States bears more of the [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1727.26s)]
*  responsibility for no other reason than it was the more powerful actor and could have made [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1732.46s)]
*  concessions to Russia in the interest of having a more fruitful partnership. It just obviously has [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1737.1000000000001s)]
*  not gone in that direction. Stephen Cohen, the famous historian, has been, well, he's passed [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1744.22s)]
*  away now, but he was saying even, I think, as early as 2008 that there was a new Cold War. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1748.8600000000001s)]
*  I was very prescient. I think that's very clearly the case now. I think nobody would [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1755.5s)]
*  disagree with that. Absolutely. Unfortunately, I think we're no denying that. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89WXfCV8tM&t=1759.1s)]
