# Glenn Greenwald vs. Christopher Rufo: The Limits of Constitutional Freedoms
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [May 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU)
*  You know, it's interesting, when I was thinking about how to do this, how to conduct our discussion, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=0.0s)]
*  the issues that we discussed, even though it was just a few tweets, were so far reaching [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=13.52s)]
*  and kind of complex that I had so many things I wanted to talk to you about, so the hard [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=17.7s)]
*  part was figuring out what to kind of focus on. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=21.76s)]
*  And there was a series of tweets that you posted in response to that interview I had [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=25.68s)]
*  given in Reason, where I basically said, and it was part of a larger conversation, I was [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=31.12s)]
*  asked specifically about you and I said, basically I think you're very shrewd and influential [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=36.58s)]
*  and successful operative and journalist, but to me it seems like you've gotten to the point [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=41.18s)]
*  where you care more about this kind of Machiavellian quest for power than you do about principles. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=46.08s)]
*  And in response you said this, this is absurd Glenn Griewald, I have advanced a consistent [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=51.76s)]
*  set of principles this entire time. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=56.599999999999994s)]
*  The problem is that many quote, classical liberals believe that anyone who doesn't share [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=59.36s)]
*  their principles have no principles at all. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=64.08s)]
*  It is a form of parochialism and ideological blinder. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=66.56s)]
*  The American tradition is much broader than post-war civil libertarianism. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=70.3s)]
*  The philosophy of the founding is not the same as the ideology of the 1960s ACLU. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=74.94s)]
*  Before criticizing others as unprincipled, one might consider that there are more than [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=81.56s)]
*  one set of principles. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=85.5s)]
*  You reject, and that was the end of your quote. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=87.06s)]
*  So what I want to do is ask you this, you kind of defined this worldview that I presume [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=89.48s)]
*  you were attributing to me and other critics of yours, which is a worldview that you reject, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=96.68s)]
*  and you defined it as post-war civil libertarianism as well as 1960s ACLU ideology. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=101.0s)]
*  I want to ask you, what specific parts of those phrases like 1960s ACLU ideology, post-war [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=111.52s)]
*  civil libertarianism do you object to and not share? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=117.6s)]
*  Well, I think that it's really a mistaken conception of some of America's core freedoms, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=121.96s)]
*  some of America's core conceptions of equality, and then really I think most importantly the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=130.16s)]
*  conception that the founders had of how the republic worked, meaning what kind of institutions [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=135.32s)]
*  comprise the republic, what kind of values are important to be practiced, developed, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=141.92s)]
*  and advanced through the republic, and then what is this actual relationship between the [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=146.98s)]
*  institutions and the state. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=151.78s)]
*  These are complex questions that I think have been boiled down to a series of kind of one-sided, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=154.02s)]
*  one-dimensional ideologies encapsulated in, say, post-war civil libertarianism that has [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=161.34s)]
*  an extreme conception of many of the things that are on the screen here of free speech, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=168.02s)]
*  of so-called academic freedom, institutional autonomy, that these are all in a sense fictions [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=173.6s)]
*  that were invented in recent times that are then back-projected, supposedly representing [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=181.24s)]
*  the Bill of Rights or Enlightenment values, but if you actually scrutinize them, there's [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=186.84s)]
*  really a kind of tenuous connection between the two. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=193.44s)]
*  I think it's highly contestable, and my own principles haven't changed at all, and I'm [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=196.95999999999998s)]
*  sure we'll get into it, but the relationship between principle and power is very key, and [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=202.76s)]
*  the problem with many kind of centrist civil libertarian types is that they want to really [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=207.51999999999998s)]
*  back away from power altogether. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=214.12s)]
*  They think that any exercise of power is inherently corrupted or corruptible, but actually the [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=216.07999999999998s)]
*  founders believed in not arbitrary power, but the judicious use of power towards virtuous [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=222.72s)]
*  ends. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=229.92s)]
*  I think that is a defensible position and actually, in many ways, an inevitable position [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=231.07999999999998s)]
*  because power exists in the world. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=236.6s)]
*  The question is, what do we do with it? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=239.26s)]
*  Absolutely, but just to drill a little bit more deeply and especially to kind of try [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=241.48s)]
*  and extract some specifics of what you disagree with in those worldviews as you've defined [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=248.84s)]
*  them. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=254.6s)]
*  1960s ACLU ideology or post-World War civil libertarianism to me are very similar, and [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=255.6s)]
*  I think if you ask a lot of people who identify with those evolutions, at least, or progress [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=265.52s)]
*  as a lot of people see them, they would cite things like the Brandenburg case of the Supreme [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=272.2s)]
*  Court where a KKK leader had stood up and given a speech basically saying, if the government [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=277.54s)]
*  doesn't stop treating white people unfairly, it will be time for revolution or violence. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=285.16s)]
*  He was convicted under a terrorism statute which said you can't advocate violence against [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=289.7s)]
*  the government. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=294.26s)]
*  The Supreme Court overruled that conviction and said the First Amendment basically is [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=295.26s)]
*  so broad that any kind of expression of political views, even as they said abstract advocacy [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=300.04s)]
*  of violence is protected by the First Amendment. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=305.08s)]
*  The only exception is if you are directing a mob toward imminent violence, like you gather [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=308.47999999999996s)]
*  a mob and you say go burn in that house. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=313.71999999999997s)]
*  And then the other, or one of the other kind of hallmarks or landmarks of ACLU ideology [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=316.08s)]
*  or post-World War civil libertarianism is the Skokie controversy where the American [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=323.03999999999996s)]
*  Nazi party asked for a permit to march through Skokie, Illinois, which was filled with Holocaust [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=326.59999999999997s)]
*  survivors. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=332.28s)]
*  That's the reason they wanted to march there. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=333.35999999999996s)]
*  The city denied the permit saying it's too traumatizing for Holocaust survivors to see [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=335.44s)]
*  people in Nazi uniforms. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=340.84s)]
*  The ACLU notoriously or famously defended them, cost them a lot of support. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=342.0s)]
*  They almost went bankrupt. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=347.64s)]
*  But their argument was that unless you're willing to defend universally applicable rights, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=348.64s)]
*  even to or even on behalf of your most intransigent political enemies, that essentially those [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=354.88s)]
*  rights will cease to have any real meaning. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=362.8s)]
*  Are there things about those specific ideas or values that you find objectionable? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=365.48s)]
*  Well, I mean, look, these are the two kind of canonical and mythological cases for the [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=370.6s)]
*  ACLU. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=377.52000000000004s)]
*  And so the problem is not with the Skokie story, the Skokie case, where I think I'm [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=378.52000000000004s)]
*  broadly sympathetic to your view. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=384.52s)]
*  The question is really about the work that I'm doing, perhaps that the Trump administration [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=388.2s)]
*  is doing, that is really much more complex and really not reducible to, let's say, a [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=392.52s)]
*  First Amendment claim. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=398.68s)]
*  The question is, what do we do with America's institutions? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=400.88s)]
*  What do we do with state universities in Florida or in other places? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=403.71999999999997s)]
*  What is the authority of the president over the administration? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=409.15999999999997s)]
*  How does Article 2 powers work? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=412.76s)]
*  And I think the real hot issue, and perhaps this is where we have some disagreement, and [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=415.84s)]
*  perhaps you can articulate why you have argued that I have abandoned my principles in pursuit [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=421.64s)]
*  of power. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=426.84s)]
*  But if we take what's happening right now with the Ivy League, it's highly contested, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=427.84s)]
*  it's highly controversial, it's a really heated and I think an important fight. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=432.2s)]
*  I think all of these things are consistent and all of the policy work that I did in Florida, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=437.96s)]
*  all of the advocacy, starting back then leading up to the present is part and parcel of one [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=444.68s)]
*  basic principle. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=453.6s)]
*  And the principle that I'd like to advance is in a republic, the people through their [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=455.0s)]
*  elected government get to decide the shape of institutions, they have an absolute authority [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=462.2s)]
*  over the institutions of the state, and they have a reciprocal obligation and to enforce [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=467.16s)]
*  contractual agreements between the state and its contractors or recipients of funds, for [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=474.0s)]
*  example the Ivy League universities. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=478.91999999999996s)]
*  I don't think that that compromises the principle, let's say the liberal principles of the American [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=481.71999999999997s)]
*  founding, but in fact if you look at the founding, what I'm advancing is really consistent with [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=488.44s)]
*  that and I don't think oversteps a bound of any kind. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCqhW1dVHU&t=494.56s)]
