# Trump wants to move on from the Epstein case after promising to give the public answers...
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [July 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQsmgjvogWM)
*  Trump, when asked about it, a matter that his own movement, his own supporters, that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQsmgjvogWM&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump himself was asked about several times during the campaign and said, yeah, that's, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQsmgjvogWM&t=4.48s)]
*  I think that's something that probably should be disclosed. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQsmgjvogWM&t=8.2s)]
*  I'm going to look into this. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQsmgjvogWM&t=9.76s)]
*  That has the audacity to say, how can you ask about something so trivial? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQsmgjvogWM&t=10.92s)]
*  We're dealing with important things like the flood in Texas and this great war victory, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQsmgjvogWM&t=15.8s)]
*  this 12 day war, this glorious war victory, this triumph that we bombed for about 30 minutes [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQsmgjvogWM&t=20.36s)]
*  Iran's nuclear facilities and Netanyahu's here and the two war leaders are expecting [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQsmgjvogWM&t=26.8s)]
*  this parade and gratitude for this historic victory that they ended up waging. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQsmgjvogWM&t=33.2s)]
*  And Trump is saying all these great things we're doing and all these tragedies, you're [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQsmgjvogWM&t=38.72s)]
*  going to talk about something as trivial as the Epstein case, this creep that's dead. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQsmgjvogWM&t=42.72s)]
*  I mean, the people raising the questions most loudly still are Trump's own supporters. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQsmgjvogWM&t=49.0s)]
*  His vice president, his attorney general, his FBI director, his deputy FBI director, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQsmgjvogWM&t=53.62s)]
*  his own attorney, personal attorney who's now the US attorney for New Jersey. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQsmgjvogWM&t=57.839999999999996s)]
*  And he's going to attack a reporter and demean a reporter. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQsmgjvogWM&t=62.04s)]
*  And that's as angry as Trump really gets in terms of like his visceral behavior. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQsmgjvogWM&t=65.58s)]
*  But I said, oh, he exploded in anger at this reporter and a lot of Trump supporters said, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQsmgjvogWM&t=69.06s)]
*  no, he wasn't exploding in anger. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQsmgjvogWM&t=73.14s)]
*  Whatever. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQsmgjvogWM&t=74.66s)]
*  That's a semantic thing. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQsmgjvogWM&t=75.66s)]
*  For me, I haven't seen Trump quite that animated in spewing anger toward a reporter, but whatever. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQsmgjvogWM&t=76.66s)]
*  The substance is what matters and the substance is him suddenly now pronouncing that the Epstein [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQsmgjvogWM&t=81.75999999999999s)]
*  case is not just trivial, but too trivial to even waste his time asking about. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQsmgjvogWM&t=86.41999999999999s)]
*  Now that his administration has said nothing there, nothing to see, move on. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQsmgjvogWM&t=90.69999999999999s)]
*  And that's Trump reinforcing that message. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQsmgjvogWM&t=94.3s)]
