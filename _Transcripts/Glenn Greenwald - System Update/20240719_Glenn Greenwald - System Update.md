# Demanding Low-Wage Workers Be Fired for Online Postings
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [July 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc)
*  Alright, so I just wanted to cover an issue that I've been seeing arise more and more [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=0.0s)]
*  and I haven't really commented on it much except in the context of Israel, but I think [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=11.84s)]
*  it warrants comment now. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=16.2s)]
*  I've certainly commented on this disturbing trend on the part of sectors of fanatical [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=17.32s)]
*  pro-Israel sites and accounts not to target politicians or powerful people with whom they [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=22.2s)]
*  disagree but to target just ordinary citizens and drag them out into the spotlight and demand [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=29.88s)]
*  they be shamed and fired for doing things like putting Palestinian flags on their lapel [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=36.56s)]
*  or on their laptop or expressing criticism of Israel in some other way. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=42.2s)]
*  They dox people, they drag them out into the light, they send hate mobs after them and [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=47.4s)]
*  they often get them fired. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=51.0s)]
*  And we're seeing that more and more on other issues that that sector of the right is doing [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=53.72s)]
*  as well. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=57.04s)]
*  I think I've seen in the last few days, lips of TikTok, an account that I think did some [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=58.12s)]
*  good work and I've actually praised in the past, but I think it often does, as I told [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=62.64s)]
*  the person who runs it, some things that I vehemently disagree with, one of which is [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=67.96s)]
*  this. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=71.4s)]
*  After the Trump administration, the Trump assassination attempt, there were obviously [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=73.4s)]
*  people who said extremely stupid and grotesque things, including like, oh, I wish that bullet [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=77.28s)]
*  had just been aimed a little bit better. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=82.92s)]
*  I wish that bullet had hit Donald Trump. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=85.03999999999999s)]
*  I wish he had died. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=86.28s)]
*  Obviously repulsive and disgusting. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=87.32000000000001s)]
*  And as I said, if somebody with power expresses that view in some public setting, obviously [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=90.12s)]
*  they ought to be held accountable and attacked and punished in some way, even if by loss [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=93.8s)]
*  of reputation or job. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=98.12s)]
*  That's not what's going on here. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=100.16s)]
*  They are targeting, and not just this account, but others as well, the most powerless people [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=101.16s)]
*  in our society, just the most ordinary working class Americans who work at hourly low wage [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=109.76s)]
*  jobs. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=116.16000000000001s)]
*  They stand on their feet all day doing manual labor for very little pay, very few benefits [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=117.16000000000001s)]
*  of any for these giant corporate conglomerates, and they're somehow demanding for some reason [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=123.44s)]
*  that these people be fired, even though they have no influence or power in the world. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=128.64000000000001s)]
*  And I actually think that when a movement starts doing that, aiming itself not at the [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=132.8s)]
*  powerful people that it wants to take down but can't, but instead at the most powerless [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=137.64000000000001s)]
*  people who obviously are easy pickings. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=141.08s)]
*  Anyone can get a Home Depot cashier fired. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=143.08s)]
*  Home Depot will throw away anyone that's a low level worker the minute there's even a [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=146.8s)]
*  slight amount of controversy, let alone something of this magnitude. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=150.08s)]
*  They don't care about their workers. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=152.92s)]
*  And that's exactly what's happening here. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=156.16s)]
*  So here was a tweet from that account on July 14th. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=157.44s)]
*  Hi Home Depot, obviously marked with the Home Depot account. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=159.68s)]
*  Are you aware that you employ people who call for political violence and the quote, and [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=164.8s)]
*  the assassination of presidents? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=169.68s)]
*  Any comments? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=171.72s)]
*  And here's a video of somebody going to they found this woman with a tiny little account [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=173.92000000000002s)]
*  who did say something stupid like, I wish the bullet had hit Donald Trump. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=183.0s)]
*  And they found out where she works. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=188.04000000000002s)]
*  She's a cashier at some department store as some retailer. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=190.04000000000002s)]
*  And they went there and they filmed her and they yelled at her. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=195.70000000000002s)]
*  And then they demanded that Home Depot fire her and when they got her fired, they celebrated [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=198.92s)]
*  as though they had achieved something noble or important or politically significant. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=203.48s)]
*  They're not fighting the CIA. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=209.35999999999999s)]
*  They're not fighting the Pentagon. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=211.07999999999998s)]
*  They're not fighting people who want to take away your rights who are imposing their they're [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=212.44s)]
*  battling against ordinary Americans who say something just ill advised in the heat of [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=217.4s)]
*  the moment to 20 Facebook friends. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=224.16s)]
*  Here's the video of someone being dispatched to after tracking down this woman and finding [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=227.52s)]
*  out where she works and then going there with a video camera. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=232.32000000000002s)]
*  Are you Darcy Waldron? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=234.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=236.56s)]
*  Okay, from Cayuga. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=237.56s)]
*  And you think that the shooter should have been a better shot? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=239.56s)]
*  Is that what you posted on Facebook? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=243.32000000000002s)]
*  You think that the shooter should have been a shooter, huh? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=247.36s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's pretty messed up. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=250.56s)]
*  I'm not the anti-American if you ask me. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=254.52s)]
*  As a veteran, I'm disgusted. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=257.08s)]
*  What have you provided to this country? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=259.46000000000004s)]
*  Huh? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=261.52s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=262.52s)]
*  This is ridiculous. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=267.2s)]
*  You are ridiculous. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=268.66s)]
*  And I'm making you famous. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=270.46000000000004s)]
*  All right, now I have to say I understand the anger. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=271.46000000000004s)]
*  At the last one, they try and get people fired for the things they say are genuine angry [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=277.12s)]
*  about the opinions being expressed. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=281.0s)]
*  They believe that it's repugnant, that it puts people in danger. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=282.92s)]
*  They believe all those things. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=285.08000000000004s)]
*  When they get people censored, when they get people fired. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=286.64000000000004s)]
*  So I understand. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=290.12s)]
*  I mean, obviously it is a reprehensible thing to say, but she's not a news anchor or a senator [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=291.12s)]
*  or a CEO. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=298.14000000000004s)]
*  She's a woman who's just standing there 12 hours a day working at the cashier. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=299.32s)]
*  Like the lowest level person you can find. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=304.12s)]
*  The most powerless, the most vulnerable, the easiest to bully and get fired. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=306.68s)]
*  She's just some woman. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=311.92s)]
*  She has like a tiny little Facebook account. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=312.92s)]
*  And she probably got home from a long miserable day of work of standing on her feet all day [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=315.12s)]
*  at that age at that fitness level. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=319.84000000000003s)]
*  I'm sure that's not easy. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=323.08000000000004s)]
*  It's not a good job. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=324.28000000000003s)]
*  It's not a fun job. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=325.28000000000003s)]
*  It's quite miserable. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=326.28000000000003s)]
*  And when he says, what have you ever given to this country? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=327.28000000000003s)]
*  People who work every day in those kinds of jobs are actually helping this economy run. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=330.0s)]
*  She gets up every day and she works. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=334.68s)]
*  She just sits at home collecting free payments, free money. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=337.0s)]
*  She's actually working that's contributing to society. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=342.04s)]
*  So again, I get the anger of what she said, but to elevate this to a multimillion person [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=344.32s)]
*  mob demanding that she be fired, it's just bullying and purposeless and cruel. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=353.88s)]
*  And I think kind of cowardly. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=360.88s)]
*  Here is a second tweet. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=363.4s)]
*  This is what she posted on Facebook. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=366.06s)]
*  And then again, Mark's Home Depot. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=369.9s)]
*  Dolly Waldron Pickney, make this woman famous. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=371.62s)]
*  Home Depot, Auburn. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=375.18s)]
*  So she works in Auburn at the Home Depot. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=377.3s)]
*  And here's a comment, the comment that she wrote. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=381.34000000000003s)]
*  When I tell you, Butler, Pennsylvania is corrupt and nobody wants to listen after today's events, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=384.42s)]
*  maybe we will start listening. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=388.22s)]
*  And she added too bad they weren't a better shooter. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=390.46s)]
*  Nine people replied to the original post, which is just somebody that she followed on [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=396.22s)]
*  Facebook, some Facebook friend with no reach or platform. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=400.82000000000005s)]
*  And then her comment was up for 10 hours. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=405.3s)]
*  It didn't get a single like or reply. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=408.78000000000003s)]
*  This is like in the smallest, tiniest, most uninfluential corners of the internet that [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=410.46000000000004s)]
*  they're trolling for these kind of comments to bring these people out into light. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=418.42s)]
*  For what? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=422.54s)]
*  And then Home Depot, of course, responded. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=426.02000000000004s)]
*  Because as I said, Home Depot doesn't want any controversy and for a low wage cashier, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=428.78000000000003s)]
*  they'll throw that person away for the slightest controversy, let alone a major one, and says, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=433.90000000000003s)]
*  hi, this individual's comments don't reflect the Home Depot or our values. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=438.38000000000005s)]
*  We can confirm that she no longer works at the Home Depot. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=442.40000000000003s)]
*  And there was a bunch of celebration online as though something had been, some power center [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=447.5s)]
*  had finally been pierced and this gigantic tyrant had been taken down. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=451.3s)]
*  This like 55 year old woman who has to work at that age at a low hourly wage job for a [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=456.66s)]
*  gigantic mega corporation. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=465.3s)]
*  Now I actually appreciate the people who are honest about this and who say, you know what? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=469.42s)]
*  I don't mind censorship. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=476.42s)]
*  I'm in favor of censorship. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=478.86s)]
*  My problem with the left is not that they censor, it's that they censor the wrong views. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=480.14s)]
*  Because obviously that's a lot of people's views on the right. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=485.9s)]
*  They were pretending for 10 years to believe in free speech, but in reality they wanted [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=487.97999999999996s)]
*  views censored. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=490.82s)]
*  They were just angry when the views that they liked got censored, but for people criticizing [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=491.82s)]
*  Israel in a way that they found offensive or excessive or whatever, they were happy [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=496.34s)]
*  to get those people censored and a lot of them got censored or fired. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=499.86s)]
*  Here's Nate Hockman who definitely is on the right and this is what he posted in response [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=504.98s)]
*  to this. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=511.58s)]
*  Quote, every single society in human history has a form of quote cancel culture. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=512.58s)]
*  Stigmas and social consequences for violating them are the basis of civilization itself. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=517.54s)]
*  The debate isn't over whether quote cancel culture should exist. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=524.22s)]
*  It should. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=527.7s)]
*  It's over which things should be canceled and then presumably which things should not. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=529.58s)]
*  And if people on the right had just said that all along instead of pretending that they [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=537.14s)]
*  were against cancel culture, against censorship as a principle and just said look, what we're [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=540.1800000000001s)]
*  angry at the left for is that they're censoring and canceling the wrong people and the wrong [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=544.82s)]
*  ideas, I would oppose that, but at least I wouldn't find the stench of their hypocrisy [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=548.98s)]
*  so nauseating as I do. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=553.7800000000001s)]
*  That's being honest and candid about what they really think and I wish so much more [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=556.1s)]
*  many people on the right would admit that that's what they think since they so obviously [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=559.22s)]
*  do. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=563.34s)]
*  The tweet to which he was responding by the way is from Colin Wright who said quote being [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=566.86s)]
*  against quote cancel cultures matters most when you have the power to cancel. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=570.94s)]
*  As the political right gains more cultural and political power it's important to remain [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=577.14s)]
*  principled. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=581.4200000000001s)]
*  In other words he's saying like canceling is a thing that powerless people do. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=582.4200000000001s)]
*  Oh wow we got this construction worker fired because we think he flashed an okay sign at [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=587.1s)]
*  a stoplight. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=592.74s)]
*  We don't want to know the context, what he really believes, if he's actually a bad person [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=593.74s)]
*  we just want him fired and when we get him fired we're going to cheer because it's the [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=598.86s)]
*  only way a weak moving can get power is by aiming at powerless people and destroying [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=602.4200000000001s)]
*  them. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=607.3000000000001s)]
*  Anyone can do that. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=608.3000000000001s)]
*  That's so easy and it's so purposeless. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=609.3000000000001s)]
*  And so what Colin Wright was saying is like look if you're against cancel culture it matters [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=612.58s)]
*  the most not when you're powerless but when you have not when you're the target of cancellation [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=616.64s)]
*  but when you gain power that's when it matters to say I'm still against censorship and still [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=619.9599999999999s)]
*  against cancellation even though I'm now the one who can do it because I'm the one with [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=623.76s)]
*  power. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=627.36s)]
*  And then you have Nate Hockman saying no I don't believe I don't agree with that. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=628.92s)]
*  I think when we get power we should use it to censor and cancel people because the problem [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=632.8399999999999s)]
*  with cancellation isn't it in and of itself it's just that the wrong people were being [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=637.04s)]
*  canceled. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=641.4399999999999s)]
*  Well here is this account called stop anti-semitism that has grown massively in popularity among [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=643.2s)]
*  the pro-israel rights since October 7th because what they've been doing almost on an everyday [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=653.84s)]
*  basis is identifying just ordinary citizens totally powerless people workers students [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=657.44s)]
*  at just opportunity colleges wherever just people send them pictures of ordinary people [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=665.5600000000001s)]
*  on the street and they post pictures of them for the crime of having a sticker that's pro-Palestinian [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=671.2800000000001s)]
*  or putting something on their social media that's anti-israel and they post their picture [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=677.2800000000001s)]
*  with the specific intention of urging people to tell them the names of those people and [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=682.76s)]
*  find out everything that they can and then they do and they post the person's name and [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=687.36s)]
*  where they work and then they encourage people to go and get them fired and they have gotten [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=690.9200000000001s)]
*  them fired many many times. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=695.12s)]
*  Again we're talking about totally ordinary people whose only crime is just existing in [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=697.68s)]
*  the United States and the cowardice of this account makes me particularly sick since the [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=701.88s)]
*  whole account exists to do nothing but drag ordinary people into the spotlight, dox them, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=708.4399999999999s)]
*  post their name where they work all while the coward who's behind this account remains [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=714.16s)]
*  anonymous hiding under the name stop anti-semitism. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=718.3599999999999s)]
*  So just to give you an example of the kind of thing they've been doing here in January [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=721.12s)]
*  this year, quote, Miami, a woman with a Palestine sticker on her laptop was spotted at MoTek, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=726.08s)]
*  one of the most popular Israeli eateries in South Florida. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=732.6s)]
*  Some patrons were extremely bothered by her and the Palestinian sticker, would you be? [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=737.4000000000001s)]
*  And then they posted a picture, she's just a woman sitting there. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=743.36s)]
*  Now they say oh this is a cafe that a lot of Israelis go to and I'm sorry to say that [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=748.1600000000001s)]
*  because it's in Florida it's not an Israeli cafe, it's an American cafe. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=754.16s)]
*  All the free speech rights apply to cafes inside the United States regardless of whether a lot of [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=760.2s)]
*  people who love Israel go there or not, you're still allowed to express your views and what she [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=765.16s)]
*  was guilty of is she has a bunch of political stickers on her laptop, she has the rainbow flag, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=769.2s)]
*  you can pretty much tell who she is and what she's like. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=775.44s)]
*  Not a person I probably would like or have any political affinity with although except in this [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=778.24s)]
*  one area, but her big crime is she just has a Palestinian flag on her laptop and for that this [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=783.6s)]
*  account, drag her into the spotlight, got her name all over the place and she was just, she wasn't [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=791.12s)]
*  doing anything, just sitting there working on her laptop. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=797.4s)]
*  You're allowed to be an American citizen and put whatever sticker you want on a laptop, whatever [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=800.72s)]
*  flag of any foreign country, you can have an Israeli flag, you can have a Peruvian flag, a South Korean [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=804.32s)]
*  flag, a Palestinian flag, whatever you want, that's your right as an American. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=808.76s)]
*  Another thing they recently did is that they had someone who took a picture of this flight attendant [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=811.8s)]
*  on a Delta flight and his crime was that he had a tiny little Palestinian flag, you can barely see [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=822.8s)]
*  it, it's right there and the policy of Delta was that flight attendants could put on whatever [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=831.12s)]
*  flags they wanted because obviously when you work with an airline part of the idea is you connect [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=838.04s)]
*  the world. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=843.1999999999999s)]
*  A lot of people who work for Delta come from other countries, they have Italian flags or Irish [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=844.1999999999999s)]
*  flags or Indian flags or Israeli flags, no one ever minded until this account, Docs, this flight [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=848.52s)]
*  attendant who committed the crime of wearing a Palestinian flag which might offend people who are [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=857.48s)]
*  pro-Israel, it might scare them. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=864.48s)]
*  And this account said, hey Delta, did you add Palestine as a new summer route? [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=867.72s)]
*  Your customers on a Boston to Washington, Boston to West Palm Beach flight yesterday were [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=871.48s)]
*  perplexed to see your flight attendant adorning a flag of Palestine pin. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=877.52s)]
*  And then they, of course, Docsed him, they found out his name, they said it appears this is the [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=884.24s)]
*  flight attendant, they found his Instagram account, just to say his Instagram account was [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=888.8000000000001s)]
*  instantly, you're talking about a flight attendant who was doing nothing wrong even according to his [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=892.72s)]
*  own company's rules which allowed a flag to be used for any country and they flooded it with all kinds [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=898.0400000000001s)]
*  of hate messages and then Delta changed their entire policy simply because certain people who [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=906.0s)]
*  love Israel inside the United States didn't like their policy, quote, update effective July 15th, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=913.08s)]
*  2024, Delta flight attendants will only be permitted to wear US flagpins on their uniforms, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=917.48s)]
*  stop anti-Semitism, welcomes the policy change and encourages other US-based airlines to follow suit. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=922.96s)]
*  Just constricting more and more the ability of workers to express themselves in accordance with [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=930.64s)]
*  their company's rules. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=935.48s)]
*  Here's another example that then this account, this perspective Vanderbilt U students and parents [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=938.96s)]
*  were shocked to see undergraduate admissions counselor Brianna Grimes supported Kaifa during an [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=944.96s)]
*  information session yesterday. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=951.52s)]
*  Grimes oversees admission for numerous states, including New York for Vanderbilt. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=953.08s)]
*  How can someone like Grimes be trusted to make fair and equitable decisions when reviewing the [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=957.2800000000001s)]
*  applications of Jewish students? [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=962.12s)]
*  There you see her. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=967.0s)]
*  So obviously they would not, even though it's exactly the same thing, take a picture of an [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=969.48s)]
*  undergraduate admissions person wearing a gigantic Star of David or there's really American flags on their label [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=973.48s)]
*  and say, how could this admissions counselor possibly be fair to Muslim or Arab students applying? [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=980.08s)]
*  This is an account existing solely to prevent American citizens, ordinary ones with no power, from [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=987.72s)]
*  expressing pro-Palestinian or anti-Israeli views, to destroy the free speech and rights of free [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=992.9200000000001s)]
*  expression of ordinary citizens to protect this foreign country. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=998.9599999999999s)]
*  And they've been cheered by it by so many people on the right who have been screaming for years about [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=1002.04s)]
*  cancel culture, about people being fired for their views. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=1006.04s)]
*  And we could spend all night showing you these kind of examples. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=1010.04s)]
*  So and there's been so many others with people who said those sorts of things about President Trump, who people are on a [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=1012.16s)]
*  witch hunt after. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=1018.12s)]
*  Now, again, I just I'm not obviously defending anyone who said those sorts of things about Donald Trump. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=1021.0799999999999s)]
*  In fact, I'm saying specifically that there those things are a pugnant. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=1028.6s)]
*  But the idea that any kind of political movement would devote itself to destroying the life of some random worker, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=1033.36s)]
*  but you have no idea why they said it. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=1041.08s)]
*  Maybe they were angry. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=1042.4399999999998s)]
*  They've used the Internet to blow off steam like a lot of people do. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=1043.24s)]
*  They're speaking to 15, 20 people. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=1045.6s)]
*  And I think that is a very dark turn for a movement to take to start trying to destroy ordinary citizens for [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=1050.0s)]
*  even expressing offensive views. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=1058.56s)]
*  Confine yourself to people with power. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=1060.8799999999999s)]
*  Go confront courageously actual institutions of authority that influence other people, standard lives of hourly wage workers [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=1062.48s)]
*  and stop sending gigantic hate mobs to them, to their house, to their workplace, to their email, to their inbox and trying to get them fired. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=1071.56s)]
*  It's pathetic. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=1079.44s)]
*  It's pathetic bullying designed to make weak people feel strong and it accomplishes absolutely nothing. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_nL9h7Tkc&t=1081.28s)]
