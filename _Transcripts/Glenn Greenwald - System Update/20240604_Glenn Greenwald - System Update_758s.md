# Ukraine's Draft Dodger Problem Grows as Russia Gains Ground in War
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [June 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU)
*  So one of the ways that we can actually see some dissent, I guess you could call it, from [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=0.0s)]
*  the war policies in Ukraine is something you've been reporting on and discussing a lot of [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=14.68s)]
*  and showing videos a lot of, which is the growing number of Ukrainian men who are physically [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=19.82s)]
*  resisting, not just hiding, but when they're found physically resisting the Ukrainian military [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=24.88s)]
*  recruiters who are trying to take them and force them to enlist in the military and then [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=31.52s)]
*  fight in the front line. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=37.28s)]
*  There was a BBC report from a month ago or so that said since the start of the war, something [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=39.4s)]
*  like 650,000 Ukrainian men have left the country, have fled the country, have found a way out [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=45.68s)]
*  of the country, presumably to avoid the war. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=52.6s)]
*  Do you think that this trend that you're showing is a growing trend among Ukrainian men resisting, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=55.800000000000004s)]
*  being drafted, and if so, why is that growing? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=66.64s)]
*  Yes, this is exactly it. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=70.2s)]
*  The videos which you just showed from different regions of Ukraine, one of them was filmed [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=72.64s)]
*  in the native region of Dnipro, Dnipro-Vetrovsk region of Southern Ukraine or Eastern Ukraine, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=76.72s)]
*  which is native region of Zelensky. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=83.24s)]
*  Another video was from Kiev city and another video was actually from Lviv region in the [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=85.56s)]
*  Western Ukraine, which is a very anti-Russian region and in all these regions, basically [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=91.08s)]
*  in all these different locations of Ukraine, people try to escape evasion, they try to [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=95.84s)]
*  specifically because they are caught by police or by military recruiters on the street and [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=101.48s)]
*  then they sent to the front line without very significant amount of training, without any [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=108.88000000000001s)]
*  skills and many people get killed. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=114.60000000000001s)]
*  So I look into such evidence, I analyze these videos on social media, I watch hundreds of [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=117.44s)]
*  videos each day and I only post very limited amount of the videos because this is just [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=122.2s)]
*  what I find as part of my research, just representative videos which I posted recently and which [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=129.16s)]
*  received also a lot of attention, but I can say that a number of such videos increased [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=135.64s)]
*  very significantly since new mobilization law was announced by Zelensky two weeks ago [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=139.8s)]
*  and they show that there is very significant resistance to mobilization, to force mobilization [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=146.44s)]
*  to continue this war by people not only in Eastern and Southern Ukraine but also people [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=152.0s)]
*  in Western Ukraine and people in Central Ukraine and this is not only based on the videos [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=159.0s)]
*  because if you look into statistics in addition to the number of people which are mentioned [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=164.72s)]
*  in this BBC report which you cited, 650,000 who actually left Ukraine, actually according [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=169.88s)]
*  to a statement by a former advisor to President Zelensky who actually said in one of his media [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=179.16s)]
*  interviews that four and a half million of Ukrainian men would resist updating their [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=186.64s)]
*  information in military recruitment offices because they do not want to be called for [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=194.64s)]
*  the military, to be basically conscripted to the military service. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=200.64s)]
*  So four and a half million Ukrainians resisted doing this voluntarily and now they face very [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=204.92s)]
*  significant punishment in terms of very significant fines and even the possibility of confiscation [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=211.12s)]
*  of property and even imprisonment if they would continue not to register their information [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=216.8s)]
*  to military recruitment offices. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=223.92000000000002s)]
*  Just looking to other sources of information, there was an interview by one of the officials [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=226.68s)]
*  from Lviv region, again in Western Ukraine which is a very anti-Russian region, who said [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=233.32s)]
*  that recently just 2% of people who actually called to summons to military recruitment [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=238.88000000000002s)]
*  offices come voluntarily. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=245.64000000000001s)]
*  So this means 90, 80% of people in the most anti-Russian region of Ukraine do not want [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=247.96s)]
*  to do this. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=252.92000000000002s)]
*  And according to other information, according to Ukrainian media reports, there were millions [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=254.4s)]
*  of people who actually, more than one million people, men of military age who actually now [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=261.72s)]
*  were called to be wanted by the police because they also awaited military registrations, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=267.08000000000004s)]
*  they awaited to be called for the military service. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=273.76000000000005s)]
*  In addition to this, just to check my native region of Western Ukraine, the Volhynia region, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=276.76000000000005s)]
*  which is very close to Poland, and there is a telegram group of people who actually just [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=283.92s)]
*  watch announcements about, daily announcements about military conscription offices, their [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=290.71999999999997s)]
*  location and what they do, in which places they wait and try to capture men for the military [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=296.59999999999997s)]
*  service. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=304.12s)]
*  And this group now has almost 40,000 members, subscribers. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=305.12s)]
*  So this is just information. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=310.03999999999996s)]
*  So basically this means if you look into possible number of people who are eligible for military [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=311.68s)]
*  service now in this region, so this would mean that at least 25% of people, men actually [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=317.28s)]
*  who are eligible for military service actually try to escape and avoid a call for such a [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=324.36s)]
*  service in Western Ukraine in this region. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=331.36s)]
*  But if you're looking to other people who are not subscribers to this telegram channel, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=333.71999999999997s)]
*  but watch this, just read this without subscribing, and people who might be doing this as part [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=339.15999999999997s)]
*  of their families. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=345.4s)]
*  So now it's very likely that the absolute majority of people, men in Western Ukraine [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=346.56s)]
*  actually do not want to be basically captured and brought to the front line. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=351.48s)]
*  And I think this is much more significant evidence of actual opinion of Ukrainians compared [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=357.16s)]
*  to what we see in the media and public opinion polls, which are not representative, because [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=362.12s)]
*  they are, I think, very biased and just not reliable. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=367.2s)]
*  I have a new book which will be published also soon, which is an open access book in [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=371.6s)]
*  which I also examine these issues, I cite these issues, specifically as evidence of [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=376.92s)]
*  real public opinion and not what is actually presented in the media as basically Ukrainian [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=382.32s)]
*  men and Ukrainians wanting to justify Russia to the last Ukrainian. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=387.04s)]
*  I think this is actually a view which is expressed by Western politicians. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=391.32s)]
*  They often kind of use Ukraine just to fight Russia to the last Ukrainian. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=395.64s)]
*  And I think this is a very unfortunate situation because this leads to very significant casualties [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=400.6s)]
*  in Ukraine and would be devastating effect on Ukraine and Ukrainians. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=406.04s)]
*  One of the things that amazed me is there's been a lot of reports, even in the Western [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=411.12s)]
*  media, about the political difficulties Zelensky had in expanding the draft mobilization law. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=414.64000000000004s)]
*  And the age of the draft had been 27 and he lowered it to 25, and even that was very difficult [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=421.68s)]
*  to pass. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=428.72s)]
*  You had a lot of political resistance. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=429.84000000000003s)]
*  And then you had an American senator, Lindsey Graham, who's been a very vehement supporter [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=431.8s)]
*  of the war in Ukraine and pretty much a vehement supporter of every war that has ever existed, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=437.48s)]
*  who went to Ukraine and then came back and he said he was shocked to learn that the draft [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=443.48s)]
*  age was only 27 and then moved to 25. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=448.92s)]
*  Now it kind of scares me that someone who's been so involved in talking about the war [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=451.68s)]
*  and governing the war in the United States didn't know what you would know even just [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=457.88s)]
*  from reading basic reports. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=461.64s)]
*  But I think one of the things he was reacting to is that during Vietnam and other American [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=463.92s)]
*  wars the draft age in the United States was 18. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=468.48s)]
*  So we were sending 18 and 19 and 20 year old kids over to fight in Vietnam and other wars [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=471.92s)]
*  before that where the draft was used. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=477.08000000000004s)]
*  Why is the draft age in Ukraine not been lowered to say 18? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=479.48s)]
*  Why is it at 27 and now 25 given how difficult it is for Zelensky to get enough people on [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=485.4s)]
*  the front line? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=491.47999999999996s)]
*  I think one issue is political difficulty because Zelensky did not want to kind of damage [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=494.0s)]
*  or endanger his reputation, his approval in Ukraine because for him basically public relations [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=500.03999999999996s)]
*  is the most important issue. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=507.96s)]
*  So he very carefully pays attention to his image and a lot of his actions dictated by [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=509.64s)]
*  his own view what would be beneficial to him in terms of public opinion in Ukraine and [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=515.8s)]
*  in the West. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=521.1999999999999s)]
*  So in this case such change of recruitment age to lower age would be not very popular [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=522.54s)]
*  in Ukraine and for this reason Zelensky resisted this for a very long time. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=529.3199999999999s)]
*  But this change after visits by the United States politicians and also the US senator [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=533.56s)]
*  whom you mentioned and they basically told Zelensky to lower the draft age and he did [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=539.56s)]
*  this because Ukraine is what I say is a client state of the United States and the United [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=545.4799999999999s)]
*  States has a lot of say and influence in terms of policy of the Ukrainian government. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=550.7199999999999s)]
*  Zelensky just follows often US policy in this case and instructions given by US politicians. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=557.8s)]
*  So here kind of just follows this in the case of lowering the draft age. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=565.24s)]
*  But I think another issue is that there is a very small number of actually people or [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=570.72s)]
*  men of this age group eligible for military service in Ukraine because one of the issues [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=576.4s)]
*  there was after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 there was a very significant [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=582.72s)]
*  drop of a number of children that people have. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=587.76s)]
*  And so in this case the number of people who could be eligible in this age group is much [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=595.3199999999999s)]
*  smaller compared to older generations before the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=599.36s)]
*  Another issue is that a lot of younger people of this age group younger than 25 years old [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=606.5600000000001s)]
*  also have exemptions for military service because such exemptions are given to students [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=614.48s)]
*  for instance. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=619.52s)]
*  So a lot of people who just went to universities or studied in universities they are exempt [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=620.52s)]
*  from military service. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=624.96s)]
*  And I think one of the policies dictated by Zelensky since the start of the war was to [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=627.76s)]
*  ban all Ukrainians from the age of 18 years old to 60 years old from leaving Ukraine. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=635.0s)]
*  So now people are actually eligible for military service by their age and not only this goes [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=641.7199999999999s)]
*  to people who are 18 years old and until 25 years old not able to leave Ukraine. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=648.68s)]
*  And this is just a result of the policy of Zelensky and I think there is still a possibility [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=657.12s)]
*  that because of the current situation on the front line which has a very negative dynamic [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=662.04s)]
*  for the UK because of the Russian military advantage so Zelensky might be forced to even [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=666.64s)]
*  lower the military age, the age of much younger age groups including 18 years old. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=672.52s)]
*  And there are a lot of people, especially people who are now given interviews in the [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=679.68s)]
*  television and they call to do this. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=685.48s)]
*  They call openly for Zelensky to lower the draft age to 18 years old and this is specifically [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=687.76s)]
*  given by people from the Azov regiment or from the Far-right sector group and so on. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=694.96s)]
*  So now they lobby basically or they press Zelensky to lower the draft age and I think [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=702.72s)]
*  this is a possibility that he would be forced to do this because now this very difficult [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=708.2s)]

*  defeat. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=717.96s)]
*  But basically using again Ukrainians to try to stop Russian advance which will be very [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=719.52s)]
*  difficult to do this because Russia has advantage in manpower but also military advantage in [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWjEWBE1fU&t=725.04s)]
