# Did Trump Greenlight Israel's Attack on Iran?
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [June 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg)
*  Now, the news of the Israeli strike last night brought a lot of speculation about the role [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=0.0s)]
*  that Donald Trump had played in this, if any, and a lot of people, including his most ardent [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=14.0s)]
*  defenders, were eager to exonerate him from the responsibility that he now clearly has [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=20.12s)]
*  for having encouraged or permitted or even helped initiate a new war in the Middle East, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=27.12s)]
*  something that Trump repeatedly said he was so proud of in his first term that he was [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=32.120000000000005s)]
*  the first president in decades not to involve the U.S. in a new war. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=35.760000000000005s)]
*  And a lot of people were trying to suggest that this was some sort of embarrassment because [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=40.8s)]
*  Trump did say yesterday publicly, I don't want the Israelis attacking Iran now because [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=45.24s)]
*  I want these diplomatic talks to continue, including one that had been scheduled and [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=51.72s)]
*  confirmed on Sunday in Oman, which is the sixth round of talks. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=57.28s)]
*  So Trump publicly postured as if he would oppose any sort of Israeli strike, but it [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=60.68s)]
*  is utterly inconceivable that Israel would have struck Iran without getting the green [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=68.52s)]
*  light from the Trump administration for so many reasons, including the fact that had [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=76.96s)]
*  they done so, Trump would have a million different ways to punish them using all the leverage [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=82.19999999999999s)]
*  that the United States has in terms of what it provides to Israel monetarily and militarily [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=86.75999999999999s)]
*  and politically and diplomatically. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=91.52s)]
*  But also the Israelis need and are already relying upon the U.S. military to protect [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=94.83999999999999s)]
*  itself from any possible Iranian retaliation. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=102.0s)]
*  And the idea that they would have done this without Trump's green light seemed immediately [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=105.16s)]
*  and intuitively absurd that they might do so. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=110.52s)]
*  And since then, Trump has issued a series of statements that strongly suggest that he [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=114.36s)]
*  not only knew about it, but approved the strikes and wants to even take credit for what's being [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=118.92s)]
*  depicted as the success of the first wave of strikes. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=124.28s)]
*  Here he is early this morning on True Social, quote, I gave Iran a chance after chance to [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=127.03999999999999s)]
*  make a deal. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=133.32s)]
*  I told them in the strongest of words to quote, just do it. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=134.84s)]
*  But no matter how many, no matter how hard they tried, no matter how close they got, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=137.95999999999998s)]
*  they just couldn't get it done. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=141.56s)]
*  I told them it would be much worse than anything they know anticipated or were told that the [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=143.48s)]
*  United States makes the best and most lethal military equipment anywhere in the world by [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=147.95999999999998s)]
*  far and that Israel has a lot of it and much more to come. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=153.0s)]
*  And they know how to use it. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=156.68s)]
*  Certain Iranian hardliners spoke bravely, but they didn't know what was about to happen. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=158.88s)]
*  They are all dead now and it will only get worse. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=163.12s)]
*  There has already been great death and destruction, but there is still time to make the slaughter [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=167.20000000000002s)]
*  with the next already planned attacks being even more brutal come to an end. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=171.92000000000002s)]
*  Iran must make a deal before there is nothing left and save what was once known as the Iranian [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=175.56s)]
*  Empire. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=180.6s)]
*  No more death, no more destruction. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=181.6s)]
*  Just do it because it is too late. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=183.68s)]
*  God bless you all. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=185.08s)]
*  Not really sure what that even means at this point. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=187.04000000000002s)]
*  I mean, the Israelis certainly haven't taken out the Iranian nuclear facilities and decapitating [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=192.12s)]
*  several of the commanders in the chain of command or even killing some of their nuclear [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=201.28s)]
*  physicists as they did apparently while in their apartment buildings in Tehran killing [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=204.0s)]
*  other people as well. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=209.12s)]
*  Kin, I suppose, set back the Iranian program a little bit. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=210.72s)]
*  The Israelis have killed many nuclear physicists in Iran over the years. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=215.68s)]
*  They have damaged various facilities, but ultimately the know-how of how to make nuclear [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=221.95999999999998s)]
*  weapons is something you can't extinguish or eradicate and it would take infinitely [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=226.6s)]
*  greater military force of the kind the Israelis really don't possess like B-2 bombers dropping [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=232.0s)]
*  massive bombs to destroy underground facilities to really eliminate, physically eliminate [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=238.07999999999998s)]
*  the Iranian nuclear program. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=243.0s)]
*  President Trump seems to be saying that that's exactly what the US in conjunction with Israel [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=244.79999999999998s)]
*  will do unless the Iranians immediately submit to some sort of deal that really wouldn't [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=248.35999999999999s)]
*  be a deal, but I guess it would be seen as a sort of term of surrender. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=252.44s)]
*  Here was Trump on Twitter. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=258.59999999999997s)]
*  Actually this was Trump on Twitter back in 2012 when there was rising tension between [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=263.71999999999997s)]
*  the US under President Obama and Iran and here's what President Trump had to say in [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=270.28s)]
*  being highly critical of Obama and the likelihood of what would happen as a result of his deficiencies. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=275.08s)]
*  Our president will start a war with Iran because he has absolutely no ability to negotiate. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=279.91999999999996s)]
*  He's weak and he's ineffective. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=287.64s)]
*  Alright, so if, what actually happened there was that Obama did reach a deal with Iran [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=290.2s)]
*  that averted the need for a military conflict by all accounts including the US intelligence [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=298.59999999999997s)]
*  community's own assessments. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=302.88s)]
*  Iran was complying with the deal. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=305.6s)]
*  It was very difficult for them not to comply with that deal. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=306.6s)]
*  There was surveillance everywhere. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=308.96s)]
*  There were inspectors all over the place and they were not enriching uranium past the point [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=310.32s)]
*  where the Iran deal permitted them to enrich. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=316.12s)]
*  That deal was in place, had averted a conflict by all accounts, had averted any ability or [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=319.64s)]
*  pursuit of nuclear weapons on the part of Iran and that was something President Trump [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=326.0s)]
*  in 2016 ran on the campaign of nullifying that agreement in 2018 or 2017. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=330.24s)]
*  He withdrew the United States from that deal and that's why there's been no deal ever since. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=334.96000000000004s)]
*  Here was CNN's Dana Bash speaking this morning about a conversation she had with Trump about [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=340.68s)]
*  all of this. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=346.88000000000005s)]
*  She said quote, I just spoke with President Donald Trump on the phone. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=347.88000000000005s)]
*  The president told me that the US supports Israel, of course, as always, the US supports [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=351.28000000000003s)]
*  Israel and called the strikes on Iran last night quote, a very successful attack. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=357.04s)]
*  Quote, we of course support Israel, obviously, and supported it like nobody has ever supported [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=361.72s)]
*  it, Trump said during our brief phone call. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=367.04s)]
*  Quote, Iran should have listened to me when I said, you know, I gave them, I don't know [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=369.48s)]
*  if you know, but I gave them a 60 day warning and today is day 61, he added. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=373.32000000000005s)]
*  They should now come to the table to make a deal before it's too late. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=379.32000000000005s)]
*  It will be too late for them. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=382.32000000000005s)]
*  You know, the people I was dealing with are dead. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=383.64000000000004s)]
*  The hardliners, the president said, he would not specify which people he was referring [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=386.04s)]
*  to, asked if last night was, if this was a result of Israel's attack last night, Trump [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=389.8s)]
*  responded sarcastically, quote, they didn't die of the flu, they didn't die of COVID, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=395.92s)]
*  meaning of course they died because the Israelis killed them and Trump is not just approving [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=399.84000000000003s)]
*  it after the fact, he's making it very clear that he played a key role in approving the [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=404.92s)]
*  deal beforehand, that he supports the deal, he's even taking credit by saying I gave them [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=410.8s)]
*  a 60 day window to get a deal done, they didn't get a deal done, so on the 61st day, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=414.8s)]
*  look what we did to them. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=419.32s)]
*  And it's another war where the United States is working in conjunction with Israel, another [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=420.88s)]
*  war that the United States started against a major enemy of Israel. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=425.8s)]
*  Now, there's a lot of celebration taking place, a lot of kind of triumphant rhetoric suggesting [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=433.88s)]
*  that, oh, Iran has already lost, the Israelis in the United States have already won, it [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=440.2s)]
*  reminds me a lot of the kind of rhetoric we heard in the first 10 days of the invasion [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=444.2s)]
*  of Iraq when the regime fell very quickly. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=448.92s)]
*  Saddam Hussein and his top aides and family went into hiding, the regime kind of just [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=452.56s)]
*  disintegrated and we were told we won the war. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=459.76s)]
*  In 10 days, all the people who supported the war mocked those who were concerned about [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=462.84s)]
*  a protracted conflict that they were proven wrong, that the war had already been won. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=467.4s)]
*  That's the kind of thing that this rhetoric is reminding me of a great deal. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=472.84s)]
*  We'll see what the Iranian response is, what kind of response they're able to amount to, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=476.56s)]
*  it's possible maybe they won't be able to amount to a response, but it's certainly possible [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=481.2s)]
*  that they will, that this is not just a three or four day bombing exercise, but something [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=487.47999999999996s)]
*  that instead will turn into an escalatory conflict that will subsume the Israelis and [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=493.12s)]
*  the United States military into a protracted conflict. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=498.03999999999996s)]
*  And the results of which are practically impossible to predict, that has always made this war [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=503.44s)]
*  so dangerous. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=507.88s)]
*  The Trump administration is already deploying US military assets in the Middle East in response [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=510.88s)]
*  to the Israeli strikes and the possible Iranian retaliations. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=516.84s)]
*  A lot of people are saying, look, I don't care about this war. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=521.24s)]
*  I see a lot of Trump followers, Trump supporters saying, I don't care about this war as long [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=523.84s)]
*  as we're not involved. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=528.44s)]
*  The United States is involved, as always, with Israel. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=529.44s)]
*  And I want to make that very clear. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=533.4000000000001s)]
*  Aside from the fact that we pay for their wars, that we furnish the weapons for their [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=535.4000000000001s)]
*  wars, Trump is saying, we make the best weapons in the world and those are the ones the Israelis [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=538.4000000000001s)]

*  That's what the Israelis are all saying as well from the Jerusalem Post earlier today. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=629.2800000000001s)]

*  with evidence of Iran's breakthrough toward a nuclear bomb. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=647.24s)]
*  There was full and complete coordination with the Americans. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=650.24s)]
*  Israeli officials were initially concerned that US President Donald Trump on Thursday [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=654.24s)]
*  evening, suggesting Israel, quote, might attack, alerted the Iranians. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=659.24s)]
*  The statement, which was made at around 7 p.m. Israel time, mere hours before the attack [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=664.24s)]
*  was perceived as a kind of green light for Israel. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=669.24s)]
*  The fear that this remark could expose the attack operation ultimately led to Trump's [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=673.2s)]
*  late night tweet at midnight stating that, quote, the US seeks a diplomatic solution. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=676.2s)]
*  Now, you probably remember, and we went over this quite a bit at the time over the last [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=683.2s)]
*  two to three months, there was all this talk deliberately cultivated by the White House [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=688.2s)]
*  about how there was a rift between Israel and Trump on the one hand and Netanyahu, or [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=693.2s)]
*  rather the US and Trump on the one hand and Israel and Netanyahu on the other. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=700.1600000000001s)]
*  In anticipation of Trump's trip to the Persian Gulf dictatorships, there was all these claims [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=704.1600000000001s)]
*  that the US was doing this over Israel's objections, warning, including the Israelis, that Trump [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=711.1600000000001s)]
*  had stopped the bombing attack on Yemen over the Israelis' objections, constantly creating [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=716.6s)]
*  the idea that there was this sort of rift, that Trump was no longer willing to be impeded [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=724.76s)]
*  in making deals that he wanted to make simply because Netanyahu and the Israelis objected. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=730.04s)]
*  There were also suggestions that Netanyahu had wanted to attack Israel previously, but [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=737.04s)]
*  that Trump put a stop to it and Netanyahu was enraged. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=741.04s)]
*  And at the time, there were some people, not many, but some people who I was citing but [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=745.04s)]
*  wasn't necessarily convinced by, I will admit, who were claiming that, no, of course, there's [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=750.04s)]
*  no actual rift between Netanyahu and Trump. There's no real split at all between the US [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=755.9599999999999s)]
*  and Israel that this is essentially theater to convince the Iranians that they don't have [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=762.9599999999999s)]
*  to worry about an attack for now because the US is constraining Israel. And every time [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=769.9599999999999s)]
*  Trump spoke optimistically about progress toward a diplomatic solution, so went this [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=772.9599999999999s)]
*  theory. That was designed to lure the Iranians into a false sense of security, to believe [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=778.9599999999999s)]
*  that there was no attack imminent because the United States wouldn't permit the Israelis [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=784.88s)]
*  to attack while the US was still negotiating. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=787.88s)]
*  And it does seem as though the people who were arguing that turned out to be vindicated [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=791.88s)]
*  because both the US and the Israelis are now boasting of the fact that that was all theater, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=797.88s)]
*  including this late night tweet from Trump where he had earlier in the day suggested [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=804.88s)]
*  maybe the Israelis are going to attack. I hope they don't. And the Israelis were concerned [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=812.8s)]
*  that was signaling to Iran they were going to attack and that would eliminate the surprise [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=817.4s)]
*  and that's why Trump went back last night and said, we're still on the diplomatic path [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=821.12s)]
*  to make the Iranians think that we were still trying to negotiate. In other words, it was [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=825.72s)]
*  all a ruse jointly orchestrated between the two countries. This is what Axios reported, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=831.32s)]
*  and again Axios has that former IDF soldier, Barak Ravid, and when I say former IDF soldier [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=838.8000000000001s)]
*  I mean until 2023 he was in the reserves, he's an Israeli citizen, has basically served [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=844.8000000000001s)]
*  as the Israeli messenger ever since October 7th for Axios. And Axios reported this today. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=851.8000000000001s)]
*  The article says Israel's strike on Iran was eight months in the making, but then here's [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=860.8000000000001s)]
*  what it reports, quote, two Israeli officials claimed to Axios that Trump and his aides [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=864.8s)]
*  were only pretending to impose an Israeli strike in public and didn't express opposition [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=869.7199999999999s)]
*  in private, quote, we had a clear US green light, one claimed. The goal they say was [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=875.7199999999999s)]
*  to convince Iran that no attack was imminent and make sure Iranians on Israel's target [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=881.0s)]
*  list wouldn't be moved to new locations. Netanyahu's aides even briefed Israel reporters that Trump [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=885.4799999999999s)]
*  had tried to pull the brakes on an Israeli strike in a call on Monday when in reality [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=891.76s)]
*  the call dealt with coordination ahead of the attack, Israeli officials now say. The [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=897.3199999999999s)]
*  US side has not confirmed any of that in the hours before and after the strike. The Trump [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=903.04s)]
*  administration distanced itself from the Israeli operation in public statements and private [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=907.4399999999999s)]
*  messages to allies. Secretary of State Marco Rubio swiftly stated that Israel's attack [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=912.3199999999999s)]
*  was, quote, unilateral with no US involvement. Hours later, though, Trump confirmed that [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=916.96s)]
*  he knew the attack was coming, but stressed the US had no military involvement. Now, as [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=922.8000000000001s)]
*  I said, since then, there have been a lot of statements from Trump, as we just showed [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=927.32s)]
*  you, boastfully and proudly taking credit for the key role the US played, warning that [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=930.08s)]
*  more is to come either from the Israelis and or the Americans, unless the Iranians quickly [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=934.96s)]
*  agree to a deal, which as we went over last night has dramatically shifted from the American [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=940.0600000000001s)]
*  perspective. It began with a recognition. And Steve Witkoff said this, others said this, [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=945.2s)]
*  that of course the Iranians need to be able to enrich at low enough levels to be able [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=951.5600000000001s)]
*  to have a nuclear energy program, but not so high that it can be used for a nuclear weapon. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=955.0s)]
*  And over the last week or two, you heard Trump's rhetoric start changing where he said Iran [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=960.32s)]
*  can't enrich at all, which was the way that people like Netanyahu and Tom Cotton and Lindsey [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=966.96s)]
*  Graham, who wanted a war in the first place, had to pretend they wanted to deal the way [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=972.24s)]
*  Trump did, tried to set this up was, oh yeah, we want to deal with Iran as long as it means [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=976.6800000000001s)]
*  you dismantle their entire nuclear energy program and don't allow any enrichment. That [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=981.0400000000001s)]
*  was obviously an attempt to pretend to want an agreement while ensuring no agreement could [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=985.36s)]
*  ever be reached where war was the only alternative. And it seemed as though Trump began absorbing [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=989.2800000000001s)]
*  that language and that view over the last 10 days and even tried to pretend that somehow [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=993.8000000000001s)]
*  it was the Iranians who had changed. Trump said something happened to Iran. They were [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=998.72s)]
*  on the road to a deal and now suddenly they're insisting on things we can't allow them, meaning [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=1003.36s)]
*  enrichment. Even though low levels of enrichment was always the prerequisite to getting a deal [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=1008.24s)]
*  because Iran will not give up its nuclear energy program. Here is an Israeli journalist, Amit [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=1013.48s)]
*  Segal, who's reporting pretty much the same thing, that all of this was a ruse between [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=1020.24s)]
*  the US and Israel. Citing an Israeli source, quote, the attack on Iran was preceded by [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=1024.12s)]
*  a deception operation that included media and diplomatic components, both internal and [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=1029.36s)]
*  external involving various actors. Israel succeeded in surprising Iran with psychological [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=1035.2399999999998s)]
*  maneuvers. And his basic argument is that by Trump pretending that he was still on the [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=1041.08s)]
*  diplomatic track that was designed to signal to Iran, don't worry, we're still engaged [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=1049.52s)]
*  in diplomacy, so we're not going to let Israel attack you. When in reality that was all an [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=1054.0800000000002s)]
*  orchestrated plan to lure the Iranians into a false sense of security. Just to give you [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=1058.0s)]
*  a sense for how obviously bipartisan support for Donald Trump will be, the Democrats only [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=1064.64s)]
*  support Trump when he bombs people in the Middle East. Here's Debbie Wasserman Schultz, [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=1069.3600000000001s)]
*  the long time congresswoman from South Florida, represents a very heavily Jewish district. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=1073.64s)]

*  vehement supporter of Israel. I'm sure this is something similar to what Chuck Schumer [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=1085.32s)]
*  will say, other Democratic Party leaders. Quote, I stand firmly behind Israel's right [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=1089.68s)]
*  to defend itself. Iran has long funded terror groups who killed Americans and has moved [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=1094.44s)]
*  to develop nuclear weapons to aim at Israel. If Israel strikes, set back Iran's nuclear [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=1099.44s)]
*  program will all be safer. The White House must ensure the safety of U.S. civilians, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=1105.16s)]
*  diplomats and military in the region, and the U.S. must support Israel's defense. We [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=1108.96s)]
*  must always work closely with our allies to protect American interests. So there you see [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=1114.1200000000001s)]
*  Debbie Wasserman Schultz, long the head of the Democratic National Committee, echoing [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=1118.0s)]
*  what I'm certain will be a large view with the Democratic Party, if not the majority, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=1122.88s)]
*  refusing to criticize Trump for anything, in fact urging him to make sure that he does [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=1128.68s)]
*  everything possible to militarily use the U.S. military to protect this foreign country [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=1132.28s)]

*  America stands unequivocally with Israel, period the end. That is critically important. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=1172.04s)]
*  Israel is acting to defend herself, to defend herself against the existential threat of [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=1178.4s)]
*  an Iranian nuclear weapon. But number two, and this is equally important, look we have [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=1183.08s)]
*  a very large number of American servicemen and women in bases in the Middle East that [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=1188.8s)]
*  are in harm's way. And I want to ask every one of your listeners, every one of your viewers, [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=1193.16s)]
*  if you're a person of faith, pray for Israel tonight. Pray for Israel, pray for Jerusalem, [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=1199.02s)]
*  and pray for our servicemen and women, the Americans in harm's way, and a message that [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=1205.0s)]
*  I think is critically important, I want the Ayatollah to hear. If you attack American [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=1209.72s)]
*  military bases, if you kill even a single American serviceman or woman, I'm absolutely [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=1214.88s)]
*  confident that President Trump will respond with overwhelming force. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=1222.1200000000001s)]
*  So this is the mindset of a lot of people, certainly in the Republican Party and the [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=1228.92s)]
*  Democratic Party, which is we're going to put our soldiers in that region, we're going [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=1232.88s)]
*  to insinuate themselves right into the middle of the conflict. We worked with the Israelis [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=1237.0s)]
*  to initiate this attack, weapons they used came from the United States for that purpose, [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=1242.24s)]
*  and if Iran kills so much as a single American soldier in retaliating against this attack [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=1246.24s)]
*  on its country, then who knows what this means, but obviously it's designed to insinuate that [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=1251.92s)]
*  we could use nuclear weapons against Iran or we could just destroy all of it. This is [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=1258.44s)]
*  consistent with President Trump's very extreme warmongering rhetoric that Iran had better [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=1262.64s)]
*  agree to a deal on American terms before there's nothing left in Iran, meaning all of Iran [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=1268.56s)]
*  is destroyed. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=1275.0s)]
*  If your dog is constantly itching, scratching, or dealing with hot spots, you've got to check [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=1276.48s)]
*  out coat defense. It's an all natural solution that's been helping so many dogs, and here's [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=1284.44s)]
*  why this caught my attention. As many of you know, we have more than two dozen rescue [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=1289.58s)]
*  dogs at our house. We also have a shelter for abandoned animals that has another 150 [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=1294.78s)]
*  or between 150 and 200 dogs at any given point. So I'm working with dogs all the time. I [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=1299.9399999999998s)]
*  see how often they develop yeast infections, especially in their paws and their ears and [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=1304.78s)]
*  their skin fold. It's way more common than people realize. The problem is that the usual [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=1310.1799999999998s)]
*  treatments like steroids and antibiotics and Abiquel or Cetopoint, they might cover [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=1314.58s)]
*  up the symptoms for a while, but they don't really fix the root cause. And in some cases, [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=1319.82s)]
*  they actually make things worse over time, but coat defense is different. Their daily [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=1324.4199999999998s)]
*  preventative powder works as a dry shampoo, odor eliminator, and anti-itch powder. But [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=1328.76s)]
*  what makes it special is that it eliminates yeast naturally by changing the terrain on [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=1333.82s)]
*  your dog's skin so that yeast and bacteria can't survive. No toxic chemicals, no synthetic [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=1338.1s)]
*  junk, just safe natural ingredients. They also make an aloe based sensitive skin shampoo [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=1343.34s)]
*  that calms irritated skin, preserves the natural oils and microbiome, and is totally free of [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=1348.6599999999999s)]
*  parabens, sulfates, and anything artificial. And honestly, I have been really overwhelmed. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=1354.78s)]
*  They've been a sponsor for our show for a while, reading the testimonials, seeing firsthand [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=1360.54s)]
*  the efficacy of their products. I've heard from so many people that this is the only [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=1365.1399999999999s)]
*  thing that after so many years have frustration actually works with dogs finally itch free [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=1368.74s)]
*  and healthy again. And that's why I've been happy to partner with Coat Defense. So if [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxp0CTsHpGg&t=1373.06s)]
