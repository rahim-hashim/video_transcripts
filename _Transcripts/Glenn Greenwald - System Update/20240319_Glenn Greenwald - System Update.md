# SCOTUS Hears Landmark Online Censorship Case: Complete Breakdown
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [March 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c)
*  It's not often that the Supreme Court hears landmark cases that define the free speech [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=0.0s)]
*  rights of Americans. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=11.72s)]
*  In fact, you can argue that such an event happens maybe once every decade. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=12.72s)]
*  Oftentimes you have to go back many decades to understand the scope of free speech rights [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=19.0s)]
*  by going back, for example, to the Brandenburg case that the United States decided in the [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=24.04s)]
*  United States Supreme Court decided in the late 1960s that still defines the outer contours [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=28.799999999999997s)]
*  of political speech and what it protects in the United States. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=33.6s)]
*  Or the Claiborne ruling, which occurred in the early 1980s by a unanimous Supreme Court [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=36.92s)]
*  that sets limits on how people can be held responsible for the consequences of their [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=41.64s)]
*  speech. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=45.84s)]
*  It's not often that the US Supreme Court issues a landmark ruling that defines free [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=46.84s)]
*  speech. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=52.239999999999995s)]
*  The oral argument that the Supreme Court held today is the single most important free speech [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=53.72s)]
*  case not only in decades, but the single most important free speech case in the digital [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=60.800000000000004s)]
*  era where it's not newspapers that are our primary means of hearing news as happened, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=66.64s)]
*  for example, in the New York Times ruled that the Nixon administration could not issue an [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=72.92s)]
*  order of pie restraint against the New York Times to prevent publication of the Pentagon [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=77.88s)]
*  papers, another landmark ruling that happened in the early 1970s. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=81.39999999999999s)]
*  It has nothing to do with television. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=86.63999999999999s)]
*  This is about the role that the United States government will be permitted to play in attempting [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=88.47999999999999s)]
*  to suppress online political expression, political speech of American citizens on the primary [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=94.24s)]
*  means by which we now trade ideas and hear one another's opinions and news from various [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=102.24s)]
*  outlets, which is the internet. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=110.2s)]
*  And we have reported extensively on all the different ways that the US government, and [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=112.28s)]
*  not just the US government, but the EU government and the UK government and the Canadian government [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=117.12s)]
*  and the Brazilian government and governments around the world now understand that the power [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=121.56s)]
*  of the internet is so great, is such a threat to power centers and to establishment orthodoxies [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=126.28s)]
*  precisely because when it's free, it is impossible to centralize ideas and power and [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=132.12s)]
*  therefore it is impossible to control the flow of information. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=139.64s)]
*  And that is why Western governments, including the United States, have made it a priority [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=142.92s)]
*  to create theories that allow it to justify why they have to control the internet, why [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=147.61999999999998s)]
*  they have to suppress free speech, why they have to censor. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=153.39999999999998s)]
*  And one of the things they do is they have to create theories that justify and convince [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=157.6s)]
*  Americans that they ought to not just tolerate this censorship, but crave it. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=162.04s)]
*  And one of the arguments the United States government has long made is that we have to [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=166.88s)]
*  keep you safe from the hate speech. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=169.56s)]
*  But a lot of Americans now understand that hate speech is such a malleable concept that [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=173.26s)]
*  it's dangerous to simply endorse the idea that the government can censor hate speech [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=177.92s)]
*  because that's often by eye of the beholder. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=182.32s)]
*  But after 2016, when free speech on the internet led to things like the British people opting [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=186.46s)]
*  to leave the EU through Brexit, and most importantly, the American people defying what they were [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=193.6s)]
*  told to do and voting for Donald Trump instead of Hillary Clinton, it became the number one [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=198.84s)]
*  priority of American financial, political, and media elites to create theories, new theories [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=204.56s)]
*  to persuade Americans to support censorship. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=210.23999999999998s)]
*  And the primary argument they created was that there was this new kind of danger in [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=213.07999999999998s)]
*  the internet era called disinformation. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=219.4s)]
*  Disinformation we were told comes often from foreign powers. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=224.6s)]
*  It helped interfere in the 2016 election and foster the result that American liberals [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=228.04000000000002s)]
*  to this day regard as an apocalypse. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=232.78s)]
*  Disinformation they say is what convinced Americans not to take the vaccines they were [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=236.68s)]
*  told to take and therefore died in large numbers. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=240.52s)]
*  That disinformation is this grave threat and therefore we need the government to protect [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=244.02s)]
*  us from it. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=248.9s)]
*  And this has become the leading orthodoxy in liberal thought, including in most parts [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=250.54000000000002s)]
*  of the corporate media, which of course have a liberal ideology. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=257.3s)]
*  These are people who live in liberal cities, who circulate in liberal cultural precincts. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=260.26s)]
*  And so the idea that the US government has to be able to control the flow of information [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=264.98s)]
*  to protect us from disinformation and the dangers that it creates, including by even [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=270.74s)]
*  especially by dictating and influencing and coercing what is and is not permitted to [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=277.22s)]
*  be said online, has become one of the central ideological beliefs of American liberalism, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=283.3s)]
*  broadly speaking. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=292.1s)]
*  Meaning everything from the left wing of the Democratic Party to the establishment liberals [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=293.70000000000005s)]
*  like Hillary Clinton and Chuck Schumer and Joe Biden and the people who surround him, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=298.62s)]
*  to the centrist and even parts of the establishment of the Republican Party who have all united [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=303.54s)]
*  in the belief that disinformation is something that can be defined. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=308.3s)]
*  Typically it means dissent from establishment orthodoxies. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=312.94s)]
*  It is dangerous to be permitted and therefore we have to censor in order to stop it. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=315.42s)]
*  And that is what is at the heart of what the Supreme Court had to decide today. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=321.34000000000003s)]
*  And it was obvious that many of the justices on the Supreme Court, not only the liberal [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=326.18s)]
*  justices, but several other conservative justices as well, believe that it is most [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=330.02s)]
*  definitely an appropriate role for the United States government to play to at the very least [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=336.7s)]
*  pick up the phone and call big tech companies in private and convey to them which views [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=342.46s)]
*  they think should be suppressed and which people they think should be silenced. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=349.26s)]
*  And while most everybody is willing to agree, except for Justice Brown Jackson, that what [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=354.34s)]
*  the U.S. government cannot do is accompany those requests with explicit threats, meaning [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=361.38s)]
*  unless you censor the way we tell you to, we will destroy your company, pretty much [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=369.73999999999995s)]
*  everyone except for Justice Brown Jackson seems to agree that that is not permissive. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=373.62s)]
*  What they seem to be believing is that even when the U.S. government is throwing its weight [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=381.1s)]
*  around, when they're having the FBI call the big tech platforms at the same time that they're [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=386.74s)]
*  threatening to punish them in all sorts of ways by removing protections under the law [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=392.26000000000005s)]
*  that they need or by attacking them in regulatory and legal ways, that there's somehow nothing [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=396.3s)]
*  sufficiently coercive about that behavior that makes it unconstitutional, even though [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=402.98s)]
*  the four federal judges underneath the Supreme Court who have all looked at this question, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=409.54s)]
*  all agreed not only that the Biden administration was violating the Constitution, but was doing [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=415.62s)]
*  so in a flagrant and glaring way. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=420.21999999999997s)]
*  Now there's other questions that the Supreme Court has to decide that are more technical [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=423.82s)]
*  in nature, which we'll get to, including whether or not these plaintiffs who brought this lawsuit [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=428.14s)]
*  even have the right to sue the U.S. government at all, and whether they could actually prove [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=433.52s)]
*  that the reasons they were censored was because of the U.S. government. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=439.14s)]
*  But on the merits itself, there were a lot of very disturbing comments that were made, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=443.46s)]
*  not only by the liberal justice, but by several of the conservative justices as well, including [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=448.26s)]
*  Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett and even John Roberts that makes me, if I had [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=451.58s)]
*  to bet, believe that it is more likely than not that the U.S. Supreme Court in this case [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=458.09999999999997s)]
*  will find a way to reverse the appellate court in the district court and throw this case [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=462.7s)]
*  out and not give the American people what we need more than anything, which is protection [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=467.34000000000003s)]
*  from official state censorship through the power of big tech in the digital era. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=472.86s)]
*  Now I want to begin by playing for you one of the more encouraging exchanges, which was [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=479.1s)]
*  an exchange that took place between Justice Alito and the lead lawyer for the government, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=487.98s)]
*  who's the deputy solicitor general. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=496.46s)]
*  And this was Justice Alito explaining to the government what his reaction was when he looked [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=500.41999999999996s)]
*  at this broad record of how often and continuously and aggressively the government was telling [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=506.65999999999997s)]
*  big tech what they wanted censored. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=512.98s)]
*  Exchange between the White House and other federal officials and Facebook in particular, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=515.98s)]
*  but also some of the other platforms. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=520.46s)]
*  And I see that the White House and federal officials are repeatedly saying that Facebook [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=523.3s)]
*  and the federal government should be partners. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=531.18s)]
*  We are on the same team. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=533.6999999999999s)]
*  Officials are demanding answers. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=535.6999999999999s)]
*  I want an answer. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=537.74s)]
*  I want it right away. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=538.74s)]
*  When they're unhappy, they curse them out. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=540.0999999999999s)]
*  There are regular meetings. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=543.74s)]
*  There is constant pestering of Facebook and some of the other platforms, and they want [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=545.18s)]
*  meetings and they suggest rules that should be applied and why don't you tell us everything [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=551.5s)]
*  that you're going to do so we can help you and we can look it over. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=557.86s)]
*  And I thought, wow, I cannot imagine federal officials taking that approach to the print [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=561.62s)]
*  media. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=570.62s)]
*  Our representatives over there, if you did that to them, what do you think the reaction [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=571.62s)]
*  would be? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=577.3s)]
*  And so I thought, you know, the only reason why this is taking place is because the federal [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=578.3s)]
*  government has got section 230 and antitrust in its pocket and it's to mix my metaphors [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=583.2199999999999s)]
*  and it's got these big clubs available, available to it. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=590.66s)]
*  And so it's treating Facebook and these other platforms like their subordinates. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=594.8199999999999s)]
*  All right. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=599.8599999999999s)]
*  Now, this to me goes to the heart of everything. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=600.8599999999999s)]
*  The argument that the government was making to defend the Biden administration and that [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=605.98s)]
*  several of the justices seemed convinced by was, look, when the FBI comes knocking on [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=610.0600000000001s)]
*  Facebook's door or on Google's door or the CIA does, the CDC does, or the Biden White [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=616.38s)]
*  House at the highest level does, and they say, we want this information that you're [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=621.26s)]
*  allowing to be censored. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=627.4s)]
*  You should not be allowing this information. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=629.1800000000001s)]
*  I know what Just Alito was saying is they're not polite about it. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=632.3000000000001s)]
*  They're demanding. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=635.82s)]
*  If they don't get answers right away, they say, how dare you not answer us? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=637.7s)]
*  We want to hear your answer. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=640.88s)]
*  They demand meetings. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=642.66s)]
*  They want regular channels of communication that allow them to constantly submit censorship, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=643.66s)]
*  requests or orders to these big tech companies. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=649.58s)]
*  Because as Just as Alito said, the government sees these big tech platforms as their subordinates. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=653.86s)]
*  And the reason they see them as their subordinates is because unlike with media outlets, which [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=660.18s)]
*  are protected by the First Amendment, which can publish things, even if the government [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=666.78s)]
*  dislikes it, at least this is the old form of journalism. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=672.3s)]
*  It always used to be that way. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=675.5s)]
*  The New York Times would publish classified information and there was nothing the government [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=676.5s)]
*  could do about it. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=680.9799999999999s)]
*  Obviously, during the Snowden report that I did in 2013 for The Guardian and in 2014 [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=681.9799999999999s)]
*  and 2015 for the Intercept and media outlets around the world, I was always in conversation [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=685.74s)]
*  with the government and the government was saying, we don't want you to publish these [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=691.3s)]
*  documents. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=693.9s)]
*  And if they provided a good reason why we shouldn't, namely if they can convince us [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=694.9s)]
*  that publishing a certain document would cause a lot of harm to innocent people without much [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=699.16s)]
*  value, we would decide, okay, we wouldn't publish that. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=703.22s)]
*  But that happened very rarely. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=706.66s)]
*  It did happen one or two times, but very rarely. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=707.9s)]
*  In the vast majority of the cases, the government understood that the power about deciding whether [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=711.1800000000001s)]
*  or not to publish resided with us and they were trying to convince us politely and through [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=715.58s)]
*  persuasion about what we could or couldn't publish, but we knew that they had no power [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=722.5s)]
*  to stop us or to punish us if we did. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=728.46s)]
*  And so the relationship was obviously one of them coming to us hat in hand trying to [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=731.74s)]
*  convince us. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=736.62s)]
*  And what Justice Alito was saying here correctly is that if you look at the way the US government [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=737.6600000000001s)]
*  speaks to Facebook and Google and other big tech platforms, it's not that kind of a relationship [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=742.82s)]
*  because there are all sorts of things that the US government can do to punish big tech [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=750.1400000000001s)]
*  if they do not comply. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=755.4200000000001s)]
*  We saw this happen with Parler. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=759.08s)]
*  Parler was the free speech alternative to Twitter at the time and to Facebook. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=763.9s)]
*  And right when President Trump was banished, even though he was the sitting president of [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=773.1s)]
*  the United States by Twitter and Facebook, something that world leaders, including in [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=777.78s)]
*  France and Germany and throughout Europe that hated Donald Trump said was extremely alarming [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=783.1s)]
*  to watch big tech silence the sitting president of the United States, Parler said, we're going [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=787.5799999999999s)]
*  to create a platform where there's no censorship, where people can speak freely, just like Rumble [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=792.66s)]
*  is now doing as the free speech alternative to YouTube. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=798.3s)]
*  And you add government officials, including powerful ones in the Congress, come and tell [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=802.74s)]
*  Google and Facebook and rather Google and Apple, you better remove Parler from your [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=808.8199999999999s)]
*  stores. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=814.9399999999999s)]
*  How can you allow a platform that allows hate speech and disinformation to continue to be [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=815.9399999999999s)]
*  downloaded through your stores? [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=820.18s)]
*  And Google and Apple obeyed those requests and took out Parler from their stores and [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=821.9s)]
*  then Amazon removed it from their web services precisely because they knew that Congress [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=830.0999999999999s)]
*  had the power to punish those companies in all sorts of ways. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=834.0799999999999s)]
*  And there have been so many times when Democrats were in control of the House and now that [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=838.7199999999999s)]
*  they're in control of the Senate where they've summoned big tech CEOs before them and they've [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=843.38s)]
*  said to them explicitly, we've shown you this so many times, either you start censoring [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=848.64s)]
*  more in the way that we want, you start taking down more disinformation and more hate speech [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=853.88s)]
*  or we will act against you. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=859.4s)]
*  So the relationship is inherently coercive. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=862.8000000000001s)]
*  If the FBI calls Facebook or the White House at the highest level calls Google or Twitter [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=865.12s)]
*  and says, why are you allowing these posts here? [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=871.78s)]
*  Why are you allowing these people here? [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=874.82s)]
*  We want them silenced. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=876.32s)]
*  The idea that this is just persuasive, that they're just trying to convince these platforms [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=877.68s)]
*  benevolently to remove it, but the power rests with these platforms is a fifth grade understanding [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=883.1999999999999s)]
*  of how the United States government works, especially when it comes to big tech. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=889.06s)]
*  There are all sorts of protections big tech needs, particularly section 230, which immunizes [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=894.08s)]
*  them from liability. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=898.28s)]
*  If a user of Facebook posts something that's defamatory or if somebody on Twitter posts [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=901.16s)]
*  something that is somehow illegal, section 230 says these platforms can't be held responsible [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=906.64s)]
*  for what their users publish. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=911.44s)]
*  If you were to remove section 230, you would destroy the business model of these companies [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=914.2s)]
*  and the Biden administration has often held that club that swirred above their head here [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=921.44s)]
*  from Politico in September of 2022, White House renews calls to remove section 230 liability [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=928.28s)]
*  shield. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=935.2s)]
*  So they know they have all these weapons in their hands to threaten big tech with. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=937.6800000000001s)]
*  They use it explicitly. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=941.44s)]
*  Now the main case that has governed this situation and it's one that we've covered before was [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=944.9200000000001s)]
*  a 1964 case called Bantam Books and what happened in Bantam Books is perfectly applicable to [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=952.84s)]
*  what the Biden administration is doing here. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=960.94s)]
*  I actually was writing about this before this case even existed back in 2019 and 2020 I [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=963.96s)]
*  started saying the US government's efforts to influence what big tech can and cannot [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=969.6800000000001s)]
*  allow is crossing over into censorship of the kind that the US Supreme Court in Bantam [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=976.4000000000001s)]
*  Books said was unconstitutional because what happened in Bantam Books was that a bookstore [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=982.2s)]
*  in Rhode Island was selling a book that had sexual themes and a local zoning board in [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=988.44s)]
*  Rhode Island thought that that book was inappropriate, that it was obscene, that it should not be [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=994.44s)]
*  sold. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=1001.0s)]
*  Now they knew they couldn't directly pass a law banning the selling of this book because [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=1003.08s)]
*  that would be censorship, that would violate the First Amendment and so what they did instead [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=1008.2800000000001s)]
*  was they started threatening the bookstore and the publishing company with all kinds [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=1013.08s)]
*  of fines and all kinds of investigations and all kinds of violations, in other words, [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=1017.22s)]
*  intimidating them to take down the book voluntarily and ultimately the bookstore took down the [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=1020.9s)]
*  book and the publishing company sued and said yes the US government didn't directly censor [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=1028.8600000000001s)]
*  but what they did was they intimidated the bookstore into doing for the government what [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=1034.66s)]
*  the government was barred from doing directly, namely removing the book. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=1039.54s)]
*  That is exactly what the US government has repeatedly done when it comes to Facebook [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=1044.54s)]
*  and Google and every other platform is they're constantly using their threats both in Congress [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=1051.3799999999999s)]
*  and in the White House. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=1056.1399999999999s)]
*  So when you get a call from the highest level of the White House and they're not just calling [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=1058.22s)]
*  and saying hey we would appreciate it if you removed down this post, they call and say [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=1063.62s)]
*  we told you two days ago to remove this post, you better effing remove it and they've used [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=1067.82s)]
*  profanity and they use aggression and they're speaking to them as Justice Alito said like [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=1073.46s)]
*  subordinates that is a case where the government has instituted a regime of censorship precisely [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=1077.94s)]
*  where the big tech companies know that they don't actually have the option to do it because [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=1085.14s)]
*  if they don't obey they will be punished. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=1089.7s)]
*  Here is Mark Zuckerberg the founder and CEO of Facebook in June of 2023 making an extraordinary [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=1093.58s)]
*  confession about exactly what was happening precisely at the time that all of this pressure [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=1101.3s)]
*  was being applied. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=1107.14s)]
*  This was during COVID when the government did not want anybody questioning the efficacy [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=1108.14s)]
*  of masks, the efficacy of lockdowns, the efficacy of school closings and ultimately the safety [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=1114.46s)]
*  and the efficacy of vaccines. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=1123.5s)]
*  They were calling Facebook all the time and saying we demand that you remove this content. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=1125.58s)]
*  This was also a time when the Biden administration did not want anybody questioning the integrity [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=1129.74s)]
*  of the 2020 election and so they would call people up and they would call Facebook and [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=1134.7s)]
*  Google all the time and they would say there are these people spreading doubts about the [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=1139.3s)]
*  integrity of the 2020 election, why are you allowing these political viewpoints to remain [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=1143.68s)]
*  up and here is Mark Zuckerberg explaining how Facebook perceived all of that pressure. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=1148.78s)]
*  So misinformation I think has been a really tricky one because there are things that [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=1156.46s)]
*  are kind of obviously false, that are maybe factual but may not be harmful. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=1164.22s)]
*  Since it's like all right are you going to censor someone for just being wrong if there [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=1173.7s)]
*  is no kind of harm implication of what they are doing I think that there is a bunch of [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=1179.94s)]
*  real kind of issues and challenges there. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=1183.3400000000001s)]
*  But then there are other places where it is, you just take some of the stuff around COVID [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=1186.08s)]
*  earlier on in the pandemic where there were real health implications but there hadn't [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=1192.0s)]
*  been time to fully vet a bunch of the scientific assumptions and unfortunately I think a lot [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=1199.1999999999998s)]
*  of the establishment on that kind of waffled on a bunch of facts and asked for a bunch [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=1203.76s)]
*  that in retrospect ended up being more debatable or true and that stuff is really tough and [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=1211.36s)]
*  really undermines trust in that. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=1218.4399999999998s)]
*  So what he is saying there is that you might have people saying factually false things [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=1222.9199999999998s)]

*  Now as I said there were several Supreme Court justices that seemed not just comfortable [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=1420.3s)]
*  with the idea that the Biden administration needs to be telling Big Tech what to take [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=1434.5s)]

*  Brown Jackson who made some pro censorship arguments that were so extreme that it actually [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=1449.3s)]
*  kind of shocked me to hear a Supreme Court justice advocating a view of censorship that [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=1457.02s)]
*  the Supreme Court has repeatedly rejected but the reality is as I said earlier that [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=1462.18s)]
*  it's almost a religious conviction now on the part of American liberals that things [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=1468.02s)]
*  like disinformation are so dangerous and social media is so dangerous that of course we have [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=1472.78s)]
*  to have the government exercising the power to dictate what can and cannot be said. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=1478.26s)]
*  When Matt Taibbi went to testify before the Congress I remember very well that the House [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=1484.3799999999999s)]

*  of every first amendment analysis you'll have the strict scrutiny framework in which you know in some [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=1802.1s)]

*  and question I would ask is has the government set out to abridge the freedom of speech and in [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=1831.22s)]
*  this case you see that time and time again because if you control that's not the test for first [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=1836.1s)]
*  amendment violations your honor this flows from the plain text of the first amendment right no I [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=1840.42s)]
*  understand but we have we have a test for a determination of whether or not the first amendment [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=1844.8200000000002s)]

*  what I would say is that the courts below never got to strict scrutiny because the government [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=1864.5800000000002s)]

*  question in this case and I would urge the court to address the state action issue just like you [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=1876.34s)]
*  addressed it in bantam books use that term four times in bantam books and could you understand [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=1880.26s)]

*  that's going to be the basis on which the supreme court rules in favor of the Biden administration if [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=1890.98s)]
*  it does namely that well she's sure the Biden administration's censored and they have every right [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=1896.02s)]

*  be that the government can prosecute the new york times after the fact for publishing this information [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=1952.4199999999998s)]
*  if the government can meet all these extremely high standards for being able to prosecute a [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=1959.3799999999999s)]
*  newspaper but they can't do it in advance under any circumstances that would be prior restraint [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=1964.6599999999999s)]
*  and what katanji brown jackson was saying was that of course sometimes the government does have the [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=1970.98s)]
*  power in advance to say this information on social media is so bad and so wrong and so dangerous [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=1975.62s)]
*  that yes we have to allow the government to be able to order big tack to remove it she's defending [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=1982.82s)]
*  that position here is another exchange where a similar issue emerges though even in a more [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=1988.4199999999998s)]
*  extremist and a clearer way [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=1996.42s)]
*  sir and is that your view has the first amendment hamstringing the government in significant ways [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=2002.18s)]
*  in the most important time periods um i mean i want to play that again because this is at the [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=2009.0600000000002s)]
*  heart of it and this is what the new york times article from this weekend that i want to review [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=2016.8200000000002s)]
*  in just a second also tries to implant she believes and i think other colleagues on [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=2019.94s)]
*  of hers on the supreme court also are ready to to say that the supreme court is like a an [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=2030.74s)]
*  impediment or i'm sorry the free speech guarantee is like a an impediment to the government being [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=2038.66s)]
*  able to do things it needs to do that we need it to do she's saying the first amendment hamstrings [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=2045.22s)]
*  the government from doing things at the most important moments that we needed to do for example [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=2051.62s)]
*  if there's a covid pandemic we cannot allow dissent to the decrees of the scientific establishment [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=2058.18s)]
*  about what people should and shouldn't do it's too dangerous and we can't allow the free speech [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=2067.94s)]
*  right of the constitution to hamstring the u.s government from doing the important things it [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=2073.7s)]
*  needs to do to protect us this is exactly what the new york times did it depicted free speech concerns [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=2079.9399999999996s)]
*  as an unreasonable and far right obstacle to having the government do what it needs to do [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=2087.14s)]
*  in this dangerous time which is protect us from disinformation this has become the religion of [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=2094.58s)]
*  the liberal establishment about why censorship is so necessary and it became so manifest [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=2099.54s)]
*  i mean to hear it being advocated by journalists is one thing to hear it being advocated by a [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=2106.42s)]
*  supreme court justice is something else entirely my biggest concern is that your view has the first [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=2111.54s)]
*  amendment hamstringing the government in significant ways in the most important time periods [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=2120.82s)]
*  um i mean what would what would you have the government do i've heard you say a couple times [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=2128.5s)]
*  that the government can post its own speech but in my hypothetical um you know kids this is not [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=2132.82s)]
*  safe don't do it um is not going to get it done and so i guess some might say that the government [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=2138.9s)]
*  actually has a duty to take steps to protect the citizens of this country and you seem to be [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=2147.06s)]
*  suggesting that that duty cannot manifest itself in the government encouraging or even pressuring [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=2153.7s)]
*  platforms to take down harmful information i mean i just i i can't let this go in terms of how [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=2161.22s)]
*  extremist this is she created a hypothetical and several of them did as well let's imagine that [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=2168.98s)]
*  something really bad is going on online there's some claim being made that's dangerous or false [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=2177.22s)]
*  and the justices are saying doesn't the government have to be able to call big tack and say take this [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=2184.66s)]
*  down and the response of the louisiana solicitor general which in this case was quite good was no [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=2190.1s)]
*  the government has a lot of options joe biden can be go on national television at any moment that [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=2198.98s)]
*  he wants the u.s government has all kinds of powerful megaphones to counter speech that it [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=2205.9399999999996s)]
*  claims is false that's the constitutional framework the way the government is supposed [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=2211.22s)]
*  to respond to speech it regards as false and dangerous is not by calling people up and ordering [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=2217.54s)]
*  it to be taken down that's what the first amendment is there to prohibit the solution [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=2222.4199999999996s)]
*  if there's dangerous things being said that might be harmful to children or adults in a pandemic is [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=2229.54s)]
*  for the government to go and try and convince americans that that information is false [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=2235.3799999999997s)]
*  and that's what he was saying that the government has solutions they're not they're not required to [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=2241.2999999999997s)]
*  sit by silently members of the executive branch members of congress are permitted and they do all [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=2247.06s)]
*  the time say there's things going on online being said that we don't agree with and then the citizens [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=2253.7s)]
*  get to hear from their government their citizens get to hear from their opponents and from dissidents [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=2261.14s)]
*  of the government and one of the things social media has liberated us from is the fact that we [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=2266.26s)]
*  no longer are imprisoned in the power of a small handful of gigantic corporations all of whom have [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=2272.26s)]
*  the same identical interest in serving the government's messaging this is what they're [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=2279.38s)]
*  afraid of this is what they're saying i appreciate justice brown jackson for being as explicit as she [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=2284.26s)]
*  is she's speaking for american liberals here and she's saying we can't allow free speech anymore [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=2291.2200000000003s)]
*  it's too dangerous that's what's at the heart of this case that's what is at the heart of the bad [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=2295.94s)]
*  administration's behavior it's what the heart of all these laws that countries throughout the [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=2301.94s)]
*  democratic world are enacting to control the internet that they believe free speech no longer [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=2307.2200000000003s)]
*  is a luxury that we can afford because not really just hate speech most importantly [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=2312.18s)]
*  disinformation is something that is too dangerous to permit and i guess at the end of the day [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=2320.66s)]
*  there probably are two groups of people one group is a group that believes that [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=2328.1s)]
*  the government can be trusted to dictate what is and is not disinformation and remember if you [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=2336.66s)]
*  think i'm exaggerating that homeland security tried to create an office led by that crazy woman [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=2342.8199999999997s)]
*  nina yankovic that was designed to do exactly that and that became a bridge too far thankfully [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=2349.06s)]
*  even for our political culture but the new york climes article this weekend which i'm about to [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=2354.9s)]
*  show you actually held that up as an example the failure of the homeland security office [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=2358.2599999999998s)]
*  as a way in which right-wing fanatics are using free speech to prevent the government from helping [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=2365.2999999999997s)]
*  us and protecting us the failure of that homeland security office so that's one group of people [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=2371.54s)]
*  people who trust the u.s government to dictate what is and is not disinformation and to censor [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=2376.58s)]
*  the internet based on their judgments and the other group is people who do not trust the [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=2380.58s)]
*  government to do that and i would suggest that the only way to believe in the constitution [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=2386.34s)]
*  is by being in this second group [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTpuf9us4c&t=2392.74s)]
