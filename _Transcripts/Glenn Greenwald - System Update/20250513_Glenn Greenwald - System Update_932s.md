# Trump/Netanyahu RIFT Getting More Real?
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [May 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo)
*  Time will tell, but what is happening for certain is the public discourse has changed [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=0.0s)]
*  in a way we haven't ever seen before. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=11.92s)]
*  With US officials openly telling the Israelis, like, sorry, but you don't control our government [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=15.08s)]
*  and we don't have to get your permission to do things. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=22.64s)]
*  Then you have Steve Wittkopf, Trump's very aggressive envoy, who's trying to get a diplomatic [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=26.08s)]
*  solution in Ukraine with Russia, as well as in Gaza, as well as with the Gulf states, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=31.36s)]
*  as well as rescuing hostages. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=36.239999999999995s)]
*  Basically blaming Israel for the fact that there are still hostages there. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=39.64s)]
*  Something that, by the way, the hostages' families have done as well, saying that, you [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=42.44s)]
*  know, who doesn't care about the hostages, doesn't really want them there, that's the [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=45.32s)]
*  pretext. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  And so we're seeing lots of different examples of things that would have been unthinkable [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=50.92s)]
*  even three months ago when it comes to Israel and the United States. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=56.72s)]
*  Here is the latest example. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=61.84s)]
*  Earlier today it was announced that Hamas had released an American citizen who's also [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=65.4s)]
*  an Israeli citizen named Eden Alexander. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=73.6s)]
*  Though the media and the government, various politicians keep calling him, oh, an American [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=78.83999999999999s)]
*  from New Jersey, he's actually an Israeli citizen who went to Israel, not to sightsee, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=83.28s)]
*  and then got kidnapped by Hamas, but he was in the IDF, he was in a foreign army fighting [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=90.75999999999999s)]
*  for a foreign country. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=95.19999999999999s)]
*  He was in uniform, he was in a military base when he was detained by Hamas. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=97.08s)]
*  This isn't just some innocent civilian, this is somebody who was fighting in a war. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=101.96s)]
*  Obviously, anybody who's in captivity who shouldn't be in his release, that's something [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=107.08000000000001s)]
*  that is positive, but the amazing thing was that Trump and Wittkopf negotiated the release [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=112.56s)]
*  of Alexander without the involvement of the Israelis. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=118.2s)]
*  They went around the Israelis, directly negotiated with Hamas, using Qatar and Egypt as their [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=121.72000000000001s)]
*  mediators, as their go-betweens. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=127.84s)]
*  As a result, Hamas, as a good gesture of faith to Trump, released the last American hostage [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=131.4s)]
*  that's alive in Gaza. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=140.79999999999998s)]
*  Here you see from Axios, Hamas to release Israeli-American hostage as a gesture to Trump. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=143.32s)]
*  Hamas said Sunday it will release Israeli-American hostage Eden Alexander, who has been held [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=148.28s)]
*  for over 550 days, as part of an effort to reach a ceasefire deal and resume humanitarian [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=153.23999999999998s)]
*  aid deliveries to Gaza. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=158.23999999999998s)]
*  Alexander's release is also thought to be a gesture by Hamas to President Trump as he [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=160.92s)]
*  visits the Middle East later this week, sources said. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=163.95999999999998s)]
*  The Israeli's Prime Minister's Office said American officials had informed Israel of [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=167.16s)]
*  Hamas' intention to release Alexander as a gesture to the U.S. without any conditions [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=171.48s)]
*  or anything in return. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=175.85999999999999s)]
*  Israel was preparing for the possibility that this move would materialize. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=178.2s)]
*  Per Israeli policy, there will be no ceasefire while negotiations take place and Israel remains [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=181.39999999999998s)]
*  committed to defeating Hamas. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=186.12s)]
*  This is yet again, like Trump's decision to stop bombing the Houthis in exchange for a [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=189.76s)]
*  mere promise that the Houthis would stop bombing or attacking U.S. ships, but not insisting [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=196.28s)]
*  on any condition that they stop bombing Israeli ships, where this is something the Israelis [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=201.88s)]
*  weren't involved in and they only learned about it afterwards. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=205.12s)]
*  This is unheard of for the U.S. to do anything in the Middle East without Israel right by [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=209.04000000000002s)]
*  its side making sure that Israel is pleased with whatever it is that we're doing and has [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=214.16s)]
*  a veto power over it as well. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=217.66s)]
*  In these two cases and others, as we'll show you, Trump has completely dispensed with that [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=219.7s)]
*  publicly. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=223.82s)]
*  Here from the Times of Israel, they're talking about this a lot in Israel as well. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=225.5s)]
*  Quote, source, U.S. didn't brief Israel on efforts to free Eden Alexander until after [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=229.85999999999999s)]
*  a deal was reached. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=235.22s)]
*  I thought Trump's language that notified the world of this deal was extremely notable as [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=238.22s)]
*  well. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=247.82s)]
*  He said this, I am happy to announce that Eden Alexander, an American citizen who has [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=248.82s)]
*  been held hostage since October 2023, is coming home to his family. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=252.54s)]
*  I'm grateful to all those involved in making this monumental news happen. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=255.86s)]
*  This was a step taken in good faith toward the United States and the efforts of the mediators, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=260.34s)]
*  Qatar and Egypt, to put an end to this very brutal war, put an end to this very brutal [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=264.54s)]
*  war and return all living hostages and their remains to their loved ones. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=269.82s)]
*  Hopefully this is the first step of those final steps necessary to end this brutal conflict. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=273.82s)]
*  I look very much forward to that day of celebration. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=278.42s)]
*  So you notice there that Trump in thinking the people who made it happen didn't mention [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=281.42s)]
*  Israel at all, even though this is an IDF soldier that the U.S. got released. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=286.38s)]
*  This is now Trump repeatedly calling for an end to the war in Gaza. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=295.21999999999997s)]
*  Now again, Trump did facilitate a ceasefire that was meaningful at the time. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=299.42s)]
*  The Palestinians celebrated it. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=305.82s)]
*  And Netanyahu from the beginning was saying it's not a real ceasefire deal. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=308.7s)]
*  We're not actually going to go through with it. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=311.42s)]
*  We're just going to get some of our hostages back and go back to fighting. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=312.7s)]
*  And that's what ended up happening. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=316.02s)]
*  But now you have Trump doing something Biden never did, which is saying this war has to [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=318.21999999999997s)]
*  end now. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=321.94s)]
*  Here was Netanyahu's announcement earlier today trying to make it seem as though he [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=324.58s)]
*  was OK with this, even though the Israeli media is reporting that he's enraged. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=328.46s)]
*  Here he is saying that he's just so very happy for the release of this American hostage. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=333.7s)]
*  This is a very emotional moment. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=338.78s)]
*  Eden Alexander has returned home. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=341.7s)]
*  We embrace him and we embrace his family. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=343.65999999999997s)]
*  This was achieved thanks to our military pressure and the diplomatic pressure applied by President [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=347.66s)]
*  Trump. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=352.70000000000005s)]
*  This is a winning combination. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=353.70000000000005s)]
*  I spoke with President Trump today. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=356.1s)]
*  He told me I am committed to Israel. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=357.90000000000003s)]
*  I am committed to continuing to work with you in close cooperation in order to achieve [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=359.90000000000003s)]
*  all of our war objectives, releasing all of the hostages and defeating Hamas. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=364.78000000000003s)]
*  That goes together. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=369.74s)]
*  They are combined with each other. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=370.74s)]
*  Now Israel has been using incomprehensible military force against a largely civilian [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=373.9s)]
*  population of two million people for a year and six months. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=381.97999999999996s)]
*  And at no point did Hamas release Alexander. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=391.29999999999995s)]
*  They often offered hostage deals and as the Israeli press has reported continuously, in [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=397.58s)]
*  fact there was a big news report on Channel 12 News, a mainstream Israeli television outlet [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=403.46s)]
*  that's very supportive of the government, that Netanyahu has constantly stood in the [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=407.78000000000003s)]
*  way of getting hostages released because he doesn't want the hostages released because [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=411.06s)]
*  the Israeli public has made clear that they want an end to the war in exchange for bringing [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=415.22s)]
*  the hostages back. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=420.58s)]
*  And so the minute the hostages are back, it's much more difficult for Netanyahu to justify [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=422.98s)]
*  the continuation of this war and therefore to keep himself out of prosecution and corruption [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=427.86s)]
*  trials and all the things that face him if he's finally out of office. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=433.38000000000005s)]
*  Here is Barack Ravid, the former IDF intelligence officer who now works as a journalist reporting [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=439.06s)]
*  on Israel for Axios who said this on Twitter, on X. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=445.20000000000005s)]
*  Breaking, after meeting with White House envoy Steve Witkoff, Netanyahu is sending Israeli [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=449.74s)]
*  negotiators to Doha to resume talks on a broader hostage and ceasefire deal, Prime [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=454.14s)]
*  Minister Hafez said. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=460.26s)]
*  Now, this is something the Israelis have not really been doing in any sort of good faith. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=461.26s)]
*  The Israelis have said, Joe Biden, we're so grateful for him. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=467.21999999999997s)]
*  Never at any point did he tell us, I'm pressuring you to enter a ceasefire. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=470.34s)]
*  At no point did he even say that, even though Kamala Harris and Joe Biden and their lackeys [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=475.18s)]
*  in the press were saying, oh, they're working tirelessly on a ceasefire. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=481.28s)]
*  The Israelis say, no, actually, they never even pushed us to get a ceasefire. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=484.28s)]
*  And now you have Trump on his way to the Gulf states, where he'll visit Qatar, the United [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=489.68s)]
*  of the Emirates and Saudi Arabia, saying that we want the Israelis to go and meet with negotiators [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=496.76s)]
*  and mediators of Hamas in Qatar, with Qatar mediating, and Trump could mediate as well [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=503.9s)]
*  to try and bring an end to this war. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=508.64s)]
*  Trump wants an end to this war. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=510.12s)]
*  In the Jerusalem Post yesterday, they quoted Trump's Middle East envoy as saying, quote [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=513.8s)]
*  this, we want to bring hostages home, but Israel is not willing to end the war, Witkoff [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=521.16s)]
*  says. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=526.28s)]
*  The Trump administration's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, criticized Israel in a meeting [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=527.28s)]
*  with hostage families, according to a Sunday evening report by Channel 12, quote, we want [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=531.68s)]
*  to bring the hostages home, but Israel is not willing to end the war. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=536.24s)]
*  Israel is prolonging it, despite the fact that we don't see where else we can go and [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=539.32s)]
*  that an agreement must be reached, Witkoff commented during the meeting, according to [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=543.5600000000001s)]
*  sources present. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=547.5200000000001s)]
*  However, he added an optimistic message, saying, quote, there is currently an opportunity window [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=548.5200000000001s)]
*  that we hope Israel and all the mediators will take advantage of. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=552.6400000000001s)]
*  We are putting pressure on all the mediators and doing everything we can to bring the hostages [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=555.5600000000001s)]
*  home. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=559.96s)]
*  Now, again, this is nothing more than a critique and a complaint that the families of these [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=560.96s)]
*  making with increasing vehemence, blaming Netanyahu for passing on one opportunity after the next [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=565.26s)]
*  to bring their loved ones home, even though for a few months the idea was of Israel and [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=573.86s)]
*  its supporters in the US, oh no, this war is about, just give us our hostages. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=580.86s)]
*  If we must release the hostages, the war would be over. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=584.22s)]
*  And Netanyahu kept saying, no, that's not the goal of the war. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=587.9399999999999s)]
*  They could release all the hostages tomorrow and this war will continue for a long time. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=590.98s)]
*  Obviously, they said that their goal was to destroy Hamas. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=595.98s)]
*  Their real goal, which they're now admitting, is to continuously expand the Israeli military [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=599.46s)]
*  footprint inside Gaza paid for by the United States. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=605.98s)]
*  They want to destroy every last standing building in Gaza, just completely turn it into a parking [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=610.54s)]
*  lot. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=615.58s)]
*  They want to either force the Palestinians to leave, which is obviously the only reason [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=617.06s)]
*  why you would destroy all civilian life and infrastructure in Gaza, force them out of [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=621.06s)]
*  their land so that you can take it over, or they're going to build a concentration camp. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=625.06s)]
*  That's what they call it. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=630.34s)]
*  They said there are going to be zones, concentrated zones, that the Palestinians can stay in inside [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=631.62s)]
*  those. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=638.62s)]
*  They cannot leave and maybe they'll get some food and water. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=639.62s)]
*  But the Israeli plan is obvious and explicit at this point. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=644.3399999999999s)]
*  It has nothing to do with any of the stated war aims at the beginning, which is true of [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=648.02s)]
*  most wars. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=652.4599999999999s)]
*  And the United States is paying for all of this in many, many ways, not just financially [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=653.4599999999999s)]
*  and militarily, but also in terms of its standing in the world. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=657.9399999999999s)]
*  Here from Heretz on May 8, quote, Israeli army places were turning the hostages at the [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=663.8199999999999s)]
*  bottom of its Gaza war goals despite promises to the families. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=668.54s)]
*  Quote, despite promises made to the public and the hostage families by Israeli army chief [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=673.78s)]
*  of staff, Ayl Zameer, that the return of the hostages is a top priority of the planned [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=678.1800000000001s)]
*  Gaza expansion campaign, the operational orders presented to commanders on Tuesday put that [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=683.26s)]
*  goal at the bottom of the list. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=687.7s)]
*  Many of the commanders attending the briefing were also surprised that the Israeli defense [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=690.1800000000001s)]
*  forces had substituted the usual Hebrew word used to refer to the hostages, hatufin, with [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=693.74s)]
*  the less politically charged term bani aruba, which also implies they're being used as leverage. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=700.22s)]
*  The briefing began with a presentation of the operations goal, which were listed in [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=706.58s)]
*  order as, quote, defeating Hamas, operational control of the territory, demilitarization [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=709.82s)]
*  of the territory, destroying sites of Hamas' rule, concentration and movement of the population, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=715.34s)]
*  and last, returning the hostages. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=722.6600000000001s)]
*  Many of those attending the briefing were surprised at the list of priorities because [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=725.24s)]
*  they had been told in discussions with the chief of staff that bringing back the hostages [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=728.22s)]
*  was the main goal of the war. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=731.38s)]
*  It was never the main goal of the war. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=733.18s)]
*  It was the pretext for the war to pion people's emotions. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=734.46s)]
*  Netanyahu has had so many opportunities to get those hostages back. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=737.42s)]
*  It's not me saying this. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=742.38s)]
*  The Israeli media is saying this, mainstream pro-Netanyahu television outlets that are [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=745.6999999999999s)]
*  just reporting in the hostages' family that he has no interest in getting those hostages [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=749.74s)]
*  back. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=753.7s)]
*  And that's why the US went around Israel to get this one American citizen back. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=755.5400000000001s)]
*  This is really American IDF soldier back because they knew Israel would impede it. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=760.22s)]
*  They had to get it done themselves, and they directly negotiated with Hamas without Israel. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=764.86s)]
*  Again, another unprecedented act that you would exclude Israel from participating in. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=769.26s)]
*  I was watching an interview the other day with a woman who was in her 40s, was married [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=779.1s)]
*  and had kids, and she was saying how she really wishes that she still could be in college, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=783.1800000000001s)]
*  that she actually misses college. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=789.1800000000001s)]
*  And when somebody said, how could you possibly do that? [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=790.86s)]
*  She said, I think it's sad that now we're basically told that our learning is over. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=793.22s)]
*  And that is a common view, that once you get into life, into the stages of life that are [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=797.74s)]
*  more advanced, it means that your time to study is actually over. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=802.94s)]
*  And on top of that, you have the internet that's frying our brains and making it harder [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=806.94s)]
*  even if we want to. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=809.98s)]
*  Hillsdale College is the perfect solution to all of that. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=811.58s)]
*  It offers more than 40 free online courses. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=815.18s)]
*  That's right, more than 40 free online courses. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=820.14s)]
*  You can learn about the works of C.S. Lewis or the stories in the book of Genesis, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=822.78s)]
*  which have remarkable relevance to our public debates. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=826.46s)]
*  I actually just read the first five books of the Old Testament, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=829.74s)]
*  and it's what so many people cite to this day as their guiding light for how they understand [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=833.9s)]
*  political debates. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=840.62s)]
*  You can take a class on the meaning of the U.S. Constitution, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=841.26s)]
*  or the rise and fall of the Roman Republic, or the history of the ancient Christian churches [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=844.0600000000001s)]
*  with Hillsdale College's free online courses. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=847.98s)]
*  Personally, I've recommended different ones throughout the months when Hillsdale has been [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=852.0600000000001s)]
*  sponsoring our program, that I really love the course, the history of classical music, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=856.22s)]
*  Pythagoras through Beethoven, which is taught by the celebrated pianist, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=860.38s)]
*  and Hillsdale College distinguished and fellow Hyperion Knight. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=864.22s)]
*  This free five-lesson course explains how music has developed and what distinguishes [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=868.22s)]
*  the greatest musical achievements in the life of Beethoven. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=871.9s)]
*  It's something totally different from the topics I usually follow or read about, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=874.78s)]
*  and it's turning out very stimulating, very interesting. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=878.3000000000001s)]
*  It keeps your mind active and growing. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=881.34s)]
*  As someone who is not at all trained in music theory, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=883.34s)]
*  it has been really insightful to discover what it is that makes music great [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=885.4200000000001s)]
*  and how that has evolved over history. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=888.94s)]
*  The course is self-paced, so you can start and watch whenever you want. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njeD9R-hxbo&t=890.38s)]
