# Hunter Biden Laptop Authenticated by FBI Agent After Media Smeared Story as Russian Disinfo
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [June 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ)
*  Now I frequently said that I think one of the gravest journalistic scandals of the past [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=0.0s)]
*  five years is the way in which the corporate media in the weeks before the 2020 election [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=11.96s)]
*  decided that they did not want to report on or talk about extremely incriminating reporting [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=19.04s)]
*  that was first published by the New York Post and then other media outlets that was not about [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=25.32s)]
*  Hunter Biden's private life that was never the issue instead it was about the way in which Joe [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=30.36s)]
*  Biden's family and often Joe Biden himself was trading on his name and influence to seek and [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=35.52s)]
*  obtain profit and other business deals in places like Ukraine and China where obviously they knew [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=41.68s)]
*  he would exercise great influence if he ran for president and won. That was what that reporting [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=47.16s)]
*  was about. It was highly incriminating of Joe Biden and his family and the way that they are [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=53.44s)]
*  willing to use power and influence to corruptly profit in foreign places and because the media [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=56.839999999999996s)]
*  was so desperate to protect Joe Biden in the weeks headed to the 2020 election not do anything [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=63.16s)]
*  to allow any reporting that might have harmed his chances of winning that election they took a lie [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=68.4s)]
*  from the intelligence agency. These former intelligence operatives like John Brennan and [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=74.44s)]
*  James Clapper people who reviled Trump manufactured a complete fabrication they just decided to issue [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=81.60000000000001s)]
*  a letter saying we think the Hunter Biden laptop has all the hallmarks of a Russian disinformation [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=89.28s)]
*  campaign and the corporate media took that letter which had no evidence and even in the letter even [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=96.48s)]
*  those intel officials admitted they had no evidence for that claim and they converted it into an [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  absolute truth and they spent weeks on the air and in print repeating this claim over and over [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=109.0s)]
*  that reporting based on documents from Hunter Biden's laptop could not be confirmed and might [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=115.0s)]
*  even probably should be ignored because it was a Russian disinformation campaign. As you might [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=119.92s)]
*  recall this was in the weeks before the 2020 election that was when I wanted to write about [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=127.60000000000001s)]
*  the contents of the Hunter Biden laptop and the documents on it and what it revealed about Joe [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=132.52s)]
*  Biden but I was banned by the intercept my the media outlet that I had founded and where I was [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=137.24s)]
*  reporting from even mentioning the contents of the laptop because a week earlier they too had [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=142.32000000000002s)]
*  ratified and spread the CIA lie that these documents were Russian disinformation. Now since [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=148.56s)]
*  the election happened and Joe Biden was declared the winner safely put into the White House almost [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=155.4s)]
*  every one of these same media outlets purported to be able to now authenticate that the Hunter [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=162.12s)]
*  Biden laptop was never Russian disinformation was never anything than fully authentic and unaltered [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=167.96s)]
*  in fact began using documents from his laptop to do a whole wide array of reporting. Obviously they [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=173.4s)]
*  had concluded that those documents which were obviously authentic before the election and they [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=179.56s)]
*  were after the election they were willing to admit it and I've always regarded this is such a grave [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=185.28s)]
*  journalistic scandal because they lied over and over they took a CIA lie exaggerated it even further [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=191.84s)]
*  and spread it over and over even though it was a complete lie to dismiss reporting about Joe Biden [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=197.44s)]
*  that could have harmed his election chances because they were so desperate to ensure that Trump was [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=204.88s)]
*  defeated. Now it's one thing to have watched all these corporate media outlets admit that the [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=209.64000000000001s)]
*  laptop was authentic all along which they've done but something happened today in the courtroom [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=214.68s)]
*  where Hunter Biden is being prosecuted by the federal government for a wide range of crimes [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=220.64s)]
*  including lying on an application for a gun permit where he has to certify that he's not abusing drugs [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=225.64s)]
*  when in fact he was and other banking and tax claims. In order to prosecute Joe Biden the FBI [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=230.83999999999997s)]
*  needs to use to prove his guilt the documents from that laptop that's a major part of their [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=237.23999999999998s)]
*  case and so obviously they need to put an FBI agent on the witness stand and have her testify [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=244.2s)]
*  under oath that she was able to confirm the FBI was able to confirm that the Hunter Biden laptop [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=249.52s)]
*  in the contents of it were in fact authentic and that's exactly what the FBI agent did today she [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=254.04000000000002s)]
*  took the stand and under oath testified about how it is that the FBI confirmed that the documents [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=260.84000000000003s)]
*  on which they're relying for this investigation and for this prosecution are in fact authentic [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=267.96000000000004s)]
*  and not Russian disinformation at all. Here from NBC News which was one of the outlets most [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=271.72s)]
*  aggressively spreading this lie Hunter Biden trial highlights FBI agent testifies about [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=277.44s)]
*  Hunter Biden's drug use and large cash withdrawals the agent a witness for the prosecution testified [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=283.08s)]
*  about the authenticity of Hunter Biden's laptop which has been the subject of rumors and speculation [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=289.79999999999995s)]
*  for years not yes not just rumors of speculation but lies it's been the subject of lies for years [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=296.28s)]
*  and not by trolls on the internet but by our leading media outlets and the leaders of our [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=302.36s)]
*  intelligence agencies and Democratic Party operatives as a reminder here was a tweet from [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=309.88s)]
*  Jen Psaki the current MSNBC host and former Biden administration press secretary who tweeted on [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=316.84000000000003s)]
*  October 19th 2020 Hunter Biden's story is Russian disinformation dozens of former Intel officials [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=324.40000000000003s)]
*  say and she cited the first article ever published on this by the serial liar Natasha Bertrand and you [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=330.84s)]
*  see here that the letter said we believe it has all the hallmarks of Russian disinformation though [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=339.0s)]
*  we can't prove it and in the hands of Jen Psaki and Natasha Bertrand in Politico it morphed into [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=345.0s)]
*  the far more definitive claim which you see right on the screen the hunt in that tweet the Hunter [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=350.35999999999996s)]
*  Biden story is Russian disinformation dozens of former Intel officials say do you see how the [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=355.32s)]
*  people who constantly claim that you have to rely on them to combat disinformation are in fact the [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=361.32s)]
*  people who spread disinformation most aggressively and most casually just to give you a small sense [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=367.08s)]
*  of what the media was doing on the airwaves in the weeks and days leading up to the 2020 election [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=376.03999999999996s)]
*  to protect Joe Biden here was CNN who put James Clapper on their show and you see their U.S. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=381.8s)]
*  officials investigating if recently published emails are tied to Russian disinformation ever [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=391.16s)]
*  targeting Biden they barely ever talked about the contents of the reporting they instead tried to [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=396.12s)]
*  lie about it to call into question and even deny its authenticity by claiming it was Russian [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=402.92s)]
*  disinformation when all along it never was and I was so convinced before the 2020 election that [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=408.36s)]
*  it was completely authentic based on the same methods I had used to authenticate other archives [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=416.36s)]
*  exactly the same ones used for the Snowden reporting for WikiLeaks for the big Brazil [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=421.08000000000004s)]
*  investigation that we did where we had to authenticate large archives before putting [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=425.96000000000004s)]
*  our name and credibility on at stake I could see that this archive was completely authentic and yet [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=429.88s)]
*  the intercept was one of the media outlets created to oppose propaganda from the U.S. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=434.6s)]
*  security state that instead published this lie as well saying the CIA has warned that this archive [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=439.32000000000005s)]
*  is Russian disinformation and then prevented me from reporting on it on that basis until I finally [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=446.20000000000005s)]
*  quit that's how devoted they are and committed they were to this lie because it was so important [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=450.52000000000004s)]
*  to them not to do anything to risk Biden's election even if it meant doing their jobs [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=456.12s)]
*  as journalists and reporting authentic documents not a single one of those outlets has ever [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=460.2s)]
*  accounted for explained apologized for or retracted any of these eyes listen to the stuff that they [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=467.24s)]
*  were just constantly putting on air there was a 20-minute montage that was excellent by a [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=472.76s)]
*  Twitter user called Kanoka the great and I published it on my Twitter feed as well but [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=481.88s)]
*  it's 20 minutes I'm not going to show you that but it's just and it's just a partial iceberg tip [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=485.64s)]
*  of the iceberg of how these media outlets just over and over and over and over again told people [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=491.56s)]
*  to ignore this reporting because it was Russian disinformation here's what James Clapper the [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=497.0s)]
*  former director of national intelligence under President Obama and at the time a CNN analyst [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=501.88s)]
*  went on the air and talked and said with Aaron Burnett listen to this Obama so director a bunch [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=508.28s)]
*  of questions from this let me just start with this how much does the source matter right to hear [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=513.88s)]
*  the story of this laptop we don't know a lot we do know that the the way that this information is [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=519.0s)]
*  getting out is through Steve Bannon and Rudy Giuliani how much do the does the source matter here [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=523.72s)]
*  well source matters a lot and and the timing matters a lot I think and to me this is [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=531.24s)]
*  this classic textbook Soviet Russian by the way you see here James Clapper CNN national security [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=538.1999999999999s)]
*  analyst just before that he's identified as former director of national intelligence to me [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=546.1999999999999s)]
*  just this graphic alone shows the complete union of the US intelligence security state the [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=551.48s)]
*  intelligence community and corporate media this used to be clandestine the CIA and intelligence [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=558.52s)]
*  agencies would use secret programs to influence media outlets they wouldn't do it out in the open [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=564.68s)]
*  now it's just right out in the open they go right from the CIA or the FBI or DHS or the NSA [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=570.28s)]
*  right to the newsrooms of all these corporate media outlets where they are presented as the [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=576.28s)]
*  experts that you should believe the trained liars of the US security state who are presenting the [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=579.64s)]
*  news and here's what they had James Clapper saying uh this classic textbook Soviet Russian [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=584.12s)]
*  tradecraft at work the Russians have analyzed the target they understand that the president [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=592.76s)]
*  and his enablers crave dirt on vice president Biden whether it's real or contrived that doesn't [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=599.16s)]
*  matter to them and so all of a sudden two two and a half weeks before the election this laptop [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=607.0s)]
*  appears somehow without and the emails on it without any metadata it just it's all very curious [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=614.36s)]
*  but the so here you have a willing target and the Russians who are very sophisticated about it [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=622.44s)]
*  and here you see on the screen as well Washington Post quote White House was warned that Giuliani [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=628.92s)]
*  was being used by the Russians to quote feed misinformation to Trump so the entire media project [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=633.72s)]
*  was to join with the US intelligence agency when their whole function supposedly is to be adversarial [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=641.8s)]
*  to it and to join together with them and to ratify this lie to convince the American people that this [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=647.0799999999999s)]
*  reporting was based on fabrications that came from Russia the same strip they had been using against [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=654.68s)]
*  Trump for four years of course and you had Jen Psaki spreading it and then when Donald Trump [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=661.56s)]
*  brought it up in the debates to say look at all these documents that show how your family was [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=667.48s)]
*  corruptly seeking profit in places like Ukraine and China Biden immediately said oh you're just [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=674.1999999999999s)]
*  doing the Kremlin's work and spreading Russian disinformation one time a reporter asked Biden [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQH36J0i-tQ&t=679.48s)]
