# Law Could Give Americans 20 Years IN PRISON for Breaking Israel Boycott?
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [May 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E)
*  Viewers of this program understand of course that one of the things that we have most focused [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=0.0s)]
*  on since President Trump's inauguration and really before because a lot of it was foreseeable [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=12.34s)]
*  is the onslaught of attacks that are coming from Washington on the core civil liberty [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=17.96s)]
*  rights of Americans including free speech and the right to petition the government and [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=23.2s)]
*  academic freedom seeming every day the Trump administration or the Congress or various [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=29.16s)]
*  officials issue some new order some new measure some new law some new resolution some new [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=34.44s)]
*  executive order that seems to have as its only goal and sometimes you think that this [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=40.14s)]
*  is what American politicians do more than anything else is to protect the people of [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=45.16s)]
*  Israel and the government of Israel but apparently by forcing Americans to give up many of their [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=49.44s)]
*  rights of many of our most important defining rights and we've seen that over and over in [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=55.919999999999995s)]
*  so many of the laws that we've talked about including the anti-Semitism awareness act [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=60.92s)]
*  there's a new law though that had not been getting much attention until today when an [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=65.0s)]
*  excellent reporter Matthew Petty who is an assistant editor at Reason wrote about them [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=69.12s)]
*  he joins us tonight for that article which is entitled should sharing information about [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=73.92s)]
*  Israeli businesses get you 20 years in prison sort of a headline that answers itself he [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=79.24s)]
*  has previously reported for the BBC the intercept the daily beast new lines magazine responsible [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=85.4s)]
*  statecraft Middle East the national interest and many others he covers use national security [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=91.04s)]
*  policy in his interactions with American society and domestic politics and will forgive him [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=95.96000000000001s)]
*  for having worked with the intercept because of how good this article today was all right [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=100.36000000000001s)]
*  Matthew great to see you thanks so much for coming on talk to us. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=105.88000000000001s)]
*  Oh thank you for having me I've been a huge fan ever since you know the Snowden leaks. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=109.0s)]
*  Thank you thank you I appreciate that all right let me ask you makes me feel a little [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=115.12s)]
*  old but I nonetheless appreciate it let me ask you you know as I said we've been covering [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=119.36s)]
*  a seemingly you know relentless onslaught of these kinds of measures and honestly even [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=125.36s)]
*  somebody who's been around for a while I kind of can't believe just from like a PR or perception [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=132.56s)]
*  perspective that they're just willing like almost seemingly every day to unveil some [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=137.46s)]
*  policy or measure that has no real effect on the lives of American people and is really [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=142.88s)]
*  explicitly about Israel and some of them have been quite radical quite extremists we've [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=147.12s)]
*  we've all talked about them and so one of the things that caught my attention in what [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=151.84s)]
*  you said is that this arguably might be the most kind of extreme or dangerous type of [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=156.96s)]
*  law of this kind I think we're talking about regulating boycott but free speech more broadly [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=163.16s)]
*  we haven't actually covered this I've kind of fell under the radar but it was seemingly [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=168.24s)]
*  making its way through Congress so I'm glad you did tell us about the specific background [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=172.56s)]
*  and development of this law and what specifically in it makes it so menacing sure so the US has [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=178.32000000000002s)]
*  actually had anti-boycott regulations on the books since the 70s because the Carter administration [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=186.32000000000002s)]
*  ironically enough given where Jimmy Carter is today and on his or where he was on his [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=193.36s)]
*  politics before he passed passed basically regulations meant to prevent American businesses [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=198.24s)]
*  from complying with foreign sanctions against a friendly country and it was explicitly in [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=204.32s)]
*  response to the Arab League embargo against Israel so if you're an American company doing [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=209.44s)]
*  business abroad and the government asks you to sign a paper that says I will boycott this [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=214.16s)]
*  third country then you are supposed to report that to the US government and refuse to sign [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=218.8s)]
*  which is already I think kind of a heavy-handed measure but this is you know a foreign policy [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=224.8s)]
*  measure that Europe has something similar ironically enough European countries are [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=231.36s)]
*  supposed to defy US sanctions on Cuba for example and then in the can I interject can I just [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=235.28s)]
*  interject there to clarify just one thing about that sort of the words like in that case and in [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=241.84s)]
*  the 1977 prohibition on these kinds of boycotts it wasn't enough if you say hey I'm gonna boycott [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=248.08s)]
*  country acts just speak it wasn't enough to criminalize it just because say like some [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=255.92000000000002s)]
*  Middle East country also supported boycott acts the idea here was is that what we want to avoid [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=261.6s)]
*  specifically is Americans complying with coerced or required boycotts like if you want to do [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=267.2s)]
*  business in Saudi Arabia they're like yeah you can do business here you just have to agree to [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=274.0s)]
*  submit to and comply with this boycott that we want to impose on an ally the United States that [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=277.84s)]
*  the government itself doesn't support right that it wasn't like a someone in their own discretion [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=282.48s)]
*  or judgment joining a boycott it was one they were forced to by some foreign government [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=287.52s)]
*  yes yes exactly and you're also not supposed to snitch on business competitors to foreign [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=292.64s)]
*  governments and you know within the 2010s you have the rise of the boycott divest sanctions [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=297.68s)]
*  movement which the bds movement in which Palestinians were calling for foreigners to [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=304.24s)]
*  personally boycott Israeli businesses that are seen as complicit with sort of Israeli military [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=309.84000000000003s)]
*  rule in Palestine and then the UN in 2016 said it was actually going to come out it the UN didn't [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=317.36s)]
*  explicitly endorse a boycott but it said it was going to come out with a list of businesses that [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=325.28s)]
*  were complicit in human rights violations against Palestinians and then you see this mobilization [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=330.23999999999995s)]
*  by the government of Israel and its foreign supporters to you know adopt the anti-boycott [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=335.84s)]
*  measures from the 70s to something that could be used against personal political boycotts or sort [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=341.91999999999996s)]
*  of like non-governmental boycotts and in 2018 they changed it from like a just a trade violation to a [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=348.0s)]
*  criminal violation to either boycott or furnish information or refuse to report a boycott request [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=355.76s)]
*  and this latest bill would have broadened it from foreign governments to any kind of international [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=362.56s)]
*  organization like the UN or the EU which then could arguably be used to say well as you said [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=369.2s)]
*  it's not just the government of Saudi Arabia saying sign this paper this is like the UN [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=376.64s)]
*  saying these businesses are violating human rights and then if the business changes its behavior the [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=381.52s)]
*  US government can come after them and say you know you are criminally liable of for [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=387.35999999999996s)]
*  for an unauthorized boycott so that's what I want to actually get [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=393.84s)]
*  clarification on as well because that's an important distinction so aside from the 1977 law [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=399.35999999999996s)]
*  that was sort of enacted to say to Americans we don't want you by complying with these Middle [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=405.36s)]
*  East countries who are forcing you to boycott Israel as well as other cases as well but that [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=410.24s)]
*  was the kind of nature of it there was this precursor to the one now that you mentioned that [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=414.56s)]
*  came in 2018 under the first Trump administration that Congress passed that was a little bit similar [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=419.52000000000004s)]
*  in that it said we don't want you engaging in boycotts of countries we like if there's some [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=425.44s)]
*  international body like the UN or the EU that also is supporting the boycott and this was basically [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=433.44s)]
*  for companies right so like if you're doing business in the EU or the UN we don't want you [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=442.24s)]
*  then complying with these boycotts from these other from these other international institutions [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=446.4s)]
*  so what is what are the primary changes between that 2018 law and feel free to talk about the [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=453.68s)]
*  problem with that one if you want but this much more extreme version that until it got a lot of [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=458.88s)]
*  attention including from some MAGA people who raised their voices in opposition seemed to be [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=463.92s)]
*  headed toward passage well the 2018 law actually didn't did not so in 2018 they attempted to [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=469.44s)]
*  pass this law that they're currently trying to pass which brought international organizations [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=477.52s)]
*  into it all the 2018 all they successfully did in 2018 was a criminal penalty to the existing [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=482.24s)]
*  anti-boycott statute so if you sign that piece of paper that Saudi Arabia for example is demanding [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=488.88s)]
*  you sign not only are you can your business be fined but you're also can be sent to jail and [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=494.08s)]
*  again the violations are not just if you sign the piece of paper it's also if you furnish information [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=500.08s)]
*  on other people doing business with Israel or if you refuse to report this demand to the US [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=506.88s)]
*  government now this law that that's that was about to be voted on and sort of got frozen [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=514.8s)]
*  that was going to add the UN and EU boycotts and and they've been trying to do this for a while [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=521.6s)]
*  there is an Israeli government strategy memo that they had like commissioned some American [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=526.32s)]
*  consultants to write in 2016 when the UN first came out with this blacklist and the Israeli [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=532.48s)]
*  government consultants said internally okay the way we're going to fight this is by getting [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=537.76s)]
*  American laws changed so that the anti-boycott statute can apply to the UN but every time they've [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=543.9200000000001s)]
*  tried to do that in Congress it's sort of it's the the bill has died because I think a lot of [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=551.04s)]
*  members just don't want to have to publicly take a stance on that issue and so the leadership sort [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=556.08s)]
*  of kills it what's different now is that it's not democratic leadership killing it it's it's [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=561.44s)]
*  republicans doing that and that well there's this part about the law and I'm not sure why you're [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=565.2800000000001s)]
*  you were talking about this part uh and when you were saying snitching on businesses or um telling [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=572.96s)]
*  people about these companies but one of the parts of the law that I think is already in the 2018 law [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=578.08s)]
*  but correct me if I'm wrong but it's definitely in the 2025 one is that it's not just that you're [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=584.0s)]
*  criminally barred under this pending bill if you participate in a boycott that the EU or the UN or [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=590.08s)]
*  some international group also participates in but that you're not even allowed to when I say you're [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=598.48s)]
*  not allowed to it could be a crime publish information that would help other people boycott [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=604.24s)]
*  so example you know journalists that's what I'm talking about yeah I'm a journalist and when I [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=609.2800000000001s)]
*  like you know a lot of people don't know like hey if I'm boycotting Israel and like there's been [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=613.84s)]
*  zillions of boycotts like it's not like Israel's the first company to be boypotted in fact there [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=618.16s)]
*  were very powerful boycotts in the last like six years against North Carolina and Indiana for their [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=621.68s)]
*  bathroom bill against Georgia for their voting rights bill I mean obviously the big boycott [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=626.8s)]
*  movement which the Israelis fear most was the 1980s anti-apartheid activism that also started [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=632.8s)]
*  on college campuses um but the idea here is like okay you want to you know divest from Israeli [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=638.48s)]
*  companies until they create a Palestinian state or get out of the West Bank or you want to you [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=644.8s)]
*  know avoid Israeli institutions or companies that do business obviously you have to know like what [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=651.76s)]
*  those companies are most people don't know them and then you go to like a site that is an official [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=656.88s)]
*  boycott site or maybe reporters report on that it seems like this law if it becomes enacted would [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=661.3599999999999s)]
*  actually criminalize even if you're not participating the boycott of Israel if you're publishing [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=668.0799999999999s)]
*  information that encourages or enables others to do so so I don't know specifically whether they'd [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=672.08s)]
*  be able to enforce it against journalists but it certainly would criminalize like providing [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=678.72s)]
*  information that to be used in the UN blacklist that's really what this law was aimed at it's [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=683.44s)]
*  at the UN list and again like this this UN list is not it's not like oh the government of some [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=688.72s)]
*  country is monitoring America to see who does business in Israel it's it's so that they can [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=694.88s)]
*  you know snatch them up it's it's publishing you know publicly available information about [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=699.28s)]
*  what foreign companies are doing in the West Bank with Israeli settlements and this again this law [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=705.68s)]
*  is an earlier version of it specifically mentioned the UN blacklist this 2025 version of the bill [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=710.9599999999999s)]
*  does not but it's the exact same law and the Israeli government strategy memo said this is [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=716.88s)]
*  what we're trying to do we're trying to make it so that you cannot basically you know contribute [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=721.8399999999999s)]
*  to this this list that's going around yeah by by providing basically accurate factual information [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=727.36s)]
*  about what these companies are doing in the in the West Bank that's another aspect of this I wanted [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=735.44s)]
*  to bring up is you know they're not just trying to prevent boycotts of Israel the country as a whole [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=739.6800000000001s)]
*  they're trying to prevent specific targeted boycotts at Israeli actions in the Palestinian [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=745.28s)]
*  territories and I think the big example of this was Ben and Jerry's the ice cream company said [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=749.92s)]
*  in I think 2021 they said you know we are going to continue doing business in Israel we have a [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=755.92s)]
*  factory there we're going to sell to Israeli supermarkets but we're not going to let our [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=761.36s)]
*  distributors sell to Israeli settlements in the Palestinian territories because that we disagree [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=765.12s)]
*  with and a lot of states because a lot of states already have their own anti-boycott statutes [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=770.4s)]
*  basically tried to say well Ben and Jerry's you're boycotting Israel even though they went out of [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=776.56s)]
*  their way to say we're not boycotting the state of Israel we're boycotting a specific Israeli policy [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=780.7199999999999s)]
*  you know I want to ask you I think a lot of people assume that all of this stuff or most of it has [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=786.56s)]
*  been coming in response to October 7th and the student protests that were so effectively demonized [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=792.56s)]
*  around the country where people were protesting obviously not Jews but the Israeli devastation [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=799.68s)]
*  of the civilian population of Gaza that we all watch for ourselves and the reality is is is way [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=807.04s)]
*  different I mean obviously the 2018 boycott law that you were just describing under the Trump [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=812.16s)]
*  administration proceeded October 7th by five or six years but beyond that there's this and I've [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=817.04s)]
*  done a lot of reporting on this it frustrates me because no matter how much you talk about it people [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=823.1999999999999s)]
*  still don't realize it I think it's not up to 37 states but 34 something in that vicinity that [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=827.12s)]
*  have a law that they enacted that say if you want to have a contract with the state you're a private [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=835.28s)]
*  citizen and let's say like you're a freelance educator who helps kids with a certain learning [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=842.56s)]
*  disability but you're not a full-time employee maybe a small construction company that gets [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=848.48s)]
*  hired by the city or the county to do like some reforms on buildings or whatever is a requirement [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=852.64s)]
*  of that contract that before it can be approved you have to sign a loyalty pledge saying that you [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=859.52s)]
*  will not support or participate in a boycott of Israel you're allowed to support a boycott of [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=865.6s)]
*  literally any other country in the world including the United States you can support a boycott of [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=871.04s)]
*  other American states because like I said for a long time now what has feared what what Israel has [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=874.8s)]
*  feared the most is the possibility of a growing boycott movement against Israel because that's [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=881.1999999999999s)]
*  what took down south after that they succeeded in getting the EU to adopt laws saying an advocacy [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=885.6s)]
*  of a boycott of Israel by definition is anti-semitic and therefore illegal or even criminal in many EU [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=891.44s)]
*  states what do you who is behind this this new law and like out of what sort of cultural assumptions [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=898.08s)]
*  is it emerging so the sponsor of the law were Mike Lawler and Josh Gottheimer and Gottheimer is my [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=906.0s)]
*  member of congress so I can I've written extensively I don't know if it's uh [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=913.04s)]
*  verboten to to refer to my intercept work here but I've written no I already said I forgive you for [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=917.1999999999999s)]
*  that and I did a little of my own as well so you're not I'm not on very solid ground criticizing you [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=922.7199999999999s)]
*  for that well look there is an article I wrote last year about Josh Gottheimer's war with local [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=928.88s)]
*  high school protesters that I think is worth reading first of all because it goes way beyond [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=935.5999999999999s)]
*  college campuses it's uh against minor children which is kind of strange also because there's [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=941.68s)]
*  it's just worth reading because there's a lot of weird characters involved it's fun but third of [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=947.4399999999999s)]
*  all I think it does illustrate how a lot of this stuff works um where uh Teaneck New Jersey is a [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=951.92s)]
*  town with a big it has a lot of divides but it has a big generational divide where the adults that [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=957.5999999999999s)]
*  run the town are very staunchly pro-Israel and the kids at the public high school um are not and you [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=963.52s)]
*  know this sort of had existed before there were sort of conflicts about this going back to [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=970.24s)]
*  earlier rounds of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in 2021 for example there was a big [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=976.0s)]
*  controversy in the town but October 7th I think in Teaneck New Jersey and across the world um [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=981.12s)]
*  turbocharged a lot of these pre-existing uh dynamics so you have this big open generational [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=988.16s)]
*  conflict where the adults are suddenly shocked that the kids are just don't agree with their [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=994.8s)]
*  view on things and um at first you have this sort of angry mob reaction by people who are just like [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=999.2s)]
*  you know shut up kids uh which then sort of turns into a more organized uh counter campaign [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=1006.32s)]
*  which then sort of activates these levers of government uh or it activates organizations [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=1013.84s)]
*  that know how to pull the levers of government um and so suddenly you have Gottheimer basically [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=1019.6800000000001s)]
*  pushing the Department of Education to bring in a Title VI investigation that's a [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=1026.56s)]
*  ethnic discrimination against the high school for allowing this protest um and I think yeah [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=1031.04s)]
*  if you sort of ask who is behind it I mean there is an organized pro-Israel movement in the U.S. that [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=1038.96s)]
*  has been organizing for a pretty long time against the possibility of a boycott movement [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=1044.3999999999999s)]
*  and has been learning pretty well like what the different levers of power you can pull are what [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=1050.8799999999999s)]
*  are the sort of anti-discrimination laws and anti-boycott laws and counter-terrorism laws [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=1056.16s)]
*  that you can use to sort of draw guilt by association and it's sort of um you know I'm not [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=1060.64s)]
*  I haven't been the most immersed in this there are other journalists who have covered this a lot [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=1066.8000000000002s)]
*  better than I have but uh I yeah I do think that there is a sort of organized uh campaign and in [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=1070.64s)]
*  some of it does come from people who are in touch with the Israeli government there's a great [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=1078.64s)]
*  documentary uh called The Lobby that was put out by Al Jazeera in uh I think 2018 and Gottheimer [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=1082.56s)]
*  actually was one of the people who tried to get it suppressed uh he personally led a sort of uh [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=1089.12s)]
*  letter along with Lee Zeldin to to shut this to punish Al Jazeera basically um and it demonstrates [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=1094.0s)]
*  you know you have like think tanks and uh political advocacy organizations talking to [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=1101.2s)]
*  you know Israeli government ministries about well you know what is the uh what do you guys [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=1107.6s)]
*  consider threatening let's figure out how we can how we can massage the American political system [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=1114.08s)]
*  and I you say cultural assumptions I think that's a good good way of putting it I think a lot of [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=1119.36s)]
*  Americans assume that sort of like the Israel lobby rules by uh fear or greed or something [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=1123.52s)]
*  and I do think that there is like an element of carrot and stick but a lot of it works because [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=1129.68s)]
*  American politicians of the older generation generally like they like Israel on an emotional [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=1134.64s)]
*  level Joe Biden really believes that the U.S. has a duty to like protect the Jewish state and so [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=1139.76s)]
*  they're willing to hear it and they're willing to sort of do these things and um I think only now [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=1146.48s)]
*  that it's sort of become a crisis and the question has been forced on um Americans of the younger [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=1153.92s)]
*  generation that has become apparent that like a lot of these measures are that they've done in [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=1159.68s)]
*  favor of Israel are both exceptional and not necessarily popular and actually sort of come off [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=1164.16s)]
*  as repressive and heavy-handed I think I don't think the older people see it this way I think [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=1169.92s)]
*  they see it it's like oh well of course we love Israel yeah of course we'll do this yeah I mean [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=1173.92s)]
*  it's interesting like you see public opinion polls over the last three to six months and they show [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=1179.2s)]
*  an absolutely vivid undeniable I don't want to say collapse maybe that's melodramatic but serious [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=1184.3200000000002s)]
*  decline in the amount of support for Israel inside the United States across almost every [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=1190.72s)]
*  demographic group including young Republicans or using young in a very generous way Republicans 50 [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFS1N1SZ2E&t=1196.8s)]
