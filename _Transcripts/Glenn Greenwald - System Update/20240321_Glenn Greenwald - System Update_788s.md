# Unprecedented: Top Trump Aide Sent to Jail for Contempt of Congress
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [March 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA)
*  Peter Navarro is a very close aide of Donald Trump. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=0.0s)]
*  He was somebody who particularly after the 2020 election, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=11.48s)]
*  stood by Trump's side, played a major role in advising [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=15.48s)]
*  Donald Trump about how to navigate the post 2020 election. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  As a result, he was someone who became high up on [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=23.12s)]
*  the public enemies list of the political establishment in Washington. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=27.32s)]
*  He was blamed in a lot of ways as being one of Trump's aides who [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=31.880000000000003s)]
*  encouraged him to persist in his view that the 2020 election was [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=34.84s)]
*  the byproduct of election fraud and as well was somebody who was [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=38.92s)]
*  blamed for agitating and stirring people up in order to add in [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=42.04s)]
*  the in the in a way that led to the riot on January 6 and to [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  the violence on January 6. Now, as a result, Peter Navarro is [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=52.760000000000005s)]
*  somebody who if you're an American liberal, if you're in the American [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=56.76s)]
*  political establishment, you absolutely dislike and that shouldn't matter for [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=59.559999999999995s)]
*  the story that we're about to tell you about, but it absolutely and [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=65.48s)]
*  obviously does, which is that Peter Navarro is on his way to prison, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=68.28s)]
*  prison where he will serve a real sentence in a real prison of four [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=73.56s)]
*  months because he was found guilty to of being in [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=77.96s)]
*  contempt of a congressional subpoena. Oftentimes, Congress orders people to [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=83.55999999999999s)]
*  appear before it to testify about certain [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=88.36s)]
*  matters that Congress wants to know about. The January 6 committee issued a [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=92.6s)]
*  subpoena directing Peter Navarro to appear before it to answer certain [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=97.08s)]
*  questions. Navarro refused to appear arguing that [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=100.44s)]
*  the information that the committee was seeking was [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=104.35999999999999s)]
*  protected by the executive privilege because he was an advisor to President [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=108.52s)]
*  Trump and was speaking to President Trump in that capacity and instead of [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=112.2s)]
*  going there and raising their privilege, he simply didn't show up. The Congress [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=116.04s)]
*  found him in contempt of Congress and he is now on his way to prison. Now, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=118.92s)]
*  you may think that that's not a big deal. It's only a four-month prison term. He [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=124.92s)]
*  actually did ignore a congressional subpoena. The important thing to know is [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=129.72s)]
*  that never in the history of our country has anyone gone to prison for contempt [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=135.0s)]
*  of a congressional subpoena until today when Donald Trump's close political [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=141.72s)]
*  advisor Peter Navarro, obviously hated by the establishment for the reasons I [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=146.28s)]
*  just said, went to prison becoming the first ever [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=149.4s)]
*  person to do so despite the fact that many top officials in Washington, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=152.28s)]
*  including President Obama's Attorney General Eric Holder, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=158.6s)]
*  were also found by Congress to be guilty of contempt of a congressional subpoena [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=162.44s)]
*  by failing to comply and needless to say they never got anywhere near a prison. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=166.68s)]
*  This is something reserved exclusively for Peter Navarro. Here is how CNN [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=171.48s)]
*  decided to frame the story. Ex-Trump aide Peter Navarro began serving prison [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=177.72s)]
*  sentence after historic contempt prosecution and it is [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=182.92s)]
*  historic. Historic because people don't go to [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=188.12s)]
*  prison for defying a congressional subpoena [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=191.72s)]
*  until now and unless you are an advisor to Donald Trump who the [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=195.0s)]
*  establishment blames for his post-2020 election conduct but that can't be how [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=201.79999999999998s)]
*  justice is meted out and yet it is. Quote, Peter Navarro, an ex-White House [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=206.27999999999997s)]
*  aide to former President Donald Trump, has reported to a federal prison in [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=210.51999999999998s)]
*  Miami making history as the first former [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=213.88s)]
*  White House official to be in prison for a contempt of Congress conviction. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=216.92s)]
*  Navarro was sentenced to four months in prison [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=220.76s)]
*  for his refusal to comply with a subpoena from the House Select Committee [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=224.36s)]
*  that investigated the January 6, 2021 U.S. Capitol attack for decades. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=228.52s)]
*  The two branches of government have engaged in the game of chicken [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=232.76000000000002s)]
*  over the protections that surround the presidency and how Congress can enforce [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=236.36s)]
*  his subpoena. There have been incentives on both [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=240.12s)]
*  sides to negotiate toward a deal rather than test in court the monumental [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=242.68s)]
*  questions of executive privilege and immunity in [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=246.28000000000003s)]
*  this case the Justice Department, the Biden [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=249.96s)]
*  Justice Department, took the uncommon step, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=253.64000000000001s)]
*  the unprecedented step, of prosecuting a former White House advisor for blowing [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=256.44s)]
*  off a congressional subpoena at Congress's prompting after holding [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=260.28000000000003s)]
*  Navarro in criminal contempt and referring him to the Department of [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=264.36s)]
*  Justice. Now remember Democrats since 2016 have [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=267.56s)]
*  depicted themselves as the defender and guardians of [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=274.84000000000003s)]
*  American political norms and traditions, the defenders of an [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=278.28s)]
*  apolitical justice system and of a independent Department of [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=284.76s)]
*  Justice and yet over and over what we see [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=289.64s)]
*  is the application of novel legal theories to punish Donald Trump's [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=292.76s)]
*  followers has happened all throughout January 6 and those [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=296.44s)]
*  prosecutions when they found ways to convert [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=299.32s)]
*  non-violent political protests which according to the government was true for [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=303.64s)]
*  the vast majority of people prosecuting in connection with January 6 that they [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=307.8s)]
*  did not use violence they found a way to convert that into a [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=310.76s)]
*  felony using never before highly innovative precedents [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=313.64s)]
*  and interpretations of law that are now actually [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=320.84000000000003s)]
*  starting to be weakened by courts the more they look at them [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=324.12s)]
*  but obviously it extends as well to the fact that Donald Trump [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=328.76s)]
*  if the Democrats get their way will be the first ever American president [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=332.04s)]
*  to see the inside of a jail cell they tried to strike him from the ballot this [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=335.48s)]
*  is all what is called lawfare the abuse of [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=339.96000000000004s)]
*  the legal system of the judicial system to [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=344.68s)]
*  punish people for political ends now here from the hill in [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=347.88s)]
*  June of 2022 was an article by Jonathan Turley called subpoena wars Washington [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=355.24s)]
*  is on a path to mutually assured destruction [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=360.12s)]
*  and here is Jonathan Turley's argument that he made in 2022 about all this quote [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=363.8s)]
*  attorney general Merrick Garland is well on his way to setting a record [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=369.72s)]
*  for the prosecution of congressional contempt the justice department has [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=373.32s)]
*  consistently refused to submit congressional contempt cases [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=376.44s)]
*  to grand juries including a flagrant act of contempt by Obama-era attorney [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=380.28000000000003s)]
*  general Eric Holder there is ample basis for this charge [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=384.12s)]
*  as well it is not the substance but the selectivity and speed of the charges [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=388.28000000000003s)]
*  that is notable Navarro was only held in contempt in [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=391.96s)]
*  April and is now being prosecuted by a department long known as the place where [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=395.4s)]
*  contempt sanctions go to die [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=399.23999999999995s)]
*  now there are important reasons why it is highly unusual in fact unprecedented [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=403.88s)]
*  for officials of the executive branch who work for the president [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=410.91999999999996s)]
*  not to be put into prison for defying congressional subpoenas there are [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=414.91999999999996s)]
*  obvious issues of checks and balances and the [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=418.68s)]
*  always ongoing quest for power between the various branches of government [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=423.48s)]
*  if you're an ordinary citizen and you defy a congressional subpoena then you [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=431.24s)]
*  very well may end up in prison that has happened before people who lie to [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=434.36s)]
*  congress people who defy congress might end up in prison but when you [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=438.2s)]
*  have members of the executive branch you are [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=443.16s)]
*  being told by members of congress that they're forced to do something or go to [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=445.32s)]
*  prison that creates all kinds of separation of power issues about what the [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=449.88s)]
*  ability of congress is to force members of the executive branch [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=455.0s)]
*  an article one body in congress telling an article two body the executive branch [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=459.48s)]
*  that they have to comply with congressional subpoenas or go to [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=463.64s)]
*  prisons that's why in washington the norm has always been [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=466.28s)]
*  that even if a member of the executive branch [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=470.76s)]
*  refuses or fails to comply with the congressional subpoena they do not go to [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=473.72s)]
*  prison because the justice department never [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=477.56s)]
*  wanted to test this all of this is brand new it's newly [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=479.96000000000004s)]
*  minted for donald trump and his advisors yet again [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=483.24s)]
*  if there had been a history of executive branch officials who are found to be in [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=488.36s)]
*  contempt of congress going to prison and then peter navarro was sent to prison [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=492.20000000000005s)]
*  in accordance with that precedent i would have nothing to say about this case [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=496.44000000000005s)]
*  but it's the fact that as always there's a complete deviation from [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=500.68s)]
*  principles and tradition and precedent to politicize the justice system to warp [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=505.96s)]
*  and weaponize it in service of the attempt by the washington [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=511.08s)]
*  establishment including members of both political parties [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvVmVJUXhA&t=516.92s)]
