# Prof. John Mearsheimer Condemns Trump Admin Speech Crackdowns
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [April 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM)
*  You mentioned earlier this kind of massive attack by the Trump administration on colleges [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=0.0s)]
*  and universities. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=11.72s)]
*  You obviously care a great deal about academia. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=13.3s)]
*  You work in academia. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=16.02s)]
*  You have pretty much your adult life. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  It's something that I know you value. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  You've spent a lot of time here before talking about your ardent belief in free speech and [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=21.32s)]
*  how the attacks on protest are eroding it on campus. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=27.04s)]
*  But now we have something in a different universe than what we saw in 2024. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=32.08s)]
*  Not only these deportations of law-abiding legal immigrants in the United States for [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=36.6s)]
*  the crime of criticizing or protesting Israel, but also demands now that colleges and universities [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=43.36s)]
*  adopt this radically expansive definition of hate speech and anti-Semitism to include [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=51.96s)]
*  all sorts of criticisms of Israel, including now outlawing something you said earlier, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=57.120000000000005s)]
*  which was comparing and contrasting Israeli actions with the acts of the Nazis. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=62.44s)]
*  That is something that wherever this expanded definition of anti-Semitism is adopted, would [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=67.52s)]
*  essentially get you expelled if you're a student, potentially fired if you're an academic. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=73.04s)]
*  But then on top of that, you have this whole kind of climate where speakers are being [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=79.36s)]
*  disinvited if they're going to talk about Gaza. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=85.92s)]
*  You have Middle East studies programs at Columbia being put under receivership at the demands [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=88.88s)]
*  of the Trump administration. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=93.96s)]
*  At Harvard, you have the Middle East studies director and associate director forced out [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=95.44s)]
*  because they're not pro-Israel enough. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=99.36s)]
*  What do you make of all of this in terms of the future of free speech and academic freedom [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=102.24s)]
*  in America's academia? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=108.44s)]
*  Well, it's a disaster. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=109.44s)]
*  There's just no question about it. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=112.44s)]
*  Not only is free speech being attacked here, but I think that the Trump administration [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=117.28s)]
*  is bent on badly damaging universities. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=126.44s)]
*  It's bent on wrecking them. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=131.8s)]
*  When you come into a university from the outside, the way the administration is doing, and you [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=135.4s)]
*  dictate how that university is run in all sorts of ways that are completely antithetical [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=140.56s)]
*  to the way our great universities have been run for a long, long time, you are threatening [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=146.95999999999998s)]
*  the existence of some of the most important institutions, not only in the United States, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=153.24s)]
*  but on the planet. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=158.24s)]
*  I have a number of friends who are not Americans, who come from foreign countries, who can't [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=159.24s)]
*  believe what we're doing because they think that American universities are the most wonderful [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=165.07999999999998s)]
*  institutions in the world. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=171.28s)]
*  This is not to say that our universities don't have problems. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=173.07999999999998s)]
*  They do have problems, and those problems need to be addressed. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=176.16s)]
*  But nevertheless, to bring a wrecking ball in and take places like Harvard and Columbia [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=179.72s)]
*  and Princeton and Penn, and now they've added Brown to the list and take the wrecking ball [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=186.07999999999998s)]
*  to them, in my mind is really just crazy. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=190.56s)]
*  Why would anybody do this? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=197.07999999999998s)]
*  But again, as I said to you before, Glenn, you do not want to underestimate how radical [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=198.83999999999997s)]
*  Trump is. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=203.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=204.48s)]
*  Well, just to make the argument that I hear often from Trump supporters and defenders of [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=205.48s)]
*  all this, which is universities used to be an epicenter of innovation and research and [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=208.72s)]
*  produce cures, created the internet. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=216.2s)]
*  Mark Andreessen, a prominent Trump supporter who obviously was instrumental in the creation [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=219.2s)]
*  of the internet with Netscape, told the New York Times that it was basically Al Gore, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=223.52s)]
*  despite all the mockery he got, who really did lead the way in getting funding for key [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=227.76s)]
*  institutions to do the research that ultimately led to browsers and to the internet. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=232.04s)]
*  That's been the history of America academia. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=237.16s)]
*  The argument now is, look, now they're just hotbeds of left-wing ideology and gender studies [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=239.2s)]
*  and sociology. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=244.56s)]
*  Beyond that, they can do whatever they want, but not if they're getting federal funding. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=246.56s)]
*  If they're getting federal funding, they have to align themselves with the ideology of the [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=250.64000000000001s)]
*  federal government or they don't have to get federal funding and they can do what they [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=254.4s)]
*  want. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=258.16s)]
*  What do you make of those? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=259.16s)]
*  Look, I think there's no question that the political center of gravity in universities [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=260.16s)]
*  is too far to the left and needs to be pushed back towards the center. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=265.66s)]
*  It's not as dire a situation by any means as critics on the right make out. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=272.24s)]
*  I would come at this whole issue from a different perspective. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=279.0s)]
*  I wouldn't focus simply on the inventions that come out of universities. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=282.40000000000003s)]
*  I would focus on the phenomenon of critical thinking. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=286.96000000000004s)]
*  What universities do is they teach young people to think critically. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=290.40000000000003s)]
*  Young people have not figured out by the time they graduate from high school how to think [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=295.72s)]
*  critically, how to read a book and pick it apart and figure out what the author's argument [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=303.88000000000005s)]
*  is, and how to counter that argument. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=309.36s)]
*  What universities are really good at is teaching young people, whether you're in the hard sciences, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=313.8s)]
*  humanities or in the social sciences, to think critically. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=320.6s)]
*  Free speech, of course, is inextricably bound up with critical thinking. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=327.96000000000004s)]
*  You want people to be free to ask any questions that pop into their mind. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=332.6s)]
*  You want them to be free to make arguments that disagree with arguments that you, the [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=337.32000000000005s)]
*  professor, are making. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=342.04s)]
*  This is what the enterprise is all about. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=343.08000000000004s)]
*  It's what makes it such a wonderful enterprise. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=346.12s)]
*  It's why people from all around the world are so interested in coming to universities. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=348.34s)]
*  What the Trump administration is doing, and of course the Israel lobby is playing a key [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=355.06s)]
*  role here, is undermining this process by undermining critical thinking, by making it [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=359.14s)]
*  possible to stake your views on particular issues for fear that you'll be thrown in jail [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=366.02s)]
*  or you'll be dismissed from the position that you're in. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=373.14s)]
*  This is really a huge mistake on the part of the Trump administration, and it is a huge [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=376.66s)]
*  mistake on the part of the Israel lobby. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=382.98s)]
*  They should absolutely not be doing this. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=385.34000000000003s)]
*  It is not in the interest of Israel's supporters to pursue these kind of policies on university [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=388.08000000000004s)]
*  and college campuses. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=395.18s)]
*  I still remember the excitement I felt when I got to college and started exploring things [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=397.18s)]
*  and getting exposed to ideas that I had never previously known had existed. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=402.18s)]
*  Not only that, but being encouraged, not just allowed, but encouraged to question every [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=406.74s)]
*  piety, every orthodoxy. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=411.66s)]
*  I got in a lot of debates with professors who had been studying these issues for a long [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=413.02s)]
*  time and they encouraged that. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=417.1s)]
*  You challenge them and you have these exchange of ideas. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=418.54s)]
*  What amazes me about it is you have all these people who talk about preserving our nation [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=421.62s)]
*  and its founding values. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=427.5s)]
*  You go back to the Enlightenment, which is essentially what gave birth to the American [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=430.3s)]
*  founding, the Enlightenment ideals and values. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=433.94s)]
*  There was all this kind of not just discussion about the supreme importance of free speech [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=438.38s)]
*  and free discourse, but also having a place where all taboos and all pieties get picked [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=443.58000000000004s)]
*  at in question, which was, is academia? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=449.42s)]
*  This has been central to the American founding and the American way of life for centuries. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=451.88s)]
*  It's amazing to me to watch people who say that they are devoted to preserving the American [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=456.34s)]
*  life and the American values to be so supportive of this full frontal attack on this, all for [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=463.17999999999995s)]
*  the benefit of a foreign country. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=469.38s)]
*  I agree with you. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=473.05999999999995s)]
*  Just to come in from another perspective, Glenn, the fact is that we live in a remarkably [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=474.26s)]
*  complicated world and it's hard to figure out what's going on. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=479.34s)]
*  As you pointed out at the top of the show, it's hard to keep up with the news because [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=485.34s)]
*  there's a new issue every day on a new subject. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=490.58s)]
*  We collectively are having lots of trouble just trying to make sense of the world that [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=499.12s)]
*  we operate in. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=503.94s)]
*  What I think we do at universities is we teach critical thinking, which is what allows students [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=505.78s)]
*  who then become adults, young adults and older adults, we teach them to think critically [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=512.5s)]
*  about the world. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=521.5s)]
*  We teach them how to try to make sense of the world so that they can navigate the world. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=522.66s)]
*  Make them better citizens. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=529.2199999999999s)]
*  I think this is just a very important function that we serve. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=531.74s)]
*  I think it again just is foolish in the extreme for the Trump administration and the Israel [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=536.18s)]
*  lobby to take the wrecking ball to that enterprise. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqLuyAzsZjM&t=542.7399999999999s)]
