# Pro-Israel Commentators Escalate DERANGED Rhetoric
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [April 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo)
*  Here's something I mentioned and alluded to before, which is a really unbelievable statement. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=0.0s)]
*  It comes from former Senator Norm Coleman, who represented Minnesota. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=14.76s)]
*  He was one of those kind of very moderate Republicans. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=19.12s)]
*  He's Jewish and a very steadfast supporter of Israel. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=24.9s)]
*  He was giving a speech at the JNS event for Jews. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=30.299999999999997s)]
*  He was addressing the fact that in the United States, public opinion is turning against [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=37.1s)]
*  Israel. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=41.18s)]
*  Here was his solution to that. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=42.18s)]
*  The people of Gen Z have an unfavorable impression of Israel. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=45.42s)]
*  My friends, I think the reason for that is that we're losing the digital war. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=50.06s)]
*  They're getting their information from TikTok and whatever it is. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=54.38s)]
*  We're losing that war. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=58.980000000000004s)]
*  When you think about it, the masters of the universe are Jews. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=59.980000000000004s)]
*  We've got Oldman and AI, we've got Zuckerberg. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=64.42s)]
*  I just want to know a couple things before I show you the rest. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=67.9s)]
*  He's saying there that first of all, there's these places where people who are young Americans [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=73.22s)]
*  Gen Z are getting this information that's turning them against Israel. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=81.02s)]
*  The example he led with was TikTok. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=84.14s)]
*  As we've shown you many times before, the reason the TikTok ban finally got enacted [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=88.02s)]
*  after lingering in Washington for years was not because of fear of China, but because [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=92.61999999999999s)]
*  of people becoming convinced in the Congress that there was too much Israel criticism, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=96.34s)]
*  too much pro-Palestinian sentiment circulating on TikTok. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=102.1s)]
*  It was turning young Americans against Israel and they couldn't allow that. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=106.38s)]
*  That's why they voted to ban it. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=109.54s)]
*  Now just by the way, the deadline for banning TikTok has come and gone 90 days ago, more [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=112.58000000000001s)]
*  than 90 days ago. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=120.82000000000001s)]
*  Trump is pretty much ignoring it and just saying, at some point we'll do a sale in order [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=123.02000000000001s)]
*  to keep TikTok going. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=130.14000000000001s)]
*  You barely hear anyone complaining about that. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=132.62s)]
*  So he's saying TikTok is where a lot of the sentiment came from and we had to do something [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=135.46s)]
*  about that and that's where the TikTok ban came from. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=141.70000000000002s)]
*  Imagine banning an app in the United States that a third of the country voluntarily chooses [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=146.3s)]
*  to use, tens of millions of people, because there's too much criticism of foreign country [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=149.94s)]
*  allowed on it. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=155.02s)]
*  But that's what the US government did. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=156.5s)]
*  But he's also saying, and when I first heard it, I thought he was being ironic or sarcastic [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=161.02s)]
*  or satirical, like mocking what an anti-Semite would say, but no he's not, you're going to [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=165.34s)]
*  see, but you just saw this in the clip. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=169.38s)]
*  I'm going to play it again. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=171.3s)]
*  He's saying, look the solution is obvious. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=172.82s)]
*  The masters of the universe are Jews. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=177.38s)]
*  We Jews have the masters of the universe on our side. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=179.74s)]
*  They're part of us. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=183.18s)]
*  It goes on to list a bunch of examples like Mark Zuckerberg, you're going to hear that. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=185.62s)]
*  Could you imagine if anybody who was critical of Israel said that? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=191.42000000000002s)]
*  Oh look, all the masters of the universe are Jewish. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=195.06s)]
*  You would be destroyed as an anti-Semite in a minute. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=198.58s)]
*  But you can say the same exact thing as long as you're saying it in support of Israel and [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=202.86s)]
*  nobody blinks an eye. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=207.66s)]
*  Here's what he said. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=208.66s)]
*  And whatever it is, and we're losing that war. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=210.66s)]
*  When you think about it, the masters of the universe are Jews. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=213.66s)]
*  We've got Oldman and AI, we've got Zuckerberg, we've got Sergey Brin, we've got the whole [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=218.1s)]
*  group across the board, Jan Combs, you know, head of what's founded WhatsApp. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=223.06s)]
*  It's us. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=227.42s)]
*  And we have to figure out a way to win the digital battle. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=228.7s)]
*  Amelia, we got to get our digital sneakers on so that the truth can prevail over the [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=232.57999999999998s)]
*  lies. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=237.7s)]
*  And when we do that, the future of Israel will be stronger because a majority of all [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=238.5s)]
*  Americans will support Israel. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=243.5s)]
*  We'll make that happen. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=245.06s)]
*  We have to make it happen. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=246.26s)]
*  Thank you, Varkat. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=247.29999999999998s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=248.57999999999998s)]
*  I just want you to reflect on how unbelievable that really is. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=249.1s)]
*  He's saying, hey, look, I have a list of Jews who are the masters of the universe. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=256.1s)]
*  They control everything. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=260.21999999999997s)]
*  They can control public opinion. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=261.21999999999997s)]
*  Sam Altman at OpenAI and Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook and Sergey Brin at Google and the [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=263.42s)]
*  founder of WhatsApp. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=274.34s)]
*  And then he says, we have them. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=276.74s)]
*  We the Jews have them. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=278.9s)]
*  They're us. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=280.5s)]
*  So he's like speaking about Jews as like a kind of separate from the population people, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=281.5s)]
*  which again is like a very anti-Semitic trope to be promoting. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=287.97999999999996s)]
*  He's not saying we Americans or we Israelis. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=290.58s)]
*  He's saying we the Jews, we have these people. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=293.53999999999996s)]
*  The masters of the universe are us, are Jews. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=296.46s)]
*  And he's saying the thing that we need to do to combat declining support for Israel among [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=300.46s)]
*  American citizens is use the power we have over the internet, the control we have over [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=307.34s)]
*  the biggest platforms to disseminate propaganda and change the minds of Americans back to [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=313.09999999999997s)]
*  supporting Israel. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=321.09999999999997s)]
*  And the reason he says we can do it is because all the masters of the universe are Jews and [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=322.94s)]
*  it's time for them to do what they should be doing as Jews, which is not offering a [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=325.9s)]
*  platform for American citizens to speak freely or to receive information freely, but no, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=333.04s)]
*  to use it to bolster and disseminate and promote support for Israel so that Americans once [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=338.72s)]
*  again learn to love Israel. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=347.08000000000004s)]
*  And he's such a naked, blatant way of seeing the world. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=348.84000000000003s)]
*  People do see this world this way, believe me. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=355.96000000000004s)]
*  They just don't usually say such a thing in public. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=359.28s)]
*  And especially for someone whose life has been in politics and they're just kind of [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=363.67999999999995s)]
*  naturally trained to understand the goalposts that you cannot transgress, the limits that [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=369.2s)]
*  you cannot transgress, for him to say something like this, I think again shows the desperation. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=374.67999999999995s)]
*  Because ultimately that is the biggest fear of Israel, to lose political support inside [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=382.15999999999997s)]
*  the United States for paying for their country. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=385.88s)]
*  And that's where a lot of this desperation is coming from. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=389.2s)]
*  Now speaking of desperate, a Harvard professor named Ruth Weiss or Wissy, Wiss, wrote an [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=391.15999999999997s)]
*  article in the Wall Street Journal, not bad, the title of which is Harvard is an Islamist [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=399.08s)]
*  outpost. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=406.64s)]
*  For decades it nurtured resentful leftists and anti-Semitism united them in a common [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=408.64s)]
*  cause. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=414.52s)]
*  The idea of Harvard being an Islamist outpost, the long time home of Alan Dershowitz as one [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=417.72s)]
*  of its most celebrated and famous faculty members, I think it's something like six of [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=423.92s)]
*  the last seven or five of the last seven, six of the last eight presidents of Harvard [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=431.64000000000004s)]
*  have been Jewish, including the current one, Alan Gerber. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=438.48s)]
*  They had a non-Jewish president for about seven seconds, and Elise Stefanik and the [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=443.6s)]
*  Republicans forced her out because of her refusal to say we're going to ban phrases [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=449.32s)]
*  like from the river to the sea is genocidal, we have to look at the context to see if it's [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=457.08s)]
*  genocidal. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=460.52s)]
*  They got rid of two other, three other Ivy League presidents as well over the same issue, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=463.52s)]
*  one at the University of Penn, two at the University of Columbia. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=469.2s)]
*  I just want to show you who this person is, Ruth Wisse, who is writing this op-ed in the [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=474.2s)]
*  Wall Street Journal saying Harvard is an outpost of Islamism because I think it's very valuable [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=479.52s)]
*  to really listen to these people when they're at the most candid. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=484.28s)]
*  Ruth Wisse is a, she's a very distinguished professor of Yiddish at Harvard, but she's [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=487.44s)]
*  also one of the old school neocons, very vocal in support of everything Bush and Cheney [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=497.2s)]
*  did as part of the war on terror, invading Iraq. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=503.24s)]
*  She wanted to invade Iran, she wants a war with Iran. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=505.71999999999997s)]
*  So everything to her looks like an Islamist outpost. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=510.48s)]
*  Any criticism of Israel becomes anti-Semitic or Islamist, this is her worldview. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=512.96s)]
*  And I just want to have you hear her worldview in her own words where she's explaining to [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=518.2s)]
*  American Jews like herself what their duty is by explaining to them using the voice of [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=526.32s)]
*  an Israeli Jew what Israeli Jews are saying to American Jews and what American Jews should [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=531.2800000000001s)]
*  hear. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=538.2800000000001s)]
*  Here's what she said. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=539.2800000000001s)]
*  Us look good. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=540.2800000000001s)]
*  Our job is not to make you look good, American Jews. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=543.2s)]
*  What do you have to worry about? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=546.72s)]
*  Your job is to make us look good. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=548.6s)]
*  And here's how you do it. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=551.02s)]
*  Every one of us has to serve three years in the Army, two years in the Army, some of us [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=552.72s)]
*  five years and then for the rest of our lives. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=557.1600000000001s)]
*  You have got to serve two or three years in the Army of words. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=560.02s)]
*  You've got to learn to fight the political battle, which is even more important at this [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=564.4s)]
*  point than the military battle that we are. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=569.0s)]
*  We'll fight the military battle. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=572.0s)]
*  We're not asking you necessarily to come and be lone soldiers, although some of you [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=573.52s)]
*  can. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=577.76s)]
*  You've got to learn how to fight back on the campuses, how to make the arguments. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=578.76s)]
*  Now they keep shifting. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=584.08s)]
*  I mean, that's her view of the duty of an American Jew to enlist in the Army of words [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=586.52s)]
*  in loyalty and defense of a foreign country, Israel. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=594.4399999999999s)]
*  And she's even saying like, hey, some of you can actually come and fight for the Israeli [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=602.28s)]
*  Army. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=607.76s)]
*  And there are a lot of Americans who do. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=608.76s)]
*  A lot of American Jews go to fight in the Israeli Army. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=609.76s)]
*  The quote unquote American hostage that's in Hamas is actually somebody who is an Israeli [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=612.2s)]
*  citizen as well, went to Israel, enlisted in the IDF, was in active duty combat the [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=619.96s)]
*  day that Hamas took him. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=627.8000000000001s)]
*  Now if American citizens go to fight for a foreign army, it suddenly becomes our war. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=632.84s)]
*  If Americans go to fight in Ukraine and they get captured by the Russians, now it's suddenly [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=638.24s)]
*  our responsibility because they decided to go and fight for a foreign army. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=644.0s)]
*  Obviously, that would never be the standard for any country other than Israel. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=648.0400000000001s)]
*  I want to show you this as well. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=652.08s)]
*  This is from March of last year. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=655.64s)]
*  Unlike the clip we showed you before, which is from 2019, here's the same person, the [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=657.4000000000001s)]
*  same Harvard professor, Ruth Wisse, who has this article in the Wall Street Journal saying [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=662.04s)]
*  Harvard is an outpost of Islamism. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=667.12s)]
*  And this is what she believes is also the duty of Jews. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=672.88s)]
*  I just want you to listen to this. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=677.6s)]
*  The way the, I mean, again, this is an American Jew. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=678.92s)]
*  I think she's Canadian actually. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=682.28s)]
*  But like Norm Coleman, who we just showed you, she conceives of Jews as a kind of separate [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=686.04s)]
*  people, people with duties and obligations apart from their citizenship of a foreign [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=691.92s)]
*  country, which is one of the worst and most destructive anti-Semitic tropes ever. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=696.1999999999999s)]
*  That's what Hitler wrote about Jews in Mein Kampf. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=699.8399999999999s)]
*  It doesn't matter where Jews go, what citizens of what countries they become, they're always [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=704.0s)]
*  going to have supreme loyalty to Jews and not to their country. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=708.28s)]
*  People thought that about Catholics as well. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=712.04s)]
*  And JFK ran as a Catholic. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=715.7199999999999s)]
*  There was a lot of claims that he was going to be loyal to the Vatican and to the Pope [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=718.8399999999999s)]
*  and not to America. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=722.9599999999999s)]
*  And there were previous Catholic candidates who were sunk by those suspicions as well. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=724.9599999999999s)]
*  And that's why it's so amazing to hear Norm Coleman stand up and say, hey, we have, like [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=732.3199999999999s)]
*  we are Jews as a separate people. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=738.92s)]
*  We have all these masters of the universe. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=741.28s)]
*  So we can use them there for our agenda. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=743.2s)]
*  Here's Ruth Wisse talking about how she sees Jews globally. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=748.2s)]
*  If you are an Israeli anywhere, and if you are a Jew anywhere, a Jew anywhere, Mr. Netanyahu [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=752.5200000000001s)]
*  is the head of the Israeli government and you stand up and salute and you ask everyone [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=761.48s)]
*  else in the whole world, don't you dare. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=768.8s)]
*  Again, I can't believe it. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=772.4s)]
*  What I can't believe is not that they think this. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=777.64s)]
*  I know they think this. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=779.1999999999999s)]
*  What I can't believe is that they're at the point where they're kind of so desperate that [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=781.92s)]
*  they're willing to say it publicly. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=784.8399999999999s)]
*  She said, if you are a Jew anywhere, not just in Israel, but anywhere, so you're an American [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=788.3599999999999s)]
*  Jew. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=794.68s)]
*  Netanyahu is your leader. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=795.68s)]
*  And so when he enters the room, you stand up and you salute him. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=799.3599999999999s)]
*  The duty of an American Jew, an American citizen who's Jewish is to stand up and salute the [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=804.7199999999999s)]
*  leader of a foreign government. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=812.92s)]
*  We don't even stand up and salute our own leaders. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=814.16s)]
*  Why would we stand up and salute as an American citizen, the leader of a foreign country? [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=816.56s)]
*  Unless you believe, as she's saying, that the real duty of Jews, the real loyalty of [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=823.28s)]
*  Jews is not to their country of citizenship, but to Israel. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=826.6s)]
*  That's insane. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=830.9599999999999s)]
*  It's insane to go around saying that. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=832.12s)]
*  That is what anti-Semites believe about Jews and these people are saying that openly. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=836.8s)]
*  Here, let me just play that part again because I just kind of can't believe it. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=841.48s)]
*  And if you are a Jew anywhere, a Jew anywhere, Mr. Netanyahu is the head of the Israeli government [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=848.64s)]
*  and you stand up and salute and you ask everyone else in the whole world, don't you dare minimize [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=858.24s)]
*  our prime minister? [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=867.64s)]
*  Don't you dare call him a chickenshit. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=869.12s)]
*  I don't know who called Netanyahu a chickenshit. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=872.16s)]
*  I personally wouldn't call him that. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=876.28s)]
*  He actually did fight in wars for Israel. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=877.92s)]
*  I'd call him a lot of other things. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=882.16s)]
*  I don't know who called that, but I don't know which. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=883.16s)]
*  You can call him that if you want. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=885.36s)]
*  But the idea that American Jews have to stand up and salute Netanyahu, I mean, this is the [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=887.76s)]
*  kind of thing that anti-Semites would say. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=893.64s)]
*  Verbatim. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=897.3199999999999s)]
*  These people are so desperate now that they are trying to impose this framework. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=899.5999999999999s)]
*  You know, like, hey, the heads of all these American social media companies, they're us. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=905.24s)]
*  They're Jews. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=909.92s)]
*  They're the masters of the universe. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=910.92s)]
*  It's time for them to start using their power to manipulate discourse and public opinion [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=911.92s)]
*  to turn Americans into lovers of Israel again. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=916.04s)]
*  Hey, they're not saying that in private. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=919.08s)]
*  They're saying that openly. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXkkq8-_UDo&t=921.36s)]
