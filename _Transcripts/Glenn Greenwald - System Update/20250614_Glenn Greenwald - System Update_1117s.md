# Iranians are "Outraged": Iranian-American Professor on Tehran Attack Aftermath
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [June 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w)
*  Professor Mohammed Marandi is an Iranian-American academic and political analyst. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=0.0s)]
*  He is based in Tehran, where he is located right at this very moment, and is the head [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=11.88s)]
*  of the National American Studies Program at the University of Tehran, where he now teaches [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=16.46s)]
*  English literature and Orientalism. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=20.96s)]
*  He has become one of the leading voices inside Iran to give a perspective that is crucially [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=22.84s)]
*  different than the kind of echo chamber we hear from the Washington think tank community, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=30.6s)]
*  and he is generally regarded as a supporter of the country's general foreign policy orientation [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=35.0s)]
*  and political interests, which is why he brings a very valuable perspective, usually deliberately [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=40.96s)]
*  suppressed and unheard in Western media. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  What we believe, as we've said before, that especially when war breaks out, it's more [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=49.6s)]
*  vital than ever to hear exactly from people inside those countries we're not supposed [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=53.04s)]
*  to hear from or we're supposed to consider our enemy. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=57.84s)]
*  He has been on our show before. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=60.6s)]
*  We've followed his work for a long time, and we are very happy to have you be able to hear [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=61.68s)]
*  what he has to say. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=66.24000000000001s)]
*  Professor Marandi, thank you so much for taking the time to join us tonight. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=67.88s)]
*  I know that you have a lot going on. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=74.16s)]
*  We had you on our show, I think, about a month ago to talk about the prospect of an Israeli [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=77.03999999999999s)]
*  strike on Iran, which has now happened. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=80.16s)]
*  Before we get to the geopolitical implications and the like, you were in Tehran. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=83.27999999999999s)]
*  What is it that you can tell us that you heard, that you saw, what is happening in that city [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=87.36s)]
*  over the past, say, 12 to 16 hours since this attack began? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=92.08s)]
*  Well, the attack began early in the morning, and people were asleep for the most part. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=96.67999999999999s)]
*  People by chance happened to be awake. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=104.28s)]
*  There were sounds of very loud explosions, and it turned out that some of these explosions [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=109.2s)]
*  were in our neighborhood or close to our neighborhood, and they targeted apartment blocks, apartment [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=115.96000000000001s)]
*  buildings. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=122.6s)]
*  They destroyed one apartment building with 10 units, and children were thrown out of [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=124.56s)]
*  the windows and onto the streets. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=134.44s)]
*  Women were murdered. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=137.44s)]
*  Neighbors of targets were killed. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=138.8s)]
*  Family members of targets were killed. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=140.84s)]
*  It was stunning, and people here are outraged. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=143.52s)]
*  And then, of course, the fighting, people heard the news about the fighting and about [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=149.48s)]
*  the airstrikes being carried out across the country, and we are where we are right now. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=156.16s)]
*  Commanders were murdered in the eyes of Iranians, their martyrs, and they've been quickly replaced, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=162.39999999999998s)]
*  and they're regrouping. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=170.88s)]
*  We expect that the Iranian retaliation would begin possibly in the coming hours. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=172.01999999999998s)]
*  I want to get to that retaliation in a second, but before I do, one of the theories that [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=179.52s)]
*  I have heard for the last several weeks is that this whole notion that there's some kind [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=185.96s)]
*  of rift between Netanyahu and Trump is theater, that it's artificial, that it's not real, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=190.44s)]
*  that the purpose of that, as well as Trump's optimistic claims about the progress of negotiations [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=197.52s)]
*  with Iran, was all kind of a ruse to lure the Iranians into a false sense of security, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=204.64000000000001s)]
*  not really being on high alert. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=211.24s)]
*  Is that something you believe? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=214.04s)]
*  And if so, either way, did it work? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=215.76s)]
*  Was Iran taken a little bit by surprise by this attack? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=218.16s)]
*  I don't think many people believe that there's any divide between the United States and the [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=224.68s)]
*  Israeli regime. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=231.2s)]
*  They're close partners. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=233.36s)]
*  Regardless of what Trump personally thinks about Netanyahu, that's something different [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=234.56s)]
*  and open to speculation, but I don't think that will have any real impact onâ€”and I [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=240.44000000000003s)]
*  don't think people here think there's any real impact on the relationship, the strategic [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=246.16000000000003s)]
*  relationship between the regime and Tel Aviv and Washington. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=250.08s)]
*  As far as I know, the Iranians were prepared for an attack. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=256.6s)]
*  They were waiting for an attack. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=259.56s)]
*  I think, and I'm speculating to be very clear, I think they did not expect this, or at least [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=262.0s)]
*  to senior officials, whether military or civilian. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=269.59999999999997s)]
*  I think the expectation was that they would strike military targets or possibly the nuclear [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=274.76s)]
*  program, but not go so far. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=279.76s)]
*  That is why I think that we had these assassinations succeed. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=282.36s)]
*  But we have to remember that the Iranians are very much alone. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=289.96s)]
*  This is NATO behind Israel, countries across China. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=296.35999999999996s)]
*  They're with NATO. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=301.64s)]
*  They're either members of state or they're allied to the United States. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=302.64s)]
*  So right now, the U.S. bases in Turkey and the Emirates and Qatar and Bahrain, they're [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=306.44s)]
*  all being used to help the Israeli regime, whether for defensive purposes or off-the-shelf. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=315.35999999999996s)]
*  Offensive purposes. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=319.88s)]
*  And their space to Jordan and Syria is open to the regime and the Americans. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=322.04s)]
*  So it's very difficult for Iran to fight such a battle. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=327.8s)]
*  But Glenn, the fact is that this is all about Palestine. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=332.8s)]
*  It has nothing to do really with the Iranian nuclear program. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=335.6s)]
*  If Iran had a policy towards the Palestinian issue like Turkey or the Emirates or Saudi [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=339.71999999999997s)]
*  Arabia or Egypt, the United States would have nothing to do with Iran. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=348.12s)]
*  But the problem is that Iran refuses to accept an ethno-supremacist regime in Palestine, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=352.68s)]
*  and Iran continues to support the Palestinian cause. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=359.64s)]
*  And that is something that is completely unacceptable to the United States. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=362.68s)]
*  And of course, Iran's independent foreign policy in general, which came about after [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=366.12s)]
*  the revolution, where decisions in Iran are made in Tehran. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=371.32s)]
*  There are other reasons, too, the revolution itself and the role that the United States [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=375.36s)]
*  played with the Shah and the embassy takeover and all that. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=381.88s)]
*  But I think it's clear that the divide between Iran and the United States has to do more [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=385.15999999999997s)]
*  about the Israeli regime and what it's doing to the Palestinian people than anything else. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=391.08s)]
*  And therefore, whether there is a nuclear agreement or not, I don't think that the United [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=398.36s)]
*  States is going to ever accept Iran. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=403.48s)]
*  And also under Trump, under Obama, the nuclear deal was constantly violated. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=405.48s)]
*  Trump tore up the deal. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=412.68s)]
*  The Europeans ignored the deal. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=414.12s)]
*  And it was only Iran that was abiding by its commitments. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=417.32s)]
*  And now with Trump in power, as he's constantly flip-flopping and changing his position, even [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=420.12s)]
*  on one day, talking about accepting Iranian enrichment at lower percentages. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=427.23999999999995s)]
*  And then he shifted his position completely with all these shifts taking place in the [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=433.71999999999997s)]
*  White House, whether with regards to the ceasefire in Gaza or the trade war or Iran or Ukraine [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=439.4s)]
*  or elsewhere. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=445.84s)]
*  It's really impossible to have a deal with the United States. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=447.96s)]
*  And even if we do have a deal, who's to say that Trump won't wake up the next morning [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=450.23999999999995s)]
*  and post something on Truth Social saying, I don't accept this deal, the Iranians did [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=454.64s)]
*  the deal or they cheated me or they did this. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=459.44s)]
*  And then the Europeans would say, yes, whatever you say, we follow the leader. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=462.28000000000003s)]
*  We already see that the Israelis, after they attacked Iran, the Europeans are condemning [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=466.56s)]
*  Iran. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=472.6s)]
*  The French are saying Israel has the right to defend itself. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=473.88s)]
*  The Germans are accusing Iran of attacking the Israeli regime, whereas Iran hasn't even [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=477.08s)]
*  Iran hasn't done anything yet. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=483.56s)]
*  Oh, those drones that they talk about, there were no drones fired from Iran. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=485.04s)]
*  But in any case, the regime initiated this. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=489.2s)]
*  The Israeli regime is attacking Iranian nuclear installations. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=492.59999999999997s)]
*  It's killing civilians, but Iran is to blame. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=496.44s)]
*  So how can Iran have an agreement with such countries, such governments? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=499.76s)]
*  All right. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=504.8s)]
*  So that all makes sense. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=505.8s)]
*  So then the question then becomes, where are we in terms of this conflict? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=506.8s)]
*  There's a lot of triumphalist rhetoric, of course, coming from Israel and the United [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=510.84000000000003s)]
*  States, like there was the last time that Israel struck. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=514.4s)]
*  We took out so many of their air defenses, but also their ballistic missile capabilities. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=517.6s)]
*  If you look at where the strikes actually happened, they all almost most of them seem [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=522.4s)]
*  to have happened in the west of Iran, very few in central Iran and almost none in the [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=526.96s)]
*  east. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=531.52s)]
*  So the question that I have is, you know, the Iranians are vowing a serious retaliatory [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=532.96s)]
*  response commensurate with the attack itself. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=539.92s)]
*  What is Iran's real capability, do you think, at this point to strike Israel in a meaningful [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=543.04s)]
*  way? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=548.0799999999999s)]
*  Well, after all, the Israelis have the support of the collective West and it launched a war [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=551.4399999999999s)]
*  against Iran and they have killed people and they've damaged Iranian assets. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=559.4399999999999s)]
*  A lot of it, though, is misinformation and disinformation. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=565.36s)]
*  And some of the images that people are seeing online are fake or they're from somewhere [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=570.64s)]
*  else or they're AI, but some of them are real. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=576.16s)]
*  And that's what happens in war, especially when one side suddenly in war and aggression. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=579.6800000000001s)]
*  Iran does have a very powerful deterrence, and that is its missile program and its drone [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=587.92s)]
*  program. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=594.48s)]
*  But of course, the Israelis went in with the help of the United States, targeted senior [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=595.6800000000001s)]
*  commanders. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=602.4s)]
*  So they put in place new commanders and they're regrouping. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=602.96s)]
*  And I think that ultimately we will see a significant Iranian response. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=609.6s)]
*  I cannot predict the future, but I am confident that the Israeli regime will not come out on [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=613.52s)]
*  top. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=619.9200000000001s)]
*  They control the internet, they control the propaganda. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=620.16s)]
*  But we have to remember what happened in Yemen. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=623.68s)]
*  The White House said and the Pentagon or the Secretary of Defense said that they're going [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=627.28s)]
*  to defeat these Houthis, as they like to call them, or Ansar Allah and the Yemeni armed [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=632.9599999999999s)]
*  forces. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=640.3199999999999s)]
*  And after a month, we saw they failed and it was the United States that effectively [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=641.3599999999999s)]
*  capitulated. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=645.92s)]
*  So I think that Iran was hard. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=647.52s)]
*  That doesn't mean the war will end. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=651.12s)]
*  Because Netanyahu needs a war. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=653.4399999999999s)]
*  But this is going to get messy. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=655.76s)]
*  But the big question is, do the Americans get involved? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=658.9599999999999s)]
*  If the Americans start striking Iran, then, Glenn, I think we're going to have a global [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=663.28s)]
*  economic catastrophe. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=668.2399999999999s)]
*  Because those tiny Arab family dictatorships in the Persian Gulf, they host American bases. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=670.4s)]
*  Iranians will see them as complicit. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=678.4s)]
*  And if Iran strikes them, or being complicit, they'll be swept away in days, if not hours. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=682.8s)]
*  And that would lead to a global economic meltdown, because the price of oil and gas will go through [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=693.68s)]
*  the roof. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=697.76s)]
*  So hopefully, Trump will be sane enough to stay out of this. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=699.28s)]
*  Although he is involved, he's deeply involved, but not to go further. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=704.0799999999999s)]
*  I don't know how Iran is going to treat the United States for what it is doing now, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=707.8399999999999s)]
*  or how it is going to treat other entities that aren't complicit. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=712.0799999999999s)]
*  Yes, I think you froze a little bit at the end. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=724.16s)]
*  And of course, as you mentioned, because you're in Tehran, there's a slowed down internet. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=727.36s)]
*  But so far, we've heard pretty much everything until the very last few words there, which I [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=731.28s)]
*  think everyone understood the answer. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=736.0s)]
*  Let me ask you this. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=738.96s)]
*  So I think what Trump's posture is now, certainly what he's trying to convey, is, look, I gave [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=739.68s)]
*  you 60 days. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=747.68s)]
*  We didn't get a deal done. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=748.56s)]
*  Today's the 61st day. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=749.6s)]
*  You got a little taste of what will happen to you if we don't get a deal done. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=750.88s)]
*  So now what you ought to do is sign a deal. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=755.84s)]
*  And I think that's something we talked about last night, even before this attack happened, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=758.88s)]
*  which is the whole time the position of Wittkopf and the Trump administration was, yeah, of course, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=763.12s)]
*  Iran needs to have the right to have low levels of enrichment for a nuclear energy program. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=768.96s)]
*  And at some point, the rhetoric changed for Trump of saying they can't have enrichment at all and [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=773.52s)]
*  sort of said, oh, the Iranians, something happened to them. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=778.96s)]
*  They changed. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=781.44s)]
*  Something got into them as though that was something Iran had originally agreed to do or something. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=782.5600000000001s)]
*  I'm not sure Trump even understood the enrichment issue. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=788.16s)]
*  Or if he did, he got convinced that Iran shouldn't have any enrichment, was never going to be a deal. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=791.2s)]
*  Is there any possibility that the Iranians would now sit down with the United States in the hopes [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=795.76s)]
*  of getting a deal to avert further strikes? [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=802.0s)]
*  I think there is any chance whatsoever that Iran will agree to halt nuclear enrichment because [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=806.5600000000001s)]
*  it is a sovereign right of the Iranians. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=813.92s)]
*  It is part of Iran's sovereignty, and the Iranians are not going to give that up. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=816.64s)]
*  Iran's revolution was very much about sovereignty and dependence and making decisions in Tehran, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=824.0s)]
*  alongside supporting the Palestinian cause and the cause of liberation in apartheid South Africa. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=830.88s)]
*  But there isn't a chance in the world that Iran will accept such a thing. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=838.48s)]
*  Iran is willing to accept the International Atomic Energy Agency [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=843.44s)]
*  having been intrusive, and we already did that. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=849.36s)]
*  We had it for many years, but Trump tore up that deal. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=851.6800000000001s)]
*  But Iran is not going to give up its sovereign right, especially since, by doing so, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=856.4s)]
*  Iran would be held hostage. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=862.4s)]
*  If tomorrow the United States prevents Iran from importing nuclear fuel, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=864.72s)]
*  then Iran's nuclear reactors will all have to be shut down. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=869.92s)]
*  These are huge investments, and we know how the United States uses to strangle Iran. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=873.76s)]
*  I don't see any chance whatsoever, under any circumstances, that Iran will accept a deal [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=880.0s)]
*  where it is denied its right as an independent and sovereign country. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=886.56s)]
*  Last question. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=892.7199999999999s)]
*  Obviously, everybody knows it's not exactly a secret that there are major [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=894.16s)]
*  factions in Israel and the United States that don't want just attacks on Iranian nuclear [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=898.08s)]
*  facilities but want regime change in Iran, the restoration of what they call the Iranian [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=904.96s)]
*  monarchy, which was this very brutal and savage dictatorship that was a puppet regime of [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=909.76s)]
*  Tel Aviv and Washington for decades, which the Iranian revolution overthrew. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=916.48s)]
*  They want to reinstall that. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=920.48s)]
*  And there's some people who believe that if Iran doesn't show a real deterrence at this point, [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=922.96s)]
*  namely the ability to strike in meaningful ways, whether it's Israel or U.S. assets in the region [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=930.5600000000001s)]
*  or the Gulf state, that it's almost inevitable that Iran will become sort of a new Syria, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=936.0s)]
*  that they will be able to foment enough attacks on the government, they have proxy forces ready. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=943.6800000000001s)]
*  Is that something you believe is a real possibility, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=949.3599999999999s)]
*  especially in the event that Iran isn't able to mount a real response? [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=951.76s)]
*  I think Iran will mount a very real response. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=958.2399999999999s)]
*  As a part of being in Iran, it has created its own military industry. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=963.04s)]
*  It's developed itself in high-tech fields. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=967.68s)]
*  It's in the region, the most technologically developed country, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=970.8s)]
*  using its own indigenous technology. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=976.4799999999999s)]
*  I think that they will be able to hit back very hard. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=981.12s)]
*  And I think contrary to what the Americans like to believe, the Iranian people [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=986.0s)]
*  have been more united than before by this aggression because they murdered innocent people and because [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=992.8s)]
*  the West is trying to deny Iran its sovereign right. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=1000.9599999999999s)]
*  What they are in fact doing is making the Iranian people more demanding of the government [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=1004.96s)]
*  to retaliate. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=1014.48s)]
*  And so right now the expectation in Iran is that the armed forces hit the Israelis very hard. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=1015.44s)]
*  The United States and the West, their so-called Iran experts, are always miscalculating. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=1025.36s)]
*  They hire like-minded people or these Iranians who say what needs to be said in their think tanks, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=1032.0800000000002s)]
*  or they hire them for media and they repeat the narratives of the West. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=1042.16s)]
*  And then these people get money and then they give money to those politicians to [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=1046.8s)]
*  participate in their programs. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=1052.72s)]
*  And everyone is saying the same thing, and it's well funded, and people have a good [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=1054.24s)]
*  living standard of living as a result. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=1061.6799999999998s)]
*  But it creates a very misleading picture of Iran in the United States, just as it does [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=1064.3999999999999s)]
*  about Russia and other countries. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=1069.28s)]
*  Push a little bit harder, Iran will collapse. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=1073.12s)]
*  They've been saying that for decades. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=1075.28s)]
*  The narrative hasn't changed. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=1077.04s)]
*  But what I think is going to happen is it's going to create guillotine, in fact, [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=1079.12s)]
*  towards the West, especially after the Iranians have witnessed 20 months of genocide in Gaza. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1cS50acU_w&t=1084.0s)]
