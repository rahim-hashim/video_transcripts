# WATCH: Taylor Lorenzâ€™s Pathological Take on Mass Media Collapse
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [January 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us)
*  One of the people who has decided that she is a success story, who regards herself as [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=0.0s)]
*  one of the giants of American journalism, is Taylor Renz, who used to work at the New [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  York Times, caused one drama after the next, then made her way to the Washington Post. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=17.52s)]
*  She basically, as we're going to show you, started her career by hanging outside of houses [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=24.16s)]
*  that are filled with 16 and 17 year old TikTok influencers, where she would try and induce [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=30.28s)]
*  them to speak to her and give her secrets. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=36.36s)]
*  She would go and get 17 year olds canceled. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=41.2s)]
*  And so she built a TikTok platform just by using the names over and over of 17 year old [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=44.96s)]
*  boys who were extremely popular among adolescent girls, even though she was 40 when doing it. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=50.6s)]
*  And somehow this convinced her that she's some kind of like giant of American journalism [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=56.64s)]
*  who now is in a position to issue state of the media addresses, similar to the way the [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=60.480000000000004s)]
*  president issues a state of the union address. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=66.92s)]
*  And so she went to TikTok to talk about the reason why her entire generation basically [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=70.04s)]
*  has proven to be complete failures. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=79.52000000000001s)]
*  And I think it's really worth listening to what she has to say, obviously not because [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=82.72s)]
*  there's any wisdom in it, but because it illustrates the pathologies and sicknesses that have caused [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=87.12s)]
*  the collapse of that part of the media and the unbelievable inability to accept responsibility. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=93.32000000000001s)]
*  Even though she purports to say, some of this is our fault, you'll see in the way in which [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=102.0s)]
*  she says it, it's really just the pretense of accepting responsibility, but not actually [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=107.96000000000001s)]
*  any attempt to grapple with the true pathologies of media. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=113.04s)]
*  The entire journalism industry is basically in a freefall. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=115.88s)]
*  Today, the Los Angeles Times laid off 115 employees. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  They wiped out their entire DC bureau in an election year. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=122.4s)]
*  They laid off pretty much all of their sports teams. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=125.76s)]
*  They killed their entire tech and business section. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=128.2s)]
*  They laid off breaking news writers, social media editors. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=130.52s)]
*  The list goes on. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=133.52s)]
*  But what's really dark is this is just the latest in months and months and months of [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=134.64s)]
*  layoffs in the media industry. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=139.07999999999998s)]
*  In fact, tens of thousands of journalists have been laid off in the past year. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=140.96s)]
*  Major media companies like Buzzfeed News have completely shuttered their news operations. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=145.68s)]
*  Time Magazine also just laid off a ton of people and oh, Sports Illustrated basically [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=150.07999999999998s)]
*  shut down last week. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=153.68s)]
*  Pretty much the entire digital media ecosystem that myself and a lot of other millennial [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=155.12s)]
*  journalists came up in has been completely hollowed out. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=159.16s)]
*  And it's not just digital media. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=162.07999999999998s)]
*  I got to just let her repeat that sentence because I love it so much. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=163.51999999999998s)]
*  It's like kind of sweet dessert just entering my body and animating everyone and myself. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=167.35999999999999s)]
*  Listen to this sentence. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=176.67999999999998s)]
*  The entire digital media ecosystem that myself and a lot of other millennial journalists [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=178.79999999999998s)]
*  came up in has been completely hollowed out. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=182.83999999999997s)]
*  And it's not just [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=185.2s)]
*  The area of media that myself and a lot of my fellow digital millennial journalists has [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=185.88s)]
*  and have been completely hollowed out. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=191.72s)]
*  That is exactly what has happened. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=194.6s)]
*  And there are very good and valid reasons for it. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=198.04s)]
*  And while I said, as I said, I don't take pleasure in watching people lose their jobs [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=202.16s)]
*  and be sad about it, I absolutely take pleasure in the hollowing out of industries that are [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=206.07999999999998s)]
*  very toxic and damaging to our society and to our Republic, which includes this one. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=211.51999999999998s)]
*  Just digital media sites. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=217.23999999999998s)]
*  Local news has been obliterated. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=218.51999999999998s)]
*  The newspaper industry is cratering. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=220.6s)]
*  Radio is essentially dead, aside from NPR, which has been gutted. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=223.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, hundreds of workers at Conde Nast, the parent company of pretty much every major [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=226.88s)]
*  magazine from GQ to Vogue to The New Yorker to Vanity Fair, are on strike because they're [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=231.0s)]
*  also facing impending layoffs. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=236.95999999999998s)]
*  Even mainstream national media outlets owned by billionaires like The Washington Post, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=239.0s)]
*  where I work, and The Atlantic, where I used to work, have done layoffs. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=243.35999999999999s)]
*  If you're a young journalist today, there's almost no on-ramp to traditional journalism. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=246.84s)]
*  Even if you do get a job, journalists' salaries have been stagnant and even declined. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=251.0s)]
*  And by the way, we don't make that much to begin with. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=255.08s)]
*  I don't think people understand how bad the world would be without journalists. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=257.04s)]
*  Oh, people understand that the world would be bad without journalists. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=260.92s)]
*  In fact, that's exactly the problem we have, is that none of these people are actually [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=267.96s)]
*  journalists. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=272.68s)]
*  They do not perform the journalistic function. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=273.68s)]
*  The journalistic function, and if you go and look at what people for hundreds of years [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=275.76s)]
*  have been describing as the core purpose of the press, the reason there's a freedom of [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=281.56s)]
*  the press guaranteeing the First Amendment, is because we need a mechanism to confront [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=285.03999999999996s)]
*  and undermine and subvert and check institutions of authority and the most powerful people [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=291.76s)]
*  in our country. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=298.46s)]
*  That's what journalism is for. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=299.46s)]
*  It's to bring them down pegs. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=301.52s)]
*  And what instead has happened is that these people who work in these corporations have [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=303.59999999999997s)]
*  done the opposite of that. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=310.28s)]
*  They're the ones who are causing our country to be without journalists, even though they [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=312.11999999999995s)]
*  bear the HR title of journalists because they have done the opposite of what that function [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=316.35999999999996s)]
*  is. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=320.88s)]
*  They serve power. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=321.88s)]
*  They disseminate its propaganda. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=323.4s)]
*  They do not challenge or investigate these institutions of authority. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=325.2s)]
*  The people they investigate and challenge are ordinary citizens in the country. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=329.24s)]
*  Taylor Renz's biggest story as a journalist was uncovering the private citizen who ran [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=334.72s)]
*  the Lives of TikTok account. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=344.2s)]
*  Taylor Renz has never challenged or exposed any lies or secrets or corruption in the CIA [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=348.76s)]
*  or in the FBI or in Wall Street or in Silicon Valley. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=357.0s)]
*  I think her second biggest story is that one time she was in the app Clubhouse and she [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=362.08s)]
*  heard somebody use the word retarded and she ran to Twitter and told like a title tale [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=368.08s)]
*  and she attributed it to Marc Andreessen and it turned out Marc Andreessen had not said [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=374.36s)]
*  that so she had to correct her second biggest story. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=378.32s)]
*  Taylor Renz has more corrections appended to her stories than almost any person working [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=380.96s)]
*  in media and the amazing thing about that is her stories are so trivial that it's almost [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=386.24s)]
*  impossible to even get an editor to care enough to correct them and yet she has a mountain [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=392.12s)]
*  of them. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=396.4s)]
*  Long ones, big ones, major ones. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=397.4s)]
*  And yet she seems to think she's the success story and on some level, bizarrely, she kind [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=402.0s)]
*  of is given that she's at least been able to draw attention to herself just because [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=407.4s)]
*  she's so, she's just such an extreme kind of, she's almost like a little girl. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=411.24s)]
*  Like high camp at this point. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=416.96000000000004s)]
*  I have to say that I've kind of come to appreciate Taylor Renz in the way that just these kind [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=417.96000000000004s)]
*  of people can have this sort of campy iconic appeal but there's nothing positive about [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=425.44s)]
*  her journalistically except for the fact that she provides a window into the pathology that [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=431.36s)]
*  is causing it to collapse. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=436.0s)]
*  So she is right that society is worse off without journalists and the problem is that [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=439.16s)]
*  the more people employed by these big media corporations, the less journalists we have. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=446.16s)]
*  And that's why I say it is not just well deserved but a cause for celebration to watch these [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=451.76000000000005s)]
*  outlets that have done far more misleading and far more propagandizing and far more attacking [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=456.8s)]
*  of ordinary citizens than powerful breakdown and collapse and disintegrate because they're [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=463.20000000000005s)]
*  anti-journalism and not journalism and because of their failures, people are paying increasing [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=469.44s)]
*  attention to independent media, people who have offered something that the public is [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=475.0s)]
*  interested in to develop a level of trust and faith that you can find people who will [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=479.0s)]
*  inform you, who will do their best to tell you what they see is happening. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=484.28000000000003s)]
*  You may not always agree with them but you know that they are at least doing their best [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=488.2s)]
*  and have no constraints, no corporate constraints on the sorts of things they can and can't [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=491.36s)]
*  say. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=496.8s)]
*  During Russiagate when it was dominating the news, when I was out there constantly [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=498.8s)]
*  expressing skepticism and doubt and pointing out all the evidentiary flaws in the primary [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=508.2s)]
*  Russiagate narrative that every day almost every major corporate outlet in this country [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=512.96s)]
*  was ratifying and endorsing, I got emails or DMs from people who work inside these media [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=517.92s)]
*  outlets who are people who are kind of mid-career writing to me and saying thank you so much [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=525.84s)]
*  for doing what you're doing, I wish I could do it but I feel like I can't because in corporate [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=532.5200000000001s)]
*  media, in liberal corporate media, the minute someone steps out of line or sticks their [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=537.6800000000001s)]
*  head up in any way to challenge liberal orthodoxy, they get mauled by liberal Twitter, they become [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=541.38s)]
*  the first on the list for when layoffs happen and the last to be hired because no editor, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=548.44s)]
*  no news outlet wants to be screamed at by liberals on Twitter for having hired a heretic. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=555.32s)]
*  And every journalist who works in these major corporations knows that the only way to advance [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=559.32s)]
*  is to stay in line, to be conformist, to serve orthodoxies and never to question it. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=565.0600000000001s)]
*  And nothing is more corrosive of the journalistic spirit and ethos than that and that is why [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=570.94s)]
*  these sectors are collapsing. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=576.72s)]
*  When I watched that video from the Washington Post's Taylor N's, the one I just showed [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=579.0600000000001s)]
*  in which she kind of postured as the dean of digital era American journalism, sermonizing [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=583.02s)]
*  about what went wrong and what she referred to as her sector of the media, I was so transfixed [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=587.9s)]
*  by the utter absurdity of that person that I really could not muster a rational analysis [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=593.14s)]
*  of anything she said. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=597.26s)]
*  Taylor, by the way, now identifies as a disabled person because she claims she suffers from [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=598.9799999999999s)]
*  long COVID and various immunosuppressive disorders which is more or less exactly what one would [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=603.78s)]
*  expect from her. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=609.62s)]
*  So perhaps the deep compassion that I feel for her predicament also prevented me from [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=610.62s)]
*  being able to dissect this address that she delivers to the public about the state of [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=614.22s)]
*  the media. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=618.86s)]
*  But fortunately, someone put into words exactly what my sentiments about all of this are. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=619.86s)]
*  She is the media analyst and political commentator Hannah Cox who, among other things, is a fellow [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=625.38s)]
*  of one of my favorite DC activist groups, the White Coast Waste Project, which has done [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=630.42s)]
*  a remarkable job in building a very bipartisan coalition to oppose federal spending on gruesome [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=634.86s)]
*  and completely unnecessary medical experiments on animals. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=640.94s)]
*  And in a single tweet, Hannah not only identifies the glaring and hilarious flaws in Lorenz's [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=645.02s)]
*  pretentious speech, but way more importantly, she identifies these broader developments [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=650.5s)]
*  governing the collapse of traditional corporate media and the rise of independent media. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=654.5s)]
*  So as soon as I saw that tweet, I reached out to her and asked her to come on to discuss [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=658.7s)]
*  her analysis and was very delighted when I learned that she had the time to do so tonight. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=662.74s)]
*  And we are very delighted to welcome her to her debut appearance on the system update. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=668.0600000000001s)]
*  Hannah, thank you so much for taking the time. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=672.14s)]
*  I'm excited to talk to you about all of this. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=673.7s)]
*  Thank you so much for having me. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=676.7s)]
*  I'm a huge fan of your work, so it's wonderful to be here. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=677.7s)]
*  That's nice of you to say. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=680.1800000000001s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=681.1800000000001s)]
*  So before we get into these broader themes, and like I said, I don't want to make this [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=682.1800000000001s)]
*  focus on Taylor Lorenz in part because it's not particularly significant, even though [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=686.22s)]
*  it is extremely entertaining to talk about her. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=690.1s)]
*  I just want to get your kind of what was your visceral reaction upon listening to that video? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=692.98s)]
*  Well, I like you just love to hate on Taylor Lorenz. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=699.18s)]
*  I think that's the only reason she has a career is because she just makes people so angry [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=703.3s)]
*  they can't look away. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=706.78s)]
*  It's a total train wreck. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=707.78s)]
*  And, you know, I run an independent media company called Base Politics. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=708.78s)]
*  We are a nonprofit, but we are in this sector where we are focusing on new media, on podcasts, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=712.3s)]
*  on YouTube, on Instagram and TikTok. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=717.38s)]
*  And I found it exceedingly condescending, first and foremost, her assertion that journalism [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=720.14s)]
*  is dying. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=725.74s)]
*  Journalism is alive and well. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=726.9399999999999s)]
*  People appreciate actual journalism and they're willing to pay for it. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=728.34s)]
*  What's dying is the mainstream legacy media that has failed to innovate and that also, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=731.5s)]
*  like you said, has become more of an arm for the state and more of a propaganda machine [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=736.46s)]
*  than actual journalistic outlets. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=740.74s)]
*  So I guess they don't assign Who Moved My Cheese to read in journalism schools these [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=742.9s)]
*  days, but I think people like Taylor need to pick up the book because the amount of [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=746.98s)]
*  entitlement that came across in this video really just slaps you across the face. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=751.6999999999999s)]
*  You know, she's saying that these outlets are owned by billionaires and yet they're [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=756.22s)]
*  laying all these people off as if because these people are billionaires, they should [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=758.98s)]
*  have to keep losing money for crappy work that people don't want to pay for. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=762.8199999999999s)]
*  At the end of the day, her work and that of many of her colleagues is not creating value [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=766.26s)]
*  for people. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=770.42s)]
*  People don't trust it. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=771.42s)]
*  I saw a recent poll that actually said 50% of Americans believe that the mainstream media [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=772.9399999999999s)]
*  intentionally lies and misleads them. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=776.78s)]
*  And so she doesn't connect this fact that in order to have a job in doing something, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=779.6999999999999s)]
*  you have to create value in that job and she's no longer doing it, but she expects to still [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=784.0999999999999s)]
*  have a cushy job and thinks all of her other colleagues should as well. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=788.02s)]
*  Meanwhile, the people I think who have worked in the sector for some time, who have energy, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=791.9799999999999s)]
*  who are entrepreneurial, who have this sort of innovative genes, they've left these companies [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=796.38s)]
*  because they are very restraining, because you cannot speak truth to power within them [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=800.6600000000001s)]
*  because they often are so bipartisan that people really can't talk about things that [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=804.9000000000001s)]
*  matter or ever sort of cut through all of the noise out there. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=810.14s)]
*  And so those types of people have already left and they're doing just fine on places [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=813.62s)]
*  like Substack and YouTube. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=817.0200000000001s)]
*  She tries to undermine people in this kind of capacity and say that they're not as trustworthy, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=819.22s)]
*  they can't be fact checked or their videos are too short. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=823.22s)]
*  What people want is shorter video and sometimes long form video as well. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=826.3s)]
*  But on top of that, this assertion that these people are less credible than her is hilarious [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=831.2199999999999s)]
*  because the mainstream media gets it wrong all the time. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=835.66s)]
*  From COVID, they were not the ones that broke the story, by the way, on who was actually [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=839.74s)]
*  funding that Wuhan lab. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=843.5s)]
*  It was the White Coat Waste Project, who you mentioned earlier, who I'm a fellow for, who [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=844.6999999999999s)]
*  happened to be doing the work of journalists because they were filing Freedom of Information [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=848.3s)]
*  acts trying to figure out if gain of function was happening because it is animal torture. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=852.22s)]
*  And so they had sort of the smoking gun. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=856.74s)]
*  They couldn't even get the mainstream media to publish that information for well over [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=858.82s)]
*  a year. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=862.6600000000001s)]
*  And it wasn't until Rand Paul took that information and encountered Dr. Fauci with it that all [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=863.6600000000001s)]
*  of a sudden you saw the mainstream media start to change their tune and say, oh, maybe we [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=868.22s)]
*  were funding this lab. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=871.22s)]
*  Maybe this thing could have been lab created. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=872.46s)]
*  I think the amount of trust that people have lost in these institutions is valid. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=874.34s)]
*  They are not in any way more credible. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=878.76s)]
*  Fact checks are often laughably incorrect. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=881.1800000000001s)]
*  I recently had to run a fact check on the fact checkers at USA Today a few weeks ago [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=883.62s)]
*  because they were claiming that there is a kill switch that they put in place for all [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=888.26s)]
*  vehicles beginning in 2026. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=892.1800000000001s)]
*  Representative Thomas Massey was trying to get that overturned and they were calling [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=894.9s)]
*  him crazy saying that this hadn't been passed and using really ridiculous language to sort [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=898.62s)]
*  of dance around the fact that that was exactly what was in the legislation. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=902.78s)]
*  So from really big things like COVID and its origins to war to basic pieces of legislation [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=905.72s)]
*  and what's in them and how it's going to impact the American people, they aren't doing their [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=911.96s)]
*  job. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=915.0s)]
*  They are not credible. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=916.0s)]
*  There's no way that you can hang their hat on what they're doing. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=917.0s)]
*  And so people are right to turn to independent media. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=919.72s)]
*  And lastly, I'll say just before I pause, you know, I also thought there was a lot of [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=922.96s)]
*  a victim mentality in Taylor's video, which you often see from Taylor. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=926.96s)]
*  She really likes to play the victim. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=930.74s)]
*  And I just think that it is such a slap in the face to journalists who are actually putting [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=932.8s)]
*  their lives on the line. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=936.92s)]
*  There have been over 80 journalists killed in Gaza in the past couple of months as they [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=938.4s)]
*  are trying to report on war crimes that are happening there. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=942.4s)]
*  You yourself have put yourself on the line and endangered your safety both in the U.S. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=945.8s)]
*  and in Brazil at times. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=949.52s)]
*  Like Julian Assange is still sitting in prison for his reporting. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=951.0s)]
*  I mean, there are so many journalists who are doing incredible work and who really are [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=955.08s)]
*  sacrificing everything to bring people information and to try to push back on the powers that [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=959.28s)]
*  be. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=963.8399999999999s)]
*  And so for her to try to play victim was just really disrespectful, I thought, to the actual [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=964.8399999999999s)]
*  craft of journalism. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=968.68s)]
*  That time that she went on MSNBC and started weeping about how essentially she's so endangered [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=970.52s)]
*  because people criticize her on the Internet when she has never in her life challenged [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=978.0799999999999s)]
*  a single person of any power. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=983.8399999999999s)]
*  I've watched people like Julian Assange rot in prison. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=986.4s)]
*  I've seen journalists killed in war zones. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=989.24s)]
*  Several governments have attempted to prosecute me and illegally spy on me and all kinds of [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=993.4s)]
*  journalists who, as you say, put themselves in danger all the time. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=997.28s)]
*  And these millennial journalists who basically have turned themselves into arms of the powerful [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1001.0s)]
*  really believe that because they're occasionally criticized by people on Twitter who then are [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1005.84s)]
*  incensored that they are actually somehow really victimized. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1010.24s)]
*  And it was amazing. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1014.24s)]
*  A couple times now Taylor Renz has been allowed to write articles and columns that refer to [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1017.2s)]
*  me and I know I'm polarizing to a lot of people, but my journalism and my career speaks for [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1021.9200000000001s)]
*  itself and she was permitted to repeatedly refer to me as if it were my title as a right-wing [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1029.48s)]
*  influencer, as though I'm some sort of TikTok dancer while she continues to call herself [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1034.56s)]
*  a reporter. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1041.96s)]
*  The reason is because ideologically the Washington Post sees me as an enemy and therefore anything [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1042.96s)]
*  goes and I think that's so much of what people have come to realize about this kind of new [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1048.0s)]
*  crop of journalists is they have thrown all caution to the wind. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1053.96s)]
*  The other thing I just want to pick up on what you said, obviously it's always going [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1057.28s)]
*  to be the case that media outlets are going to make mistakes. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1063.4s)]
*  This has been the case forever. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1065.96s)]
*  Human beings make mistakes. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1068.2s)]
*  Human institutions are fallible. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1069.44s)]
*  The solution though when you make a mistake is that you own up to it as quickly as possible. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1071.6s)]
*  You account for how that error happened. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1077.36s)]
*  You apologize for it. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1078.9199999999998s)]
*  You correct it. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1080.0s)]
*  You retract it. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1081.0s)]
*  The lies that we're talking about that this sector of the media has told that is now failing [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1082.0s)]
*  are not trivial stories or incidental details they got wrong. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1086.12s)]
*  They were the ones who for the first several months of the pandemic pronounced that it [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1091.82s)]
*  that the COVID pandemic did not emanate from a lab in Wuhan and that anyone who said otherwise [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1097.76s)]
*  was engaged in false conspiracy theories to the point that they got censored from the [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1105.2s)]
*  internet. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1108.84s)]
*  The thing that drives me the craziest to this day is that prior to the 2020 campaign, they [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1109.84s)]
*  ratified the CIA lie that came from the bowels of the CIA that the reporting on Hunter Biden [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1116.2s)]
*  activities in Ukraine and in China in connection with the Biden family was Russian disinformation. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1122.8000000000002s)]
*  Everyone now knows that was a fabrication. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1128.96s)]
*  Not one media outlet has that spread those lies has ever felt the need to come and say, [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1131.04s)]
*  here's why we got this wrong. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1136.8000000000002s)]
*  We apologize for having done so. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1138.42s)]
*  Here's what went wrong. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1140.4s)]
*  Here's what we're going to do in the future. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1141.4s)]
*  Why is it that why do you think it is that people like us can kind of look at these lies [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1143.8400000000001s)]
*  that they have told on so many critical stories. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1150.96s)]
*  They drown the country and Russia gate for two or three years only for that investigation [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1153.48s)]
*  to end debunking the core conspiracy theories. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1158.48s)]
*  So many examples that you can give. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1161.08s)]
*  And I really think they don't see that that they don't see that they have been more responsible [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1163.56s)]
*  for the dissemination of disinformation than almost any other source of information in [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1170.56s)]
*  the United States. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1176.08s)]
*  Why is it that you think they're so incapable of understanding the validity of these critiques? [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1177.08s)]
*  Oh, I don't think that is that they misunderstand. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1181.48s)]
*  I think that they are arrogant. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1184.9199999999998s)]
*  I think that they have every assurance in their minds that the government's going to [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1186.56s)]
*  come in and save them and shroud them from competition. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1190.04s)]
*  They're working all the time for this right now. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1193.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1196.12s)]
*  And Taylor Lorenz is notorious for going after tech and saying the government needs to regulate [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1197.12s)]
*  tech companies more. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1200.12s)]
*  And you'll often hear them going after things like Section 230. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1201.12s)]
*  There was the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1205.3600000000001s)]
*  They're introducing all these bills saying we're trying to protect journalism. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1207.56s)]
*  We want to make sure that journalists can still compete in a modern world. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1210.4s)]
*  But really what they're trying to do in these pieces of legislation, we dig into them, is [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1213.6s)]
*  eliminate independent competition. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1217.84s)]
*  They are really trying to ensure that independent media outlets, independent journalists cannot [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1220.0s)]
*  compete with them. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1225.4s)]
*  They're trying to find ways where they can get together and collectively bargain with [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1226.4s)]
*  social media companies so that only their articles and links can appear essentially. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1229.4s)]
*  It's really, really corrupt. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1234.52s)]
*  But I think because they do work so hand-in-hand with the state, and you're correct, they absolutely [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1235.8s)]
*  worked with the state to censor people on social media during COVID. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1240.16s)]
*  But oftentimes when they're getting their facts or they're bringing you their sources, [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1243.8s)]
*  it's just people in government that they're talking to. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1247.32s)]
*  It's not like they're going on the ground and really getting in the nitty-gritty and [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1249.4s)]
*  doing serious reporting. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1253.0s)]
*  They're just calling their buddies in the intelligence community and then just trotting [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1254.08s)]
*  out whatever line they're given from these guys. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1257.64s)]
*  But because they have had that cozy relationship for so long, I think they have every assurance [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1259.52s)]
*  that they believe the government's going to come in and save them and squash their competition. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1264.08s)]
*  And they really don't. I don't think they have totally wrapped their minds around just how [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1268.16s)]
*  far out of the gate this is. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1272.16s)]
*  And that's because they have been so slow to innovate. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1273.56s)]
*  You know, most of the people who are running these newspapers or who are writing for them, [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1275.72s)]
*  they're not the innovators, the people who are. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1280.04s)]
*  They're already out here doing the kinds of work that you and I are doing. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1282.04s)]
*  So they don't quite understand just how far gone it is. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1285.44s)]
*  TikTok is now the top search engine for I think 40 percent of Americans and growing [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1287.56s)]
*  every day. People increasingly do not trust institutions whatsoever. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1292.72s)]
*  They're seeking out individuals that they like, that they have good relationships with, [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1297.16s)]
*  that they identify with online. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1301.68s)]
*  That's who they want to get their information from. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1303.2s)]
*  They have a healthy distrust of the media. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1305.28s)]
*  And they've seen how corrupt the media is as well, not just in their horrible reporting [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1306.96s)]
*  style, but in the tactics that they use. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1311.6000000000001s)]
*  You know, Taylor herself has outright doxed people. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1313.44s)]
*  So, I mean, she's gone so far as to actually publish people's home addresses and work [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1316.24s)]
*  addresses and then has the audacity to go and cry about online bullying and harassment [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1320.08s)]
*  that she faces. They lie about people. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1325.24s)]
*  They ruin their reputations. They try to get people fired. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1327.8799999999999s)]
*  I mean, people are not going to forget this kind of thing. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1331.0s)]
*  I think when it comes to the pace of the media and how often they're wrong in their [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1333.32s)]
*  reporting, that can slip by people because Americans are busy and there's just so much [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1337.52s)]
*  news coming at them every day. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1341.84s)]
*  But these deeper sentiments about the way they behave, I don't think are going to be [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1343.48s)]
*  forgotten. But I do think people need to be on guard against these kinds of legislation [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1347.68s)]
*  they're trying to pass in order to try to squash competition. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113Q8DVh-Us&t=1351.72s)]
