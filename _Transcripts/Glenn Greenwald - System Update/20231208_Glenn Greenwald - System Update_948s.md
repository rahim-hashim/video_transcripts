# Ivy Leagues Fold on Free Speech After Congress Shakedown
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [December 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0)
*  The U.S. Congress hauled three university presidents before the Congress, one from Harvard, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=0.0s)]
*  one from the University of Penn, University of Pennsylvania, and the other from MIT. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  And Elise Stefanik, the Republican from New York, a very, very ardent supporter of Israel, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=23.36s)]
*  someone who's been claiming that there's a grave anti-Semitism crisis in the United States [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=29.96s)]
*  that requires more restrictions on speech on college campuses, question them about whether [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=33.52s)]
*  a student would be punished or should be punished for expressing genocidal arguments about Jews. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=39.8s)]
*  This is the exchange. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  Does at MIT, does calling for the genocide of Jews violate MIT's code of conduct or rules [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=49.36s)]
*  regarding bullying and harassment? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=57.36s)]
*  If targeted at individuals not making public statements. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=59.92s)]
*  Yes or no? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=63.32s)]
*  Calling for the genocide of Jews does not constitute bullying and harassment? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=66.08s)]
*  I have not heard calling for the genocide for Jews on our campus. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=69.48s)]
*  But you've heard chants for intifada. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=72.92s)]
*  I've heard chants which can be anti-Semitic depending on the context when calling for [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=74.72s)]
*  the elimination of the Jewish people. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=80.8s)]
*  So those would not be according to the MIT's code of conduct or rules? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=83.64s)]
*  That would be investigated as harassment if pervasive and severe. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=88.68s)]
*  Ms. McGill, at Penn, does calling for the genocide of Jews violate Penn's rules or code [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=94.4s)]
*  of conduct? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  Yes or no? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=101.96000000000001s)]
*  If the speech turns into conduct, it can be harassment. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=106.44000000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=109.44000000000001s)]
*  I am asking specifically calling for the genocide of Jews. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=110.44000000000001s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=114.08000000000001s)]
*  Do you see the distinction they're drawing? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=115.08000000000001s)]
*  First of all, this is not in a vacuum that this is happening. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=118.48s)]
*  And when the president of MIT said, I haven't heard anybody calling for the genocide of [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=122.75999999999999s)]
*  Jews, she immediately said, well, I mean things like calls for the intifada. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=128.76s)]
*  The intifada is an Arabic word that simply means uprising. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=133.48s)]
*  Uprising against when they call for an intifada, they mean an uprising against the Israeli [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=138.96s)]
*  government for its denial of statehood to the Palestinians, for its occupation of the [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=143.04s)]
*  West Bank, for its blockade of Gaza. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=147.2s)]
*  And the first intifada was overwhelmingly peaceful, especially for the first couple [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=150.64s)]
*  of weeks or the first several months. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=155.0s)]
*  And there's nothing inherently violent about the term intifada, but even if it is, it is [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=158.39999999999998s)]
*  not a term against Jews. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=162.48s)]
*  It is a term against the Israeli government. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=163.92s)]
*  And just like you're allowed to say, I think we should bomb Iran or go to war in Iraq or [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=168.12s)]
*  flatten Gaza, people are allowed to say, to allow to opine, to allow to have the view [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=175.92s)]
*  in the United States of America that the repression by the Israeli government has become sufficiently [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=182.64s)]
*  severe that an uprising or even violence against the state of Israel is warranted as a reaction [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=189.56s)]
*  to that repression. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=196.28s)]
*  You may not like that view. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=197.51999999999998s)]
*  You may think it's a terrible view. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=198.76s)]
*  You may get offended by that view. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=200.28s)]
*  There's no question whatsoever that calling for intifada or even saying the Palestinians [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=202.16s)]
*  should be free from the river to the sea, just like the Likud Charter says, all the [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=209.44s)]
*  land from the river to the sea belongs to Israel, either one of those views, you are [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=214.96s)]
*  allowed to opine that way in the United States. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=219.48s)]
*  So when she's asking, will people be held in violation of the Code of Conduct for genocide [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=222.32s)]
*  of the Jews, the context of this is the attempt to conflate pro-Palestinian statements like [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=230.04s)]
*  an intifada, like resistance, like Palestinians should be free from the river to the sea, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=236.28s)]
*  to imply that these are genocidal against Jews, even though they're not. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=241.6s)]
*  And that's the reason they're so reluctant to say yes, because they don't want to limit [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=245.07999999999998s)]
*  free speech on this issue to punish people who say what they're actually saying. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=250.64s)]
*  Now there's an attempt to convince people that there are these hordes of Muslims and [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=257.2s)]
*  Arabs rolling around campuses calling for the killing of all Jews, chanting, gas the [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=263.5s)]
*  Jews, kill all Jews, murder all Jews. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=269.0s)]
*  This is not happening. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=270.84s)]
*  I repeatedly asked on social media, please, anyone, give me an example of college students [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=274.08s)]
*  chanting gas all Jews or kill the Jews. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=279.84s)]
*  It doesn't happen. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=282.64s)]
*  It's not happening. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=283.64s)]
*  It's not happening. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=285.08s)]
*  It is. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=286.08s)]
*  It's in the most isolated cases. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=287.08s)]
*  What really is going on here is that there is an attempt by a lot of people on the right [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=288.64s)]
*  who have spent years pretending to defend free speech on college campuses to hate censorship, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=294.0s)]
*  but also people who are just establishment liberals, Israel supporters, basically. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=299.84s)]
*  There is an attempt to limit the free speech rights of Americans and people on American [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=304.28s)]
*  campuses in order to protect this foreign country of Israel. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=310.4s)]
*  And the way they're doing that is by conflating criticisms of Israel or defense of the Palestinian [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=314.44s)]
*  people's right to respond with genocide, even though those two are not the same. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=320.96s)]
*  And for those of you who think it is the same, let me just say this. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=331.08s)]
*  If you listen to left liberal censorship advocates, people who have been calling for [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=335.23999999999995s)]
*  conservative students to be punished on college campuses or to have their events banned or [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=340.24s)]
*  their college groups banned, they don't say, oh, we want this to happen because someone [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=345.6s)]
*  misgendered someone. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=351.28000000000003s)]
*  This is like a caricature I keep hearing. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=352.6s)]
*  Oh, well, when they do it, they want people censored and punished just for misgendering. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=354.32s)]
*  This is different. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=359.78000000000003s)]
*  This is calling for genocide. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=360.78000000000003s)]
*  That is not what they think. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=362.04s)]
*  They think that conservative right-wing speech on things like policing and race and immigration [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=363.40000000000003s)]
*  and trans issues are genocidal. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=370.72s)]
*  They believe the speech is intended to provoke violence against minority groups. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=373.64000000000004s)]
*  They believe that what conservatives really are saying and really want is the murder of [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=377.72s)]
*  black people and immigrants and trans people. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=386.12s)]
*  They say it's genocidal. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=388.92s)]
*  It's the same theory of censorship that is being used here. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=390.24s)]
*  This is not a hypothetical question she's asking. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=394.44000000000005s)]
*  She's asking it in the context where there is a claim that there is genocidal speech [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=397.84s)]
*  taking place on college campuses against American Jews, even though what they mean by that is [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=401.67999999999995s)]
*  not I want all Jews dead or gas all Jews, but I believe violence against the Israeli [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=405.59999999999997s)]
*  government is necessary or I believe that a resistance against Israel is justified. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=411.11999999999995s)]
*  And you don't have to like the view to understand how dangerous it is to feed this theory that [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=417.08s)]
*  college administrators should be censoring and punishing students because they're commenting [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=424.8s)]
*  with dissent on the Israeli Gaza war. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=429.52000000000004s)]
*  Here's the rest of this. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=432.08s)]
*  Does that constitute bullying or harassment? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=433.08s)]
*  If it is directed and severe or pervasive, it is harassment. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=438.40000000000003s)]
*  So the answer is yes. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=442.2s)]
*  It is a context-dependent decision, Congresswoman. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=444.16s)]
*  It's a context-dependent decision. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=446.82s)]
*  That's your testimony today. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=448.76s)]
*  Calling for the genocide of Jews is depending upon the context. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=450.22s)]
*  That is not bullying or harassment. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=454.44s)]
*  This is the easiest question to answer. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=456.44s)]
*  Yes, Ms. McGill. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=458.96s)]
*  So is your testimony that you will not answer yes? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=462.4s)]
*  If it is, if the speech becomes conduct, it can be harassment. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=465.4s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=472.44s)]
*  Conduct meaning committing the act of genocide? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=473.44s)]
*  The speech is not harassment. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=476.64s)]
*  This is unacceptable, Ms. McGill. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=478.76s)]
*  Okay, the reason why this irritates me and agitates me so much is because you want college [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=481.03999999999996s)]
*  administrators to draw these distinctions that they were trying to draw. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=488.35999999999996s)]
*  If a college student goes up to a Jewish student and screams in their face, intifada, and harasses [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=493.71999999999997s)]
*  them that way, that becomes conduct. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=501.59999999999997s)]
*  But I thought words aren't violence. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=505.15999999999997s)]
*  I thought that was the entire right-wing case against campus censorship. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=507.24s)]
*  And these administrators are trying to say, we're not going to punish only words. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=513.9200000000001s)]
*  We're not going to punish only speech. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=517.44s)]
*  We would punish it if it turns into conduct. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=518.8000000000001s)]
*  Here's the rest. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=524.28s)]
*  ...opportunity for the world to see your answer. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=525.28s)]
*  Does calling for the genocide of Jews violate Penn's code of conduct when it comes to bullying [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=529.76s)]
*  and harassment? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=536.14s)]
*  Yes or no? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=537.14s)]
*  It can be harassment. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=541.1s)]
*  The answer is yes. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=542.9399999999999s)]
*  And Dr. Gay, at Harvard, does calling for the genocide of Jews violate Harvard's rules [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=544.98s)]
*  of bullying and harassment? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=550.98s)]
*  Yes or no? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=552.66s)]
*  It can be, depending on the context. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=554.34s)]
*  What's the context? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=557.26s)]
*  Targeted as an individual. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=559.14s)]
*  It's targeted at Jewish students, Jewish individuals. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=562.34s)]
*  Do you understand your testimony is dehumanizing them? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=566.42s)]
*  OK, so if you accept that, I know a lot of you do. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=569.38s)]
*  I've seen a lot of people cheering this congresswoman expressing hatred for these presidents. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=572.82s)]
*  As I said, the University of Pennsylvania professor is about to be fired. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=578.54s)]
*  Then what you're essentially saying is that you think that speech alone can constitute [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=585.62s)]
*  harassment, that it can dehumanize. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=591.9s)]
*  So if a DeliWire writer goes onto a college campus and says, I believe the society should [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=595.74s)]
*  eradicate transgenderism, obviously a trans person can stand up and say, this is dehumanizing. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=604.1800000000001s)]
*  This is genocidal. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=611.1s)]
*  And they say, well, I'm not saying I want to kill all trans people. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=612.1s)]
*  I'm just saying transgenderism should be eradicated. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=616.38s)]
*  But no one here is saying kill all Jews or gas the Jews. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=620.46s)]
*  They're saying, I believe in an uprising of the Palestinian people or whatever opinions [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=625.26s)]
*  they're expressing that's being conflated into genocide in order to censor criticism [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=629.4200000000001s)]
*  of Israel in the United States. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=634.1s)]
*  Here is Bill Ackman, a billionaire hedge fund manager who has led the way in cancel culture [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=637.7s)]
*  and censorship for critics of Israel. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=644.7s)]
*  He was the one who first circulated or called for the circulation of the list of the names [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=646.7s)]
*  of the students who signed the pro-Palestinian anti-Israel statement early on to put them [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=650.94s)]
*  on blacklists until they'll never be hired. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=656.5s)]
*  He's been throwing his billionaire status around. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=659.38s)]
*  And now he basically is calling for, well, he's saying this reflects the grave moral [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=662.26s)]
*  bankruptcy of these presidents. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=668.46s)]
*  And he's accusing them of endorsing the speech designed to kill Jews. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=674.74s)]
*  But I ask again, who's saying this? [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=681.74s)]
*  Who's saying that they should kill all Jews? [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=683.46s)]
*  Here is the University of Penn president, Liz McGill, who today issued what really looked [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=688.3s)]
*  like a hostage video, apologizing for her defense of free speech, for saying, once it [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=699.28s)]
*  turns into conduct, we can punish it, but not just pure speech. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=705.9200000000001s)]
*  Listen to what they forced her to read, meaning they, the team of lawyers and donor managers [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=708.84s)]
*  and PR consultants and crisis management consultants, listen to what they had her say. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=715.9200000000001s)]
*  There was a moment during yesterday's congressional hearing on anti-Semitism when I was asked [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=721.6800000000001s)]
*  if a call for the genocide of Jewish people on our campus would violate our policies. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=726.96s)]
*  In that moment, I was focused on our university's longstanding policies aligned with the U.S. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=735.44s)]
*  Constitution, which say that speech alone is not punishable. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=742.44s)]
*  I was not focused on, but I should have been. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=748.2s)]
*  The irrefutable fact that a call for genocide of Jewish people is a call for some of the [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=751.88s)]
*  most terrible violence human beings can perpetrate. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=757.52s)]
*  It's okay. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=762.24s)]
*  So she basically got successfully coerced into withdrawing what was definitely her controversial, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=763.24s)]
*  but also important defense of free speech, but it's not going to save her job. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=770.92s)]
*  There are too many powerful people demanding that she be fired and that the university [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=776.12s)]
*  not allow this speech to take place. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=779.36s)]
*  That's what they've been doing from the start. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=781.0s)]
*  It's not easy to get a university professor fired. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=785.2s)]
*  You see which issue is the one that will get them fired. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=788.6s)]
*  Now fire.org, which is the only principled free speech defense organization in the United [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=791.24s)]
*  States now that the ACLU has turned almost entirely partisan, you may recall that they [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=799.28s)]
*  Governor DeSantis for banning a pro-Palestinian student group in the University of Florida [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=805.28s)]
*  system as a grave attack on the First Amendment. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=810.1600000000001s)]
*  They became so popular among conservatives because they spent years defending conservative [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=814.44s)]
*  students' free speech rights on campuses when nobody else would. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=818.8000000000001s)]
*  The problem with fire.org in the eyes of some people is they actually believe in free speech. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=823.32s)]
*  They apply it to everybody, not just to the people they like and agree with. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=829.0400000000001s)]
*  So here is what fire.org said about all this. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=834.32s)]
*  Tonight Penn's president, Liz McGill, signaled that one of our nation's most prestigious [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=837.12s)]
*  institutions is willing to abandon its commitment to freedom of expression. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=843.08s)]
*  Were Penn to retreat from the robust protection of expressive rights, university administrators [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=848.2800000000001s)]
*  would make inevitably political decisions about who may speak and what may be said on [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=852.36s)]
*  campus. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=856.48s)]
*  Such a result would undoubtedly compromise the knowledge-generating process free expression [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=857.48s)]
*  and for which universities exist. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=863.9599999999999s)]
*  To be clear, universities will not enforce a rule against quote calls for genocide in [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=867.56s)]
*  the way elected officials calling for President McGill's resignation think they will. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=871.64s)]
*  Dissenting an unpopular speech, whether pro-Israeli, pro-Palestinian, conservative, or liberal, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=876.52s)]
*  will be silenced. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=881.12s)]
*  The power to censor always invites abuse and never stays cabined. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=882.68s)]
*  That is the argument I've been making to left liberal censors for as long as I can remember. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=890.32s)]
*  That if you think you found a certain speech that you hate so much that you're ready to [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=899.12s)]
*  declare it over the line of what free speech allows and demand that people be punished [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=903.24s)]
*  or prevented from saying it, don't be surprised when your advocacy for censorship gets turned [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=908.04s)]
*  against you and you start to be even more than you were before the victim of censorship. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=915.8s)]
*  We hope to see you there. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv3Nrc9kTu0&t=945.8s)]
