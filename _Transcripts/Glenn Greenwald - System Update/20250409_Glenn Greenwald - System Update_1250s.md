# Supreme Court Deportations Ruling: A Trump Win?
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [April 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I)
*  It's one thing to deport somebody back to their home country. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=0.0s)]
*  It's an entirely different matter to throw somebody into an El Salvadoran prison for [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=11.5s)]
*  life. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=15.9s)]
*  And if you are in the position like, I don't care, I'm more than willing to see completely [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=16.9s)]
*  innocent people. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=23.46s)]
*  Not just innocent in the sense that they all figured it was across the border illegally, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=26.5s)]
*  which I don't think that merits life in prison in El Salvador, but maybe you do. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=31.060000000000002s)]
*  But innocent people, people who entered the United States the right way, who sought legal [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=38.26s)]
*  asylum in a legal port of entry, clearly fleeing persecution. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=43.36s)]
*  And you're going to say, I don't care if those innocent people spend life in prison in a [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=49.5s)]
*  dungeon in El Salvador. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=56.059999999999995s)]
*  I'm sorry, but that is a failure of humanity. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=57.26s)]
*  It's almost sociopathic not to care about that. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=60.26s)]
*  That's the question that was brought to the Supreme Court. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=63.54s)]
*  The government appealed the restraining order, the injunction issued by Judge Boasberg, and [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=66.82s)]
*  the court issued its ruling yesterday. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=73.25999999999999s)]
*  There you see the caption, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States, versus J.G.G., [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=74.97999999999999s)]
*  which is one of the people who were going to be deported with no due process, and the [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=81.94000000000001s)]
*  government applied to vacate the injunction issued by Boasberg. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=89.30000000000001s)]
*  So let me just explain something. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=95.74000000000001s)]
*  This has been reported as a huge victory for Donald Trump. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=98.34s)]
*  Conservatives were celebrating, oh, the Supreme Court ruled that Trump's deportations can [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=101.42s)]
*  go ahead, they're all legal. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=105.42s)]
*  That's not remotely what happened. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=106.66000000000001s)]
*  It was a five to four ruling. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=111.5s)]
*  In dissent were the three liberal judges, Kagan, Sotomayor, and Judge Jackson, and they were [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=114.62s)]
*  joined by Amy Coney Barrett, a Trump-supported judge, a Trump-appointed judge. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=124.46000000000001s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=131.22s)]
*  The majority said, we're vacating the injunction simply for procedural reasons. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=132.22s)]
*  The ACLU sued in Washington, in Washington, D.C., that's where Judge Boasberg is, on the [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=139.26s)]
*  grounds that that's where the United States is, so that's where you're suing because you're [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=145.54s)]
*  suing the United States. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=149.02s)]
*  And the five justices on the Supreme Court said, no, that's the wrong place to sue. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=150.94s)]
*  The only place you can bring a habeas corpus here in, which is a judicial proceeding to [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=157.18s)]
*  say that you've been wrongfully imprisoned, is in the place where you're being detained. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=161.62s)]
*  You can't bring it in Washington, D.C. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=167.7s)]
*  If you're detained in Texas, you have to bring it in Texas. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=169.01999999999998s)]
*  And so they basically said, this was brought in the wrong court, so we're taking it away [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=173.22s)]
*  from Judge Boasberg, which obviously conservatives were happy about. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=176.14s)]
*  They demonized Judge Boasberg, even though I'm just telling you, he's a very ordinary [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=179.26s)]
*  judge. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=184.38s)]
*  There are left-wing judges in the federal judiciary, not many, but some, I mean real [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=185.38s)]
*  left-wing. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=188.73999999999998s)]
*  Like if you think Bill Clinton and Chuck Schumer are left-wing, then yes, Judge Boasberg [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=189.73999999999998s)]
*  is left-wing. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=193.7s)]
*  But the actual left, people who work for legal aid or NGOs or left-wing activists, there [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=194.7s)]
*  are very few of those who get through the Senate. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=201.78s)]
*  They're mostly corporate lawyers and prosecutors, even who the Democratic presidents select. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=204.73999999999998s)]
*  But in any event, they took it away from Judge Boasberg, and what they said was, every time [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=209.22s)]
*  there's a detainee who's about to be deported, they have the right to sue the U.S. government [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=214.23999999999998s)]
*  and ask for a habeas corpus hearing in a federal court to require the government to present [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=221.42s)]
*  evidence of their guilt and for them to disprove the accusations. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=226.82s)]
*  Now note, this is not for every deportation. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=229.57999999999998s)]
*  Deportations can continue as they always have. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=234.38s)]
*  You just go to that DOJ court, that deportation court, all you have to prove is they're here [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=236.26s)]
*  illegally. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=240.85999999999999s)]
*  You don't have to prove they committed any crime, they're bad people, nothing. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=241.85999999999999s)]
*  Just that they entered illegally, they don't have legal authorization to stay in the U.S., [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=243.5s)]
*  the deportation court authorizes the deportation and you send them back to their country of [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=246.38s)]
*  origin. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=250.5s)]
*  This only applies to the invocation of the Alien Enemies Act, which grants Trump immense [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=252.3s)]
*  power. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=257.22s)]
*  And they believe, the government believes that once that is invoked, Trump can send [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=259.58s)]
*  them anywhere, even to an El Salvador prison, and doesn't have to give them a hearing to [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=263.62s)]
*  contest the accusations against them, doesn't have to give this gay makeup artist an opportunity [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=268.76s)]
*  to go into court and say, I'm not a member of Trendy Aragon, I'm a gay makeup artist, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=274.78s)]
*  they've misinterpreted my tattoos here, you can see them, I'll tell you exactly what they [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=278.26s)]
*  are. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=281.53999999999996s)]
*  And there probably are some judges who won't care, they'll just say, Trump administration [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=282.53999999999996s)]
*  can do whatever they want, but most human beings would not easily consign people to [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=286.65999999999997s)]
*  life imprisonment if they're innocent. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=292.14s)]
*  So it's at least an opportunity for them to prove it, let the public hear as well. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=297.42s)]
*  And all nine justices of the Supreme Court, all nine of them, not just Sotomayor and Kagan [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=302.42s)]
*  and Brown Jackson, or even Amy Coney Barrett, but Judge Alito, Justice Alito, Justice Thomas, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=309.78000000000003s)]
*  Justice Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, John Roberts, all of them together, all nine unanimously [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=315.90000000000003s)]
*  said, we agree that the United States government cannot deport people under the Alien Enemies [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=324.22s)]
*  Act unless you first give them an opportunity, notice and an opportunity to go into court [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=333.42s)]
*  and contest the accusations against them. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=338.22s)]
*  It's a victory for due process, it's not a pure victory for Donald Trump and his program [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=341.02000000000004s)]
*  at all. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=344.42s)]
*  Here's the text, quote, the application to vacate the orders of the United States District [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=346.46000000000004s)]
*  Court for the District of Columbia presented to the Chief Justice and by him referred to [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=349.92s)]
*  the court is granted. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=353.94s)]
*  So they're dissolving the injunction. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=355.86s)]
*  The March 15th minute orders granting a temporary restraining order in March 28th, 2025 extension [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=359.18s)]
*  by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia are vacated. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=364.7s)]
*  So that's the victory. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=368.6s)]
*  No more nationwide injunction. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=370.44s)]
*  But this is what the majority said, the five conservative justices joined by an agreement [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=375.26s)]
*  before dissenters as well. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=381.94s)]
*  Listen to this. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=384.02s)]
*  The detainees also sought equitable relief against summary removal. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=385.02s)]
*  Although judicial review under the Alien Enemies Act is limited, we have held that an individual [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=390.58s)]
*  subject to detention and removal under that statute is entitled to, quote, judicial review [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=396.9s)]
*  both as to questions of interpretation and constitutionality of the act as well as he [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=403.5s)]
*  or she is in fact an alien enemy 14 years of age or older. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=409.02000000000004s)]
*  So you can do two things here. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=414.18s)]
*  You can go into court and you can say it's unconstitutional to invoke the Alien Enemies [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=416.18s)]
*  Act. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=419.58000000000004s)]
*  It's legally invalid. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=420.58000000000004s)]
*  We're not at war. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=421.78000000000003s)]
*  That's not a statute that can be invoked. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=423.38s)]
*  But you can also say, I'm not an alien enemy. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=427.22s)]
*  I don't belong to a drug gang. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=429.34000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I'm in the United States. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=430.58000000000004s)]
*  I saw an asylum here or even maybe I entered the border illegally, but I'm not a member [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=432.62s)]
*  of a drug gang. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=435.54s)]
*  The only evidence they have, make them show the evidence. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=436.66s)]
*  Oh, the tattoos? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=438.26000000000005s)]
*  No, this is an autism tattoo. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=439.26000000000005s)]
*  All nine members of the Supreme Court said they had that due process, right? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=442.42s)]
*  They go on, the majority. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=444.62s)]
*  AEA detainees must receive notice after the date of disorder that they are subject to [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=445.62s)]
*  removal from the United States under the act. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=452.38s)]
*  The notice must be afforded within a reasonable time and in such a manner as will allow them [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=455.66s)]
*  to actually seek habeas relief in the proper venue before such removal occurs. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=461.06s)]
*  The reason I'm emphasizing that all nine justices of the Supreme Court said that is because [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=468.58s)]
*  I can't tell you how many times I've heard since this all started, this whole controversy. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=471.22s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=476.1s)]
*  I've heard so many times. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=477.1s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=478.1s)]
*  These are people in the United States. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=479.1s)]
*  These aren't citizens. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=480.58s)]
*  These are people who are non-Americans. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=481.58s)]
*  People who might even be illegal. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=485.74s)]
*  They don't have the right of due process. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=486.74s)]
*  I kept saying for 150 years the Supreme Court has held otherwise. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=488.21999999999997s)]
*  Due process is not a present given by the Bill of Rights to this special group called [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=493.02s)]
*  American citizens. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=498.06s)]
*  It's intended to be a restraint on the US government with respect to anyone, citizen [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=499.06s)]
*  or not, under the control of the US government. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=503.97999999999996s)]
*  And if that weren't the case, if non-citizens didn't have the rights, then Joe Biden could [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=506.46s)]
*  have sent Jordan Peterson to prison for life with no trial for saying, oh, he's jeopardizing [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=512.74s)]
*  national security by criticizing my policies. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=519.0600000000001s)]
*  Do you think conservatives would say, oh yeah, that's constitutional. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=521.1s)]
*  Jordan Peterson is not an American. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=523.82s)]
*  He's on US soil, but he has no constitutional rights. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=526.58s)]
*  Biden can imprison him for life just for, of course not. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=529.14s)]
*  Courts would instantly say that Jordan Peterson's first-member rights were violated, which he [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=532.3s)]
*  has even though he's a non-citizen. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=537.1s)]
*  And it's been true forever of people who aren't even in the country legally. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=540.18s)]
*  As all nine justices said, they all have due process rights, which have been violated, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=544.18s)]
*  the people who were sent to El Salvador. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=548.34s)]
*  Here's Justice Kavanaugh writing separately from the majority who wrote to say this, quote, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=551.34s)]
*  I agree with the court's per curiam opinion, which is when an opinion issued on behalf [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=556.86s)]
*  of the whole court that becomes binding. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=561.5s)]
*  He says, importantly, as the court stresses, the court's disagreement with the four dissenters [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=565.06s)]
*  is not over whether the detainees receive judicial review of their transfers. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=571.3399999999999s)]
*  All nine members of the court agree that judicial review is available. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=575.9399999999999s)]
*  The only question in dispute is where that judicial review should occur, namely in Washington, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=580.02s)]
*  DC or in the place that they're being detained. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=585.14s)]
*  Here's Justice Sotomayor writing for the dissenters, including Kagan and Jackson, and Amy Coney [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=590.7s)]
*  Barrett joined parts of this opinion. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=595.4200000000001s)]
*  And this is what she writes, critically, even the majority today agrees. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=600.4200000000001s)]
*  And the federal government now admits that individuals subject to removal under the Alien [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=604.9000000000001s)]
*  Enemies Act are entitled to adequate notice and judicial review before they can be removed. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=609.84s)]
*  Begin with that upon which all nine members of the court agree. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=616.38s)]
*  The court's order today dictates in no uncertain terms that, quote, individuals subject to [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=619.86s)]
*  detention or removal under the Alien Enemies Act are entitled to, quote, judicial review [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=625.18s)]
*  as to questions of interpretation and constitutionality of the act, as well as whether he or she is [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=629.54s)]
*  in fact an alien enemy 14 years of age or older. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=635.54s)]
*  That means, of course, that the government cannot usher any detainees, including plaintiffs, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=638.36s)]
*  onto planes in a shroud of secrecy as it did on March 15th, nor can the government, quote, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=643.9s)]
*  immediately resume removing individuals without notice upon vacating the restraining order [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=648.58s)]
*  as it promised the DC court it would do. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=654.6600000000001s)]
*  So there's a court order from the Supreme Court, all nine justices of the Supreme Court, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=658.46s)]
*  saying what you did on March 15th in smuggling these people out in secret, no notice that [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=662.34s)]
*  they were going to be removed, no opportunity to go into court, all nine justices say that's [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=667.86s)]
*  unconstitutional and you cannot do that again. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=671.1800000000001s)]
*  That is not a full victory for the Trump administration, not at all. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=673.74s)]
*  It's a victory for due process, for the Constitution, and it should forever bury this idea that [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=677.68s)]
*  non-citizens don't have constitutional rights in the United States. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=682.4s)]
*  The Supreme Court has always ruled otherwise they just did again, unanimously, from Justice [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=684.6s)]
*  Thomas in Milito to Kagan and Sotomayor, everybody in between. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=688.68s)]
*  That's not the only thing a court did. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=692.64s)]
*  The United States Court of Appeals, which was an appeal from a ruling from a district [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=696.28s)]
*  court that one of the people sent to El Salvador in particular, Kilmar Armando Abrigo Garcia, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=705.24s)]
*  was even by the US government's account mistakenly sent there because there was a deportation [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=713.8s)]
*  hold on him. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=720.72s)]
*  He was not permitted by a prior court, a deportation court, to be removed. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=721.8s)]
*  He's lived in the United States for a long time, he's never been charged with a crime, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=726.5600000000001s)]
*  he's married to an American citizen, they have an American child together that they're [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=728.92s)]
*  raising. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=731.5600000000001s)]
*  The only evidence that he was a member of a gang was that some informant claimed it, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=734.12s)]
*  there's no evidence of it, so a court put a deportation hold on him. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=737.4s)]
*  The US government ignored that order, sent him to El Salvador anyway, where he's now [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=740.8s)]
*  wasting away in that same prison, and a district court judge said, you have to get him back. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=744.92s)]
*  You sent him there unjustly, illegally, and in violation of a court order, you have to [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=750.36s)]
*  get him back from El Salvador. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=754.32s)]
*  The Trump administration's position was, what do you mean? [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=755.72s)]
*  We can't control what El Salvador does, which of course is a joke. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=759.24s)]
*  President Bukele's whole strategy as a country is to make himself and his country as subservient [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=763.64s)]
*  as possible to the United States and Trump. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=769.72s)]
*  He does whatever Trump tells him to do, that's his whole nationwide strategy. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=771.66s)]
*  Beyond that, the US is paying El Salvador to keep him in that prison. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=776.3199999999999s)]
*  So you just say, we're not going to pay you, we want him back, we sent you him back. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=781.06s)]
*  Mistakenly, of course El Salvador is going to get him back. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=784.68s)]
*  So the US government appealed that order from a district court judge and a federal [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=790.08s)]
*  appeals court, three judges, one of whom is an appointee by Ronald Reagan. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=793.8000000000001s)]
*  All three ruled that that was a just order, that you cannot send people to El Salvador [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=799.64s)]
*  and El Salvador in prison when there's a deportation hold on them. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=807.32s)]
*  And this is what two of the judges concurring in the opinion wrote, quote, the panel unanimously [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=810.76s)]
*  agrees that the district court's order requiring the government, quote, to facilitate and [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=816.68s)]
*  effectuate the return of Plaintiff Kilmer Armando Abrego Garcia to the United States [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=820.4s)]
*  by no later than 11.59 PM on Monday, April 7 should not be stayed. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=824.9799999999999s)]
*  The government's motion to say is therefore denied. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=831.3399999999999s)]
*  I'd like to explain my view. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=833.3199999999999s)]
*  The United States government has no legal authority to snatch a person who is lawfully [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=835.5999999999999s)]
*  present in the United States off the street and remove him from the country without due [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=839.2399999999999s)]
*  process. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=843.52s)]
*  The government's contention otherwise and its argument that federal courts are powerless [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=845.36s)]
*  to intervene are unconscionable. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=849.1600000000001s)]
*  I know there's this conservative idea among a lot of Trump supporters that federal courts [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=853.44s)]
*  have no role to play in saying when the president violates the Constitution. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=856.7600000000001s)]
*  What's the point of having a constitution if the president can just violate it whenever [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=861.24s)]
*  he wants and no other body can do anything about it, including courts? [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=863.84s)]
*  Since when does the United States operate that way? [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=868.6800000000001s)]
*  I go, yeah. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=870.4000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, the bill it writes, but the president just ignores it and violates it. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=871.9599999999999s)]
*  He puts people in prison because of their speech or sends people to prison with no due [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=875.3199999999999s)]
*  process. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=882.3199999999999s)]
*  Courts have no business interfering. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=883.48s)]
*  Who does that? [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=886.0799999999999s)]
*  What happens if the president violates the Constitution? [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=887.0799999999999s)]
*  Who do you go to if you've been unconstitutionally punished by the government? [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=889.3199999999999s)]
*  Who do you go to to ask to rule on that? [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=894.04s)]
*  It's always been the courts. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=897.12s)]
*  Again, conservatives ran into the courts all the time to ask courts to enjoin a rule against [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=900.1600000000001s)]
*  the Democratic presidents. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=904.8000000000001s)]
*  It's been going on for decades. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=905.8000000000001s)]
*  Just today, I'll give you an example, because there's this claim that only left-wing judges [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=909.2800000000001s)]
*  are doing this when in reality these injunctions have been across the board ideologically from [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=914.5600000000001s)]
*  Republican presidents, from Democratic presidents. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=918.0s)]
*  Just today, as you might recall last month or six weeks ago, the Trump administration [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=920.5600000000001s)]
*  ordered media outlets to refer to what had been the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=925.64s)]
*  It was a major priority for Donald Trump, and we call this the Gulf of America. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=929.8399999999999s)]
*  Associated Press didn't comply. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=934.92s)]
*  They kept referring to it as the Gulf of Mexico. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=936.4799999999999s)]
*  Trump was enraged, and he decided to punish AP by removing and stripping them from all [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=940.4s)]
*  access to cover the president, the White House, the president's plane. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=946.52s)]
*  Earlier today, this afternoon, a Trump-appointed federal district judge, a Trump-appointed [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=953.96s)]
*  district judge, appointed by Donald Trump, ruled that if you punish a media outlet because [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=958.84s)]
*  of their refusal to adopt government speech, you obviously violate the First Amendment, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=965.76s)]
*  the right of the free press, the right of free speech. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=972.76s)]
*  These are Trump-appointed judges. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=975.6s)]
*  Amy Coney Barrett is a Trump-appointed judge. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=980.0799999999999s)]
*  So is Neil Gorsuch. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=983.92s)]
*  And you have them saying, these detainees have the right of due process before they [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=988.56s)]
*  can be removed. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=994.04s)]
*  So I think this is critical to realize. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=999.28s)]
*  I understand completely that mass immigration is a problem that most people in the country [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=1003.56s)]
*  agree needs to be addressed. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=1011.4399999999999s)]
*  Trump ran on it. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=1015.28s)]
*  He has every right to do that. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=1016.28s)]
*  A lot of Democrats also say they support that. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=1017.28s)]
*  It's obviously the Democratic will. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=1021.64s)]
*  But above all elected leaders is the Constitution. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=1023.4399999999999s)]
*  It's the governing document of the United States. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=1028.72s)]
*  The purpose of the Bill of Rights in particular is to limit what majorities can do, to limit [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=1030.72s)]
*  what elected officials can do. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=1037.6000000000001s)]
*  It puts limits on how they can exercise their power. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=1039.5600000000002s)]
*  You have a majority, 90% of Americans, who say they want to imprison anyone who practices [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=1043.48s)]
*  this specific religion or who doesn't have a religion or who are atheists. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=1048.68s)]
*  90% say imprison them, banish them. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=1052.8s)]
*  Their religion is evil. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=1055.3200000000002s)]
*  But you have a clause in the Constitution that guarantees freedom of religion, free [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=1057.76s)]
*  exercise of religion. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=1061.08s)]
*  And so even if 90% of the country wants it, even if everyone in Congress or the president [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=1063.8s)]
*  wants it, you still can't do it. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=1068.8s)]
*  That's the point of the Bill of Rights. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=1071.2s)]
*  It limits majoritarian power. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=1072.2s)]
*  It's an anti-majoritarian document. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=1074.12s)]
*  Because the founders were actually afraid of majoritarian mobs. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=1076.64s)]
*  These were very wealthy landowners. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=1081.48s)]
*  They were afraid the majorities would get together and take their land, just seize it. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=1082.76s)]
*  That's why they put into the Constitution that you cannot deprive somebody of property [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=1087.68s)]
*  without due process of law or life or liberty. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=1091.8600000000001s)]
*  Because they feared majoritarian mobs. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=1095.52s)]
*  They created a democracy, but not one without limits. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=1097.4s)]
*  The Constitution imposes limits. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=1102.54s)]
*  And no matter how much you want a government to succeed in a goal, you have to respect [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=1105.8s)]
*  the limits. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=1113.44s)]
*  As much as you might want that, the government still can't authorize the police to break [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=1115.04s)]
*  into your house and go house to house into houses with no warrants, even if that would [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=1121.64s)]
*  help their cause of catching criminals, because the Bill of Rights says they can't do that. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=1127.22s)]
*  They can't go into anyone's house without a warrant. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=1131.0s)]
*  It's a limit on police power, on government power. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=1133.16s)]
*  Even though it may help criminals get away, it's a liberty that we guaranteed with the [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=1135.8s)]
*  Bill of Rights and that we should all support. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=1139.92s)]
*  Same thing with privacy rights. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=1142.24s)]
*  Rights of not being searched or surveilled without a warrant as well in the Fourth Amendment. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=1144.44s)]
*  These are foundational rights that define what the United States is. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=1151.3600000000001s)]
*  Nationalists always say, oh, America's not just a landmass, it's not just a country attached [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=1154.92s)]
*  to a bank or a shopping mall. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=1161.8400000000001s)]
*  It has certain values, certain traditions. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=1162.8400000000001s)]
*  These are the traditions. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=1166.3600000000001s)]
*  These are the founding of the United States, its identity. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=1167.3600000000001s)]
*  And if you're willing to authorize any politician, including the president, to just run roughshod [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=1171.12s)]
*  over the Bill of Rights, including as interpreted by the Supreme Court that includes three of [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=1178.1999999999998s)]
*  his own appointees, then you don't really believe in America at all. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=1185.8s)]
*  You might say you do, but if you don't care about the Bill of Rights, if you think the [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=1193.3999999999999s)]
*  president has the right to ignore it or transgress it, I don't see how you can say you believe [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=1198.96s)]
*  in American values at all. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=1204.68s)]
*  Unfortunately, there are judges, including ones who get appointed by a president, but [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=1205.68s)]
*  nonetheless stay faithful to the principles that they're supposed to uphold rather than [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=1210.68s)]
*  the individual or the party, who are increasingly affirming that as well. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=1214.48s)]
*  And I think it's very important for the balance of power in our system. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F19nHbtC0I&t=1219.88s)]
