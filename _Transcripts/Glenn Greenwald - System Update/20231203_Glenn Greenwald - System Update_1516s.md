# Glenn Greenwald & Max Abrahms Debate Israel-Gaza, Free Speech, & More
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [December 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y)
*  Max Abrams is an associate professor of political science at Northeastern University where he's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=0.0s)]
*  an expert in international security, especially in the areas of terrorism, US foreign policy, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=11.24s)]
*  great power competition, and international relations of the Middle East. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=17.2s)]
*  He's held fellowship and other research positions with all kinds of different academic institutions, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  including the Center for International Security and Cooperation at Stanford, the Dickey Center [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=26.84s)]
*  for International Understanding at Dartmouth, the Moshe Dayan Center at Tel Aviv University, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=30.759999999999998s)]
*  the Human Security Center in London, and think tanks including the Center on Foreign Relations. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=35.64s)]
*  He has been on our show before to talk about the war in Ukraine. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=40.84s)]
*  He's going to be here tonight to talk about our very different views on the Israeli war [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=43.44s)]
*  in Gaza and US policy toward it. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  Max, so great to see you. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=50.04s)]
*  Thanks so much for taking the time to talk to us. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=52.2s)]
*  We're very happy to have you. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=53.8s)]
*  I'm delighted to be here. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=56.84s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=58.120000000000005s)]
*  And I actually really do appreciate that introduction because in the tweets you were just saying, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=59.120000000000005s)]
*  you know, Israel supporter or whatever. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=64.68s)]
*  And I was going to call you out on it because I don't actually think that that does a good [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=67.04s)]
*  job of representing my views. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  It almost seems to imply that, you know, I'm consistently a pro-Israel person almost reflexively, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=75.60000000000001s)]
*  whereas that's really not true. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=84.04s)]
*  If you look at my foreign policy record over, say, the past 10, 12 years on many of the [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=86.04s)]
*  most important foreign policy debates involving the United States, I haven't had a pro-Israel [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=92.36000000000001s)]
*  view. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=98.56s)]
*  That's true with respect to my position in Syria, where I opposed helping the rebels. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=100.12s)]
*  I opposed the bombing campaign in Yemen, right? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=106.92s)]
*  I've been very critical about the intervention in Libya. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=112.12s)]
*  I don't think being sort of pro-Israel is very predictive of my foreign policy views. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=117.08s)]
*  Max, just to be clear, as you well know, Twitter has extreme space constraints. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=124.4s)]
*  I had to talk not only about our interview, but also about the other topic that we just [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=131.8s)]
*  covered. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=135.8s)]
*  I should note as well that you also published your own tweet about your appearance tonight [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=136.8s)]
*  and you said Glenn is a critic of Israel and an ardent supporter of the Palestinian cause, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=141.4s)]
*  which I think isn't quite as nuanced either, but I understood it's just kind of shorthand [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=146.60000000000002s)]
*  for indicating my position on this war. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=150.72s)]
*  All I meant with that was that you in this particular war that we're here to talk about [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=152.56s)]
*  support the Israeli war in Gaza. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=157.56s)]
*  That's all I meant by it. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=159.28s)]
*  As you said, when I had the space and time, I gave your full credentials. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=160.28s)]
*  That's I think just understanding that Twitter's space constraints are what they are. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=164.16000000000003s)]
*  It was just an attempt to kind of signify that we have different views on this particular [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=168.56s)]
*  question, not to impugn your worldview in any way. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=171.72s)]
*  So let me start with the area of agreement that we actually had and still have, which [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=175.76000000000002s)]
*  we talked about before, which is that you were, as I am and was, an opponent of the [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=182.0s)]
*  US funding of the Ukraine's war. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=187.84s)]
*  Over the last almost two years now, I've interviewed a lot of people who share our view, members [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=190.36s)]
*  of Congress and journalists and scholars, and most of them said, look, the United States [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=194.84s)]
*  has so many problems at home that we cannot go around funding foreign countries' wars. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=199.4s)]
*  It's just not something that we should be doing. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=205.52s)]
*  It's not something that we can be doing. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=207.28s)]
*  That was at least in part one of my reasons for opposing the US funding of the war in [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=208.68s)]
*  Ukraine along with others. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=212.6s)]
*  In the case of the war in Gaza, Joe Biden just requested $14 billion for Israel on top [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=214.48000000000002s)]
*  of the yearly $4 billion or so in various kinds of aid that they get. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=219.9s)]
*  In addition to $60 billion more for the war in Ukraine. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=224.44s)]
*  What is the difference between the two? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=228.52s)]
*  And I guess another way to ask that is, why should the US government be funding Israel's [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=231.68s)]
*  wars in the billions of dollars, seemingly without limits? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=236.4s)]
*  Yeah, the Biden administration also confounded these issues. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=240.48s)]
*  When he hit up the American public, he said, we need to give to Ukraine and we need to [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=246.07999999999998s)]
*  give to Israel. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=250.16s)]
*  I view these conflicts as extraordinarily different. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=252.12s)]
*  I don't see much of a synergy there at all. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=255.96s)]
*  My North Star, in terms of my foreign policy positions, hasn't been so much, you know, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=260.28000000000003s)]
*  or at all to reflexively support Israel, but to never be on the side of the terrorists, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=266.28000000000003s)]
*  to not be on the side of al-Qaeda. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=274.34000000000003s)]
*  That was true in Syria. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=277.90000000000003s)]
*  That was true in Yemen. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=279.32s)]
*  That's true also in this case with Operation Al-Aqsa Flood. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=280.96s)]
*  Operation Al-Aqsa Flood is not sort of just an independent terrorist conflict that's far [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=287.23999999999995s)]
*  away. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=292.88s)]
*  Every single branch of al-Qaeda is cheering it on. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=293.96s)]
*  The German intelligence just two days ago said that traditional barriers between Hamas, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=299.08s)]
*  al-Qaeda, and Islamic State, they have differences ideologically. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=304.96s)]
*  But actually, this Islamist threat has merged. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=309.68s)]
*  Hamas has emerged as a leading actor in the global jihad. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=313.04s)]
*  If I have a bias, it's not for Israel, but it's against terrorists. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=318.16s)]
*  The – so just to be clear, one of the arguments for Ukraine was the reason we have to make [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=323.48s)]
*  sure Ukraine wins and that Russia loses is because a win for Russia is a win for China. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=328.68s)]
*  There's all these other groups, countries like Iran, that hate us and that are also [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=335.66s)]
*  cheering for Russia to win. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=340.38000000000005s)]
*  And so the argument was we have to get involved. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=342.5s)]
*  It sounds a lot like that's your rationale here, not that Hamas can attack the United [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=345.54s)]
*  States, but there's all these groups that we hate that hate us and are cheering for [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=349.34000000000003s)]
*  Israel to lose and therefore we should have to make – we should intervene and ensure [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=355.42s)]
*  that Israel wins. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=360.22s)]
*  It sounds like that rationale for Ukraine and Israel there is the same, so why does [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=361.98s)]
*  it convince you in the case of – in Israel to get involved with U.S. funding but not [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=366.02000000000004s)]
*  in the case of Ukraine? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=370.98s)]
*  It's hard for me to remember a case where China actually attacked the U.S. homeland [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=372.62s)]
*  in large numbers. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=380.3s)]
*  I don't think it's crazy at all to think that al-Qaeda would do so. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=381.3s)]
*  In fact, all you need to do is go to some of these big Palestine rallies, which have [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=385.74s)]
*  gotten completely out of control. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=390.66s)]
*  They are full of anti-Semitism and violence. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=393.26s)]
*  And you can see people openly calling for a caliphate. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=396.78000000000003s)]
*  They are waving flags, Glenn, of terrorist groups that are designated by the U.S. State [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=401.14s)]
*  Department as foreign terrorist organizations, flags of terrorist organizations that actually [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=408.06s)]
*  have a history of attacking the United States. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=414.02s)]
*  So just this week, you know, we see PFLP flags, right, Popular Front for the Liberation of [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=417.94s)]
*  Palestine. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=423.82s)]
*  These are groups that are not limited in their target selection to Israel. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=424.82s)]
*  They hijacked a plane coming out of Los Angeles. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=428.82s)]
*  And essentially they were the precursors to al-Qaeda, and that was sort of the model of [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=432.06s)]
*  the 9-11 attacks. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=437.82s)]
*  So I think that the danger to Americans is much more real, and it's certainly not distant. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=439.54s)]
*  But the $14 billion that Joe Biden is asking Congress to authorize isn't going to be used [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=446.42s)]
*  to round up these bad protesters who you say are being violent, who are waving flags of [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=453.26s)]
*  terrorist organizations in the United States or the West. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=458.92s)]
*  The $14 billion is going to be used to give Israel bombs, to drop on Gaza, to give them [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=463.74s)]
*  more weapons, to attack people in the West Bank. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=470.42s)]
*  So why, if the United States has all these problems at home, as you say, with all these [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=475.1s)]
*  protesters who are being violent and who are pro-terrorists, isn't that all the more reason [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=481.18s)]
*  why the United States should focus inward and use its resources on American security [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=485.26000000000005s)]
*  rather than transferring $16 billion to Israel to pay or $14 billion to pay for the Israeli [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=489.78000000000003s)]
*  war? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=495.54s)]
*  I find it extraordinarily hard to believe that that sort of sum to help Israel with [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=497.78000000000003s)]
*  its counterterrorism would in any way meaningfully undermine U.S. security in terms of our material [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=503.02000000000004s)]
*  investments at home. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=510.66s)]
*  I do think that it's in the U.S. interest for terrorists like Hamas to be punished and [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=513.1s)]
*  to be degraded. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=520.54s)]
*  Again, Hamas has been, it wasn't before, but it has emerged as a very important actor in [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=522.1s)]
*  the global jihad. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=530.1800000000001s)]
*  Even not looking at Hamas, just looking at Al-Qaeda and ISIS, U.S. intelligence services [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=533.46s)]
*  throughout the West, not just in the United States, but throughout Europe, are saying, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=540.86s)]
*  you know what? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=545.46s)]
*  These organizations have had a resurgence since October 7th, and that is not good for [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=546.74s)]
*  U.S. national security. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=554.22s)]
*  What do you think should be done to the people who are protesting? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=556.26s)]
*  Protesting, obviously if you use violence, that's a crime, it's already a crime, but [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=559.54s)]
*  in terms of people who are protesting without using violence, and obviously there are a [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=564.18s)]
*  lot of them, there may be, we can fight about what percentage are using violence in these [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=567.66s)]
*  protests. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=572.86s)]
*  I think people can see the protest and make up their own minds, but in terms of the people [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=573.86s)]
*  who are just protesting nonviolently, but they're waving flags, I guess you mean Hamas [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=578.78s)]
*  flags or Al-Qaeda flags, I haven't seen that many, but let's assume there's a good number [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=584.62s)]
*  of them. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=588.46s)]
*  What do you think the United States government should do to those people who are protesting [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=590.4200000000001s)]
*  but not using violence? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=593.5s)]
*  That's a great question. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=596.9000000000001s)]
*  You know, there's been a lot of focus on the controversial slogan, from the river to the [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=597.9000000000001s)]
*  sea. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=603.62s)]
*  There's been a big backlash against that. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=604.62s)]
*  That is not actually as concerning to me, because from the river to the sea, although [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=608.4200000000001s)]
*  I don't love the slogan, is an expression of a political preference. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=616.46s)]
*  What's much more concerning is when you have people expressing approval and encouraging [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=623.74s)]
*  violent tactics. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=631.0600000000001s)]
*  The other really big slogans that you hear at all of these demonstrations is for there [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=633.22s)]
*  to be a global anti-fata, an anti-fata revolution. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=638.98s)]
*  In my mind, from a free speech perspective, that's a little bit more complicated, because [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=644.62s)]
*  there were two anti-fatas, technically. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=650.3399999999999s)]
*  Anti-fata one and anti-fata two, one in the late 80s and one after the Oslo period in [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=655.26s)]
*  the 1990s. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=661.26s)]
*  They both featured violence, and the second one especially was terrorist violence against [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=662.26s)]
*  civilians. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=668.98s)]
*  And so when you have large numbers of people calling for an anti-fata, that is concerning [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=670.4200000000001s)]
*  to me in a way that an expression of political preference is not. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=678.86s)]
*  I would certainly not crack down on people for having a different political preference, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=684.22s)]
*  but the constant expression and encouragement of violence is something that should be looked [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=690.38s)]
*  at. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=695.5s)]
*  We've seen at many of the counter protests, the pro-Israel protest, we've seen in the [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=697.74s)]
*  United States and the West, but also in Israel from Israeli officials, people who are saying [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=702.66s)]
*  things like, erase Gaza, erase Gaza from the map, flatten Gaza, turn Gaza into a parking [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=708.0600000000001s)]
*  lot, kill them all. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=715.22s)]
*  I've seen Israelis saying that. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=718.82s)]
*  I've seen Americans saying that. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=720.98s)]
*  I've seen Israeli officials saying that. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=723.1s)]
*  Is that, in your mind, something that also is concerning and that should be looked at, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=726.26s)]
*  or are those kinds of sentiments permissible? [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=729.9399999999999s)]
*  Well, you would never hear me say something like that. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=734.7399999999999s)]
*  No, of course not. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=736.9399999999999s)]
*  Of course not. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=737.9399999999999s)]
*  Of course not. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=738.9399999999999s)]
*  I'm not suggesting you would, but I'm saying... [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=739.9399999999999s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=740.9399999999999s)]
*  So I agree. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=741.9399999999999s)]
*  That is concerning. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=742.9399999999999s)]
*  It is concerning if somebody were to say, flatten Gaza, because that would entail the [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=743.9399999999999s)]
*  killing of large numbers of civilians. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=751.4599999999999s)]
*  The killing of civilians is always terrible, and it should never be expressed or advocated [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=756.66s)]
*  as a policy position. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=762.82s)]
*  How about things that Nikki Haley has said and Lizzie Graham has said, which is, I think [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=765.3000000000001s)]
*  we should go just start bombing Iran. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=771.7s)]
*  I want to drop bombs on Iran. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=774.0600000000001s)]
*  Let's say that there are people even kind of more hawkish than they, and they say, I [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=776.1800000000001s)]
*  think we should have a mass bombing campaign. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=779.62s)]
*  We should carpet bomb Iran. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=782.5s)]
*  Is this the sort of thing that also should maybe be legally looked into, or is that clearly [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=784.48s)]
*  legally permissible? [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=789.4000000000001s)]
*  Well, here's a little bit of a difference, Glenn. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=790.72s)]
*  What you have oftentimes is on campuses throughout the United States, you have large numbers [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=795.24s)]
*  of demonstrators who are screaming at Jewish students, and they are wearing masks deliberately, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=804.08s)]
*  and they are explicitly advertising on their flyers that the purpose of the masks is to [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=815.72s)]
*  impose costs and to intimidate, and that these students and these universities are, to quote [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=823.0400000000001s)]
*  them, complicit. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=833.36s)]
*  And so it's not as sort of remote as just saying, oh, our policy towards Iran, which [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=835.96s)]
*  is thousands and thousands of miles away, should be a very belligerent one. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=843.96s)]
*  The purpose of saying and screaming at the Jews at these universities that they're in [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=850.32s)]
*  favor of violence is to intimidate them. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=859.24s)]
*  And I don't know of any minority group at universities that are subject to this kind [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=864.44s)]
*  of abuse where you have the majority screaming at them that they want to use violence. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=870.64s)]
*  They want a global antifada, which is understood to mean violence against Jewish targets, which [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=877.24s)]
*  is not just some esoteric abstract concern. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=885.68s)]
*  It is actually happening. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=889.4s)]
*  And so I think that there's a real important difference between advocating in a very aggressive [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=891.4399999999999s)]
*  way a global antifada to defenseless Jewish students versus a belligerent policy against [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=896.52s)]
*  Iran thousands of miles away from Washington, D.C. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=903.9599999999999s)]
*  Well presumably, like if Iranians were inside the United States or other Muslims who identify [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=908.12s)]
*  with Iran and they were healing, let's go kill all Iranians, they would probably react [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=913.28s)]
*  in a similar way. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=917.76s)]
*  That would be really objectionable, wouldn't it? [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=918.76s)]
*  So yeah, it would be objectionable. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=921.72s)]
*  But then the question becomes, would it be something that the FBI or the police would [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=923.92s)]
*  go and investigate? [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=929.8s)]
*  And I don't think they would. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=930.8s)]
*  And let me just also note, there is some dispute about- [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=932.24s)]
*  Did you release the students? [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=935.84s)]
*  Hold on, let me just finish. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=936.84s)]
*  The administrators shouldn't allow it. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=939.84s)]
*  There is a dispute as well about the extent to which this stuff is actually happening [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=942.56s)]
*  on college campuses. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=946.7199999999999s)]
*  Nobody doubts that there's incidents like- [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=947.7199999999999s)]
*  The rest is in front. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=950.0s)]
*  The rest is in front. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=951.0s)]
*  I can show you a picture from today. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=952.0s)]
*  Max, if you just let me finish my sentence, I think you'll see that there is. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=953.0s)]
*  There was an op-ed by two Israeli-American professors in Haritz just last week, one of [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=956.76s)]
*  whom works at George Washington University and is a tenured professor there. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=962.16s)]
*  The other of whom works, I believe, at the University of Pennsylvania. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=965.8s)]
*  It's another large university in the Northeast. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=968.4799999999999s)]
*  I think it was Penn, but it might have been a different one. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=972.04s)]
*  And they wrote an op-ed to say that they are very offended as hardcore Israeli supporters, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=974.4399999999999s)]
*  as Israeli citizens, at the attempt to try and create this victim narrative around American [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=980.48s)]
*  Jews and American Jewish students. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=988.88s)]
*  And I've had other Israel supporters on my program, like Batya Ungar-Sargon, who said [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=990.9599999999999s)]
*  the same thing. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=995.76s)]
*  And what they said was their experience and the experience of many of their colleagues [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=996.76s)]
*  is that overwhelmingly, when the war in Israel and Gaza is discussed, it is civil, it is [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1001.12s)]
*  things that are being done in terms of very much well within the lines of peacefulness [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1007.4000000000001s)]
*  and reasonability. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1014.2800000000001s)]
*  I've had other professors on my show just in the past couple of weeks, including John [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1015.72s)]
*  Mearsheimer. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1020.2s)]
*  I had Rasheed Khalidi on my show. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1021.2s)]
*  I've had other professors who work in academia who have said the same thing. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1023.6s)]
*  There is a dispute about the extent to which this victimhood narrative surrounding American [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1028.8s)]
*  Jewish students is being exaggerated. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1033.88s)]
*  Like I said, many pro-Israel advocates, including the ones I've named, are saying that they [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1035.88s)]
*  are offended by this attempt to act like every pro-Palestinian or overwhelmingly pro-Palestinian [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1040.32s)]
*  protesters are being violent and threatening. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1044.88s)]
*  But I want to just get a sense of what rules you want there to be. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1047.3600000000001s)]
*  Should masks be prohibited for everybody? [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1051.3600000000001s)]
*  What's the rules? [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1053.3600000000001s)]
*  Sure. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1056.24s)]
*  I mean, before talking about that, there needs to be an actual empirical understanding of [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1057.24s)]
*  what is going on. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1062.32s)]
*  Anti-Semitism on college campuses, although libertarians and people on the far left like [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1064.52s)]
*  to try to diminish it, it is unquestionably on the rise. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1069.9199999999998s)]
*  And that includes whether you restrict your sample not just to statements, but just to [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1074.32s)]
*  violent attacks, to attacks on individuals, to throwing rocks, for example, at ASU, to [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1080.4s)]
*  setting a dorm room on fire like at Drexel. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1089.3200000000002s)]
*  And by the way, these reports of heightened, heightened levels of anti-Semitism, they do [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1093.2800000000002s)]
*  not come from one organization. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1099.0s)]
*  ADL, which I don't really like, has been a big punching bag. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1101.3600000000001s)]
*  But across organizations, they are all finding the exact same thing using different methodologies. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1105.72s)]
*  Finally, even when you restrict it to respondents who are not Jewish and who have personally [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1112.0s)]
*  witnessed what they deem to be anti-Semitic attacks, the numbers are absolutely through [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1120.1200000000001s)]
*  the roof. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1127.0s)]
*  So it's not just Jewish self-reporting. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1128.04s)]
*  This includes testimonies on a large-end sample across authors and methodologies also of non-Jews. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1130.68s)]
*  And so this is a very robust finding. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1138.72s)]
*  All right. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1141.4s)]
*  So just to so people can go in and who are interested and look at the article to which [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1142.4s)]
*  I was referring, it was from five days ago, November 26. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1148.14s)]
*  The title of it was Toxicity Does Not Rule the Hamas-Israel Debate on US College Campuses. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1152.02s)]
*  As Jewish-Israeli scholars who work in US universities, we know that the image of polarization [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1158.4s)]
*  and betrayal on campus is overblown. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1163.1200000000001s)]
*  Most students and colleagues we encounter are curious and open-minded to learn more [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1166.24s)]
*  about the Israel-Hamas War. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1169.8000000000002s)]
*  And it's written by Sakhar Pinsker, who's a professor of Middle East studies and Judaic [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1172.8000000000002s)]
*  studies at the University of Michigan, and Ari Dunbab, who is the Max Thitkin Professor [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1177.0800000000002s)]
*  of Israel Studies at George Washington University. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1182.8400000000001s)]
*  So both Israeli-American scholars who are working directly on campus just for people [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1185.2s)]
*  who want to get that conflicting opinion. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1191.72s)]
*  Do they include a large-end study? [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1194.1200000000001s)]
*  Do they include a large-end study? [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1196.96s)]
*  Or is this purely anecdotal information, Glenn? [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1199.26s)]
*  No, they're talking about both GW and the University of Michigan, for obvious reasons, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1201.8s)]
*  are centerpieces of where Israel-Gaza or Israel-Palestinian debates take place. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1208.0800000000002s)]
*  And they're saying that it's not only their experience, but the experience of colleagues [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1214.72s)]
*  of theirs that overwhelmingly the American college campuses are very peaceful and that [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1217.88s)]
*  these debates are being conducted, obviously, with some acceptance. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1224.5600000000002s)]
*  They're not, Glenn. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1227.0800000000002s)]
*  They're not. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1228.0800000000002s)]
*  Show me a large-end study that supports that. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1229.0800000000002s)]
*  They're all against you on this. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1230.0800000000002s)]
*  Well, I just referred to, I think, some evidence that I think is pretty persuasive. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1231.72s)]
*  But that's anecdotal information. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1235.88s)]
*  Well, I don't have your study in front of me. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1237.88s)]
*  And, you know, but I already said that violence, people who use violence are committing crimes. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1240.4s)]
*  So what I'm asking from you is some kind of a principle about the extent to... [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1248.76s)]
*  How do you have a principle? [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1255.0800000000002s)]
*  About what? [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1256.0800000000002s)]
*  Yes. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1257.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I'll tell you my principle. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1258.0800000000002s)]
*  My principle is the one under Brandenburg that says that it actually is permissible [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1259.0800000000002s)]
*  in the United States constitutionally to even advocate for violence. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1263.5600000000002s)]
*  Our country was born of people who said, I believe that the British crown has become [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1267.24s)]
*  so repressive that picking up arms against the central government, against the authority, [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1272.84s)]
*  is not only justified but morally necessary. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1278.1200000000001s)]
*  And the case that came before Brandenburg was a KKK leader. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1281.56s)]
*  Do you think it's okay to lie? [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1284.28s)]
*  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1285.28s)]
*  Let's just have a discussion. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1288.28s)]
*  Let me finish my thought and then you can finish yours. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1290.6s)]
*  I, you know, haven't interrupted you. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1293.56s)]
*  The Brandenburg case was a KKK leader who was convicted of terrorism for saying, I believe [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1295.34s)]
*  we should use violence against the federal government if it doesn't stop being so anti-white. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1301.7s)]
*  The case went to the Supreme Court. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1306.46s)]
*  The Supreme Court overturned the conviction and said that advocating violence is clearly [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1307.82s)]
*  within the realm of protected speech, which means that you're allowed to say, flatten [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1312.86s)]
*  Gaza, erase Gaza, remove Gaza from the map. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1318.4199999999998s)]
*  I think all Palestinians should be killed. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1321.18s)]
*  There are no innocent Palestinians. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1323.06s)]
*  There's a huge number this week of Israeli officials and journalists who have said, there's [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1325.3s)]
*  no such thing as an innocent Palestinian. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1328.26s)]
*  That's protected speech. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1330.82s)]
*  You can go on campus and say that. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1332.18s)]
*  You can say it in front of Palestinians. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1334.34s)]
*  And it's protected speech to go and say, I think the Israeli government and their occupation [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1336.86s)]
*  of the West Bank and the blockade of Gaza has become so barbaric and inhumane over decades [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1340.86s)]
*  that I think violence on the part of Palestinians is justified in order to resist it. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1347.22s)]
*  Those are both to me clearly within the realm of free speech. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1351.86s)]
*  I would never send the FBI or law enforcement after students on campuses for saying these [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1355.34s)]
*  things. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1360.02s)]
*  So I'm trying to get you mentioned masks. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1361.02s)]
*  You mentioned, you know, people who are chanting loudly. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1362.62s)]
*  Is there like a volume limit? [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1365.3799999999999s)]
*  Is there like a mass limit? [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1366.9399999999998s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1368.4599999999998s)]
*  Let me respond. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1369.4599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1370.4599999999998s)]
*  So I think that there are two, I think that there are two separate issues. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1371.4599999999998s)]
*  I mean, one is the question of constitutionality, right? [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1375.4199999999998s)]
*  One sort of the FBI might intervene. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1379.42s)]
*  And the other is like the school code of conduct. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1382.02s)]
*  You are right that certainly some offenses would be not permissible on campus, even if [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1386.74s)]
*  they wouldn't say, land somebody in prison. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1396.3400000000001s)]
*  But the problem is, is that these demonstrations, which are not all of them, but a very, you [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1400.38s)]
*  know, a sizable number of them, a sizable portion of them are extraordinarily disruptive. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1406.9s)]
*  They interfere with class. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1414.3000000000002s)]
*  They negatively affect students in ways that shouldn't be affected. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1416.8600000000001s)]
*  They're intended to scare them to interfere with their ability to learn, to go to class, [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1422.22s)]
*  to meet with each other, to study. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1429.3000000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1432.5s)]
*  And they are all things in violation of universities. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1433.5s)]
*  And so that's a university issue. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1437.7s)]
*  I, you know, I'm not a lawyer, but I also personally find it problematic in a legal [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1440.02s)]
*  sense if somebody is waving flags of foreign terrorist organizations that have a history [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1448.58s)]
*  of attacking the United States while simultaneously calling for violence against the United States [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1458.18s)]
*  at exactly the time where we're seeing elevated levels of violence against the West and intelligence [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1466.46s)]
*  agencies are saying that these actors are indeed a real threat to the West. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1473.5800000000002s)]
*  I actually do think that that's problematic for public safety issues. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1481.14s)]
*  Even if you err on the side of civil liberties. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nnZwaDRf8Y&t=1486.26s)]
