# Exposing the Surprising Significance of Mehdi Hasanâ€™s MSNBC Exit
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [January 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4)
*  Now here is a somewhat different story with a different outcome. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=0.0s)]
*  So as I mentioned Mehdi Hassan had his show canceled by MSNBC and while it was true that [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=12.0s)]
*  Mehdi Hassan's ratings were pathetic, I mean I would watch them, I would look at MSNBC's [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=21.52s)]
*  ratings when Mehdi Hassan's show is on the air and he would have something like 30,000 [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=29.12s)]
*  people, 30,000 watching his show under the age of 55 which are the only recognizable [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=34.4s)]
*  audience members that's the only one that networks can monetize which is barely the [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=42.24s)]
*  size of a mid-size YouTube program. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=47.52s)]
*  For the debate that we broadcast on Saturday night on January 6th without much promotion [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=51.56s)]
*  we had an excess of 40,000 people watching more than anyone who tuned into MSNBC on Saturday [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=59.440000000000005s)]
*  night during Mehdi Hassan's show. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=65.0s)]
*  That's how much, we're on Rumble which is a platform still unknown to at least 50% of [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=67.08s)]
*  Americans and then you had that same debate streamed on many other outlets where the audience [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=75.2s)]
*  size was infinitely greater than any show Mehdi Hassan has done. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=81.62s)]
*  At the same time though it is true that low ratings, pathetic ratings are the norm for [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=86.14s)]
*  MSNBC especially their weekend shows and their shows on Peacock, nobody is watching any of [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=92.62s)]
*  these shows. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=98.02000000000001s)]
*  And so the question is why was Mehdi Hassan removed from having his show and why was he [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=99.02000000000001s)]
*  ultimately forced out and the assumption of most of his defenders was that the reason [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=106.1s)]
*  is is because he was constrained from speaking to you harshly about Israel something he did [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=114.38s)]
*  anyway and as a result was taken out the air for it. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=120.89999999999999s)]
*  Now if you can look if you look at the circumstantial evidence you can certainly conclude that that's [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=125.78s)]
*  a plausible scenario. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=132.9s)]
*  But what's so interesting here is that Mehdi Hassan has not actually said that. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=135.78s)]
*  Mehdi Hassan could easily go and start his own independent media platform at Substack [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=141.74s)]
*  or on YouTube or at Rumble and make a lot more money than he was making at MSNBC that's [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=147.82s)]
*  for sure especially if he accompanied it by the admission that he was in a way censored. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=153.22s)]
*  And yet the reason Mehdi Hassan refuses to do that is because unlike so many people who [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=160.42000000000002s)]
*  have finally come to realize that you can be much more influential outside of corporate [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=164.85999999999999s)]
*  media in fact in a lot of ways leaving corporate media is a prerequisite to building an audience [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=170.06s)]
*  that trusts you. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=175.98s)]
*  When I left The Intercept the number of people reading my articles the number of people who [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=176.98s)]
*  watch my show the number of people who just in general across the political spectrum decided [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=183.1s)]
*  that I was trustworthy doubled and then tripled and then quadrupled and even more and hasn't [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=188.51999999999998s)]
*  and hasn't stopped because when you're independent when people understand that you're no longer [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=193.86s)]
*  subjected to the constraints of corporate media only then can you be trustworthy only [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=198.34s)]
*  then can you really build a massive audience and have a lot of influence. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=205.22s)]
*  And yet it really is still true that for some people what they value most is the kind of [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=209.94s)]
*  artificial prestige that still does come from being able to be on television with these [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=216.58s)]
*  networks even if nobody's watching. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=223.06s)]
*  One of the things we found on this show we have heard from so many other people who have [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=226.78s)]
*  independent media outlet shows that have large audiences as large as if not bigger than a [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=229.5s)]
*  lot of cable shows is that very few politicians will come on your show to be interviewed if [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=234.82s)]
*  they know that you're going to interview them adversarially. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=241.42000000000002s)]
*  They'll come on your show if you want to interview them about something where you agree with [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=243.46s)]
*  them but if it's a topic they know they're going to be grilled on they generally won't [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=246.7s)]
*  go on those shows but if CNN or MSNBC calls a Republican politician a Republican politician [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=252.64000000000001s)]
*  will often go on MSNBC or CNN even though they know they're going to be treated unfairly [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=258.28000000000003s)]
*  because there's a prestige where they get to call their family and say I'm going to [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=263.2s)]
*  be on CNN I'm going to be on MSNBC watch me. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=267.48s)]
*  There's still this kind of like reflexive craving for the approval of these corporate [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=270.8s)]
*  and it seems very obvious that Mehdi Hassan craves more than anything access to mainstream [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=277.76000000000005s)]
*  journalism and that's the reason why he's so unwilling even to claim or say that that [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=283.64000000000004s)]
*  was the reason he lost his job was because he went too far in Israel. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=290.16s)]
*  I mean if Mehdi Hassan is a journalist and that was part of why he lost his show he certainly [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=293.64000000000004s)]
*  has an obligation to say that to say that a major corporation like NBC has within it [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=298.48s)]
*  major constraints on what people can say who are journalists about a major war that's taking [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=304.56s)]
*  place but he's too afraid to say it because he doesn't want to lose his access to the [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=309.68s)]
*  possibility to keep a mainstream job which is cowardly and pathetic but that is still [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=315.44s)]
*  part of the dynamic even as independent media grows and grows and here's the point I want [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=320.88s)]
*  to conclude on with this whole episode about Mehdi Hassan and Pat McAfee which is I have [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=326.84000000000003s)]
*  heard so many journalists say that they strongly believe in fact barely question it that the [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=336.08s)]
*  reason that Mehdi Hassan lost his job at MSNBC was because he crossed the line that you're [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=341.64s)]
*  not allowed to cross in criticizing Israel too harshly and he was very adversarial in [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=346.4s)]
*  how he interviewed Israeli officials I've known Mehdi for a long time I played a major [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=352.6s)]
*  role in recruiting him to come to the intercept I know that Mehdi's dream in life was to host [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=357.92s)]
*  an MSNBC show he was willing to do or say anything in order to make that happen he became [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=363.08000000000004s)]
*  a rabid partisan to the Democratic Party which is the requirement to be there and yet he [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=368.56s)]
*  went over one line which was Israel and now he's not only had his show taken away but [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=375.16s)]
*  out of MSNBC and I think what it's so interesting is that so many journalists corporate journalists [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=380.48s)]
*  are saying that Mehdi lost his job because he went too far in criticizing Israel without [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=387.64000000000004s)]
*  realizing what they're saying about how deeply corrupt corporate media is what they're essentially [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=394.20000000000005s)]
*  saying which I believe a hundred percent based on everything I've seen having one foot in [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=399.84000000000003s)]
*  corporate media over my career and one foot out is that the only way you can stay in [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=405.14s)]
*  corporate media and work for them a condition for thriving in corporate media is that you [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=412.74s)]
*  have to stay within the lines ideologically and politically that they set and the minute [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=417.62s)]
*  you go outside of that line no matter what no matter how good your ratings are you will [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=424.18s)]
*  lose your job which is why Tucker Carlson is no longer on Fox News because Tucker Carlson [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=427.78s)]
*  was becoming too much of a nuisance in fact a threat to Republican orthodoxy that's why [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=433.54s)]
*  when Tucker Carlson lost his job so many cowardly Republican establishment members of Congress [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=439.86s)]
*  came forward and said how much easier their lives will be now that he's no longer on the [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=444.66s)]
*  air because he was too much of a dissident on things like Ukraine and now we're seeing [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=450.86s)]
*  what he's saying on Israel and Tucker Carlson's job just like every person's job in corporate [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=457.86s)]
*  media is dependent upon their willingness to stay within very rigidly constructed lines [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=465.06s)]
*  about what people can and cannot say and they're essentially admitting that by saying about [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=471.36s)]
*  Mehdi Hassan that he lost his job for crossing that line in Israel without realizing what [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=477.34s)]
*  he's saying about themselves the level of subservience to which they're willing to subject [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=481.94s)]
*  themselves to keep these jobs inside corporate media and I think more than anything the reason [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=487.06s)]
*  why corporate media has lost the trust and faith in the public is because people know [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=493.58s)]
*  their propaganda machines that they're heavily regimented. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j0UlukI-4&t=497.38s)]
