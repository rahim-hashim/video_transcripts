# Sen. Tom Cotton: Pushing for WAR with IRAN?
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [April 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk)
*  The senator from Arkansas, the Republican senator from Arkansas, Tom Cotton, is somebody [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=0.0s)]
*  who pretends to support President Trump quite a bit when in reality he actually despises [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=12.88s)]
*  the MAGA foreign policy on which Trump ran, not necessarily the one he's pursuing, restarting [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=18.3s)]
*  the bombing campaign of Biden in Yemen and escalating it, restarting the Biden-fueled [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=23.02s)]
*  war in Gaza for Israel, threatening Iran with war. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=30.52s)]
*  But Tom Cotton hates what the MAGA foreign policy is, as opposed to what Trump's so far [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=34.9s)]
*  doing. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=39.54s)]
*  And although I certainly give Trump credit for trying, we'll see if it works to end the [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=41.78s)]
*  war in Ukraine. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=46.18s)]
*  Nobody's really tried before. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=47.620000000000005s)]
*  What infers the Middle East is concerned. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=50.54s)]
*  You're not really seeing this peacemaker Trump pledge to be quite the contrary. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=53.46s)]
*  Here's Tom Cotton at a hearing yesterday. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=56.74s)]
*  The subject was what to do about Iran, whether to go to war with Iran, whether to bomb Iran, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=60.62s)]
*  which Trump is threatening to do. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=65.18s)]
*  And here's what Tom Cotton had to say about that. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=66.98s)]
*  And finally, there's some hysteria about the prospect of the president ordering these strikes [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=69.7s)]
*  or someone like you in uniform providing him advice that it's going to lead to another [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=75.18s)]
*  forever war or another endless war. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=79.5s)]
*  Are you aware of operations, maybe operations against Iran like the tanker wars? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=82.46s)]
*  By the way, for those listening to the show, when Tom Cotton snidely said, oh, there's [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=87.26s)]
*  this hysteria that if we bomb Iran, it's going to be another forever war or another endless [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=92.58s)]
*  war, he put that in scare quotes to mock the fact that the United States has been on a [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=99.14s)]
*  posture and a footing of endless war and forever wars, which obviously is true. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=104.03999999999999s)]
*  And here's what we heard in Iraq, by the way. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=109.02000000000001s)]
*  Oh, don't worry. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=110.42s)]
*  This is going to be an invasion. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=111.42s)]
*  It's going to be over very quickly. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=112.42s)]
*  Bill Kristol said it would be over in eight weeks. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=113.66000000000001s)]
*  Like eight years later, American troops were still there. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=117.02000000000001s)]
*  Nine and 10 years later, none of what we were promised would happen happened and turned [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=121.5s)]
*  into an endless war, as Tom Cotton calls it, a forever war, as did the one in Afghanistan. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=125.18s)]
*  So when these people start mocking, quote unquote, hysteria, meaning people's concerns, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=133.78s)]
*  are we getting into another Mideast war against Israel? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=138.06s)]
*  That's when you know about things are about to happen. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=142.82s)]
*  Here's the rest of what he said. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=144.54s)]
*  Operations, maybe operations against Iran, like the tanker wars in 1988, in which the [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=145.85999999999999s)]
*  forceful but discriminant application of military power did not lead to a forever war or an [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=152.34s)]
*  endless war, but rather led to peace and stability. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=157.82s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=161.5s)]
*  Those examples in our history do exist. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=162.9s)]
*  Maybe the Qasem Soleimani strike in 2020 as well that caused Iran to pull in its horns [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=166.54s)]
*  for the rest of President Trump's first term. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=170.46s)]
*  Thank you, General Cain. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=172.34s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=173.34s)]
*  So this is the sentiment, obviously asserting itself very aggressively among the Republican [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=174.34s)]
*  Senate caucus. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=180.62s)]
*  Not all of them, but a lot of them. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=181.66s)]
*  Obviously, Lindsey Graham's on board. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=183.34s)]
*  Their dream is to go to war with Iran since Iran is Israel's worst enemy. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=185.4s)]
*  That is their dream. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=189.66s)]
*  They've been wanting this for a long time. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=190.66s)]
*  And they clearly feel with President Trump in office, even though he ran saying that [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=194.02s)]
*  his most, the proudest part of his legacy from the first term was he didn't involve [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=199.02s)]
*  the U.S. in any new wars, that he wanted to be a peacemaker, that it's time to come home [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=201.94s)]
*  to use our resources at home to not fight these foreign wars. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=207.26000000000002s)]
*  Clearly, Tom Cotton, at least, and many others think that it's very likely. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=211.10000000000002s)]
*  We'll see how that turns out. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=217.34s)]
*  I'm not convinced that Trump's going to go to war with Iran. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=220.58s)]
*  I do think he threatens war a lot in order to get what he wants. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=222.82s)]
*  But if he doesn't get what he wants, he told Hamas while the ceasefire was still in place, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=227.54s)]
*  the one that he facilitated and took credit for, rightly so, he said if you don't release [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=231.18s)]
*  all the hostages immediately, as opposed to in accordance with the agreement that we negotiated [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=237.06s)]
*  with you, hell is going to rain down upon you. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=243.58s)]
*  And that's exactly what the Israelis are doing now. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=245.7s)]
*  And there was an article from the Wall Street Journal today about how Miriam Adelson and [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=247.38s)]
*  Ben Shapiro were the ones who arranged for Trump to meet with the family members of the [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=251.78s)]
*  hostages and other hostages who were released. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=257.26s)]
*  And they told him all these stories and enraged him. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=261.42s)]
*  And he was like, we need to get those hostages out immediately. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=264.06s)]
*  And when Hamas said, no, we're going to stick to the agreement, that's when Trump greenlit [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=268.98s)]
*  Israel going back in and bombing far more indiscriminately still. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=275.18s)]
*  Earlier this week, there's a lot of evidence that they just summarily executed 15 aid workers, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=279.66s)]
*  ambulance drivers, including some who were bound with their hands and feet, so helpless [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=286.9s)]
*  detainees. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=293.58s)]
*  They shot them and threw them into a pit and then covered the pit. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=294.58s)]
*  And those bodies were found because they had been disappeared. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=298.5s)]
*  These are the kind of things that are happening now, and obviously with Trump's consent. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=300.34000000000003s)]
*  And so when Trump's threatening Iran, you cannot be so certain that it's only to have [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=307.58000000000004s)]
*  negotiating leverage to get a good deal for their nuclear program. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=313.74s)]
*  We had a deal in place, of course, that Trump withdrew from and invalidated. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=317.02000000000004s)]
*  He said it wasn't a very good deal. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=320.46000000000004s)]
*  And of course, Trump's saying, I prefer to have a deal. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=324.22s)]
*  But if we don't have a deal, we're going to bomb Iran. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=326.34000000000003s)]
*  And you have to take seriously, given what just happened in Gaza, given what's now happening [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=328.70000000000005s)]
*  in Yemen, that Trump's perfectly willing to start a new Mideast war. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=331.74s)]
*  And certainly Tom Cotting so and is very excited about that. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYg332Ve-rk&t=335.18s)]
