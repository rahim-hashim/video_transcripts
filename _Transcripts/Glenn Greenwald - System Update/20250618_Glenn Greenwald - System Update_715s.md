# Trump Turns Against Tucker Carlson over Iran?
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o)
*  Now, last night we talked about the fact that there had been some prominent voices inside [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=0.0s)]
*  MAGA, inside the Republican Party, that had been for months urging Trump to avoid a war [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=10.96s)]
*  with Iran, not to get sucked in by Israel, to resolve this diplomatically. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=16.68s)]
*  And one of those people has been Tucker Carlson, arguably the person who has done more to try [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=21.8s)]
*  and avert a war with Iran than any single other person. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=27.080000000000002s)]
*  In fact, going back to 2020, when Trump killed or ordered assassinated Iran's top general, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=29.48s)]
*  Salmane, Tucker Carlson was vehemently opposed to that, denounced it before it was done, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=35.24s)]
*  argued against it before it was done, denounced it after. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=40.120000000000005s)]
*  He thought it worked hard to have Jay-Z Vance picked as Trump's vice president because he [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=44.120000000000005s)]
*  thought that Trump would be there, or Vance would be there as kind of a restraint against [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=48.64s)]
*  these neocon warmongering voices like Marco Rubio that were going to be in the administration. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=52.24s)]
*  And he's been arguing privately and publicly for a long time that Trump will destroy his [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=57.16s)]
*  presidency and the MAGA movement if he drags the United States into a new war. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=61.44s)]
*  So unprovoked, because Tucker Carlson was with Steve Bannon yesterday, Tucker Carlson went [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=66.88s)]
*  on Steve Bannon's podcast, Steve Bannon went on Tucker's, where they talked about the huge [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=73.47999999999999s)]
*  mistake of getting involved in this war, and it was still done from the perspective of [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=78.52s)]
*  not having been done yet. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=81.67999999999999s)]
*  They weren't really criticizing Trump. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=82.67999999999999s)]
*  They were kind of trying to urge Trump not to let Netanyahu suck him into this war. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=84.0s)]
*  And Tucker Carlson was doing it from a place of praise for Trump, saying, I've known Trump [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=89.2s)]
*  for a long time. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=93.4s)]
*  I really believe he views war as a horrific human event that he has a genuine desire to [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=94.4s)]
*  avoid it. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=100.72s)]
*  When he talks about peace, it's very genuine. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=101.72s)]
*  They both agreed on that. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  And then Tucker Carlson was saying, if you let the neocons and the Israelis permit you [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=104.32s)]
*  the United States be dragged into the war they've always wanted the U.S. to fight for [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=109.68s)]
*  Israel, you're going to destroy your presidency. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=114.76s)]
*  You're going to split the MAGA movement. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=116.52000000000001s)]
*  And he was doing it from this place of like, I want to be a voice that encourages you to [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=118.52000000000001s)]
*  think about what's good for the country and knowing that I'm appealing to what I truly [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=123.04s)]
*  believe is your good side. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=127.32000000000001s)]
*  And this is what Trump had to say in response. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=129.88s)]
*  He posted this. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=132.4s)]
*  Trump did very shortly after we finished our program. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=133.64000000000001s)]
*  Last night, as soon as we were done, one of my colleagues alerted me to it. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=136.2s)]
*  This is what he posted. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=139.95999999999998s)]
*  Quote, somebody please explain to Kuki Tucker Carlson that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=141.32s)]
*  Now, you note here, everything Trump is saying, this is the part that I find most dangerous, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=148.07999999999998s)]
*  this is the part that I believe is Trump actually believing what he's saying, is that he has [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=152.83999999999997s)]
*  reduced it in his mind to a very simplistic formulation. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=157.67999999999998s)]
*  One that he keeps repeating is simple, which is either Iran gets a nuclear weapon or you [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=161.16s)]
*  go to war and prevent them from having one. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=166.88s)]
*  And since Iran having a nuclear weapon is unacceptable, only a war to prevent them from [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=168.88s)]
*  having one or an agreement where they agree to give up their entire nuclear program, including [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=173.48s)]
*  energy, are the only two options. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=177.6s)]
*  He keeps saying it's very simple, they can't have a nuclear weapon. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=180.56s)]
*  But the question of whether Iran was actually trying to get a nuclear weapon, whether they [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=184.06s)]
*  were negotiating to allow whatever safeguards were necessary to ensure that they didn't, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=188.0s)]
*  that has all been swept to the side. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=191.92s)]
*  It's now taken as a given in Trump's mind and therefore in the mind of his supporters [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=193.16s)]
*  and the minds of a lot of the media narrative as well, that Iran was trying to get a nuclear [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=197.16s)]
*  weapon. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=202.56s)]
*  And so the only way to debate this war is are you in favor of allowing Iran to get a [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=203.56s)]
*  nuclear weapon or do you want to go to war with them and destroy the country? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=206.08s)]
*  And that's all there is in Trump's mind are those two questions. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=210.16s)]
*  But Attack and Tuck Carlson that way, unprovoked, I think is an attempt by Trump to signal to [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=214.1s)]
*  podcasters or activists or MAGA influencers or Republican politicians that no dissent [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=220.66s)]
*  is permitted, especially when it comes to something very important to Trump, which suddenly [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=229.66s)]
*  clearly has become destroying Iran or the war or regime change in Iran or the war in [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=233.5s)]
*  Iran. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=238.14s)]
*  And then anybody who speaks up and challenges Trump or question Trump, he will expel them [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=239.14s)]
*  from the MAGA world, from Trump world. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=243.42s)]
*  He'll revoke their MAGA card. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=247.62s)]
*  And a lot of influencers and pundits and the like are seeing that, people whose careers [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=250.29999999999998s)]
*  and profit depends upon access to the White House, access to Trump. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=254.98s)]
*  He purposely chose the most popular and influential one, Trump did, Tuck Carlson, to say, look, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=260.92s)]
*  if I can do this, Tuck Carlson, for even mild questioning of my war, any of you will just [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=265.3s)]
*  be instantly banished from the kingdom. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=272.5s)]
*  It's just punishment for dissent is what that obviously is. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=274.7s)]
*  Now, JD Vance, knowing that that's not a very substantive or sophisticated case that Trump [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=277.78s)]
*  is making, went to Twitter today to try and defend Trump. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=283.82s)]
*  No hesitation at all, no questioning at all about whether this is the right war. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=287.9s)]
*  Suddenly, JD Vance is a voluntarily public advocate and cheerleader for this war, this [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=292.02s)]
*  unprovoked war that Israel is fighting against its enemy and now dragging the United States [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=297.14s)]
*  into. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=300.34s)]
*  And here's what he had to say on Twitter, quote, look, I'm seeing this from the inside. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=302.5s)]
*  I'm admittedly biased toward our president and my friend. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=306.5s)]
*  But there's a lot of crazy stuff on social media, so I wanted to address some things [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=310.21999999999997s)]
*  directly on the Iran issue. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=313.18s)]
*  First, the president has been amazingly consistent over 10 years that Iran cannot have a nuclear [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=314.82s)]
*  weapon. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=319.78s)]
*  Over the last few months, he encouraged his foreign policy team to reach a deal with the [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=321.04s)]
*  Iranians to accomplish this goal. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=324.22s)]
*  The president has made clear that Iran cannot have uranium enrichment. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=326.24s)]
*  And he said repeatedly that this would happen one of two ways, the easy way or quote, the [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=330.73999999999995s)]
*  other way. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=334.41999999999996s)]
*  Now, the idea that going to war the minute the Israelis want one with Iran, trying to [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=335.41999999999996s)]
*  change their regime or destroy all their nuclear facilities, ordering 10, 15 million people [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=340.61999999999995s)]
*  to evacuate Tehran as President Trump ordered them to do last night at 2 in the morning [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=345.52s)]
*  of their time, but that somehow consistent with everything he's been saying for the last [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=350.41999999999996s)]
*  10 years is obviously preposterous. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=354.73999999999995s)]
*  That's why so many people who are prominent followers of his and supporters are his are [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=357.34s)]
*  feeling very confused because they let he led them to believe the exact opposite. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=361.5s)]
*  There was no suggestion from Trump over the last 10 years that he's going to go to war [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=366.53999999999996s)]
*  with Israel against Iran if they don't reach a deal on the exact day that Trump sets us [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=369.34s)]
*  the deadline. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=376.26s)]
*  And again, you see JD Vance there kind of just sliding over the fact of whether Iran [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=377.26s)]
*  was actually trying to get a nuclear weapon in the first place. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=383.41999999999996s)]
*  Yes, Trump has always said Iran can't have a nuclear weapon. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=385.66s)]
*  Everybody said that. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=388.78000000000003s)]
*  Obama said that. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=389.78000000000003s)]
*  Biden said that Hillary Clinton says that George Bush said everyone has said that. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=390.78000000000003s)]
*  But none of them ever went to war with Iran because they didn't believe Iran was seeking [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=395.5s)]
*  a nuclear weapon. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=399.5s)]
*  That was the consensus of our intelligence agency that they weren't. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=400.5s)]
*  And then Obama created a framework that everybody agrees monitored the Iranians to make sure [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=403.06s)]
*  they weren't trying to obtain a nuclear weapon. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=409.5s)]
*  And so here's JD Vance just trying to say he's been consistent on this for 10 years [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=412.46s)]
*  and so this war with Iran that he's now assuming has his own somehow is what you should have [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=415.7s)]
*  expected based on everything that he said over the last decade. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=420.21999999999997s)]
*  Does anyone actually believe that? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=422.9s)]
*  Vance goes on, quote, second, I've seen a lot of confusion over the issue of, quote, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=425.46s)]
*  civilian nuclear power and, quote, uranium enrichment. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=430.06s)]
*  These are distinct issues. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=432.97999999999996s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=434.17999999999995s)]
*  The confusion is coming from Trump and from the U.S. government. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=435.17999999999995s)]
*  Iran could have civilian nuclear power without enrichment, but Iran rejected that. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=437.97999999999996s)]
*  This statement is false. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=442.65999999999997s)]
*  You cannot have nuclear power, civilian nuclear power, without uranium enrichment. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=444.68s)]
*  Uranium enrichment is a prerequisite to having civilian nuclear energy. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=449.7s)]
*  What JD Vance means here is that Iran could have a nuclear program, but they wouldn't [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=453.97999999999996s)]
*  be enriching the uranium themselves. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=458.53999999999996s)]
*  It would be enriched in Saudi Arabia or the UAE or in some other place in the region and [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=459.53999999999996s)]
*  then it would be given to Iran when they needed it so they weren't enriching the uranium themselves [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=465.29999999999995s)]
*  as a way to guarantee that it never went above a certain percent and they would dismantle [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=470.34000000000003s)]
*  all their own facilities. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=474.38000000000005s)]
*  Why would Iran ever agree to be dependent upon some other country to provide them with [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=475.82000000000005s)]
*  what they're entitled to have? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=481.06s)]
*  They're going to be dependent on Saudi Arabia to give them the enriched uranium in order [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=482.54s)]
*  to keep their nuclear energy plants going? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=489.26000000000005s)]
*  They had to deal with the United States, with Obama, and three years later President Trump [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=492.86s)]
*  withdrew from it and nullified it. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=497.56s)]
*  Why would they trust the United States or some other country to enrich uranium for them? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=499.14s)]
*  The deal was always supposed to be that they were going to have their own enriched uranium [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=503.26s)]
*  but have safeguards in place to make sure they didn't get a nuclear weapon and nothing [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=507.53999999999996s)]
*  should have changed in that regard. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=510.38s)]
*  Other than the fact that Trump started speaking to a bunch of neocons spending his days talking [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=511.7s)]
*  to Sean Hannity and Mark Levin and Lindsey Graham and Tom Cotton and especially Benjamin [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=515.34s)]
*  Netanyahu, all the same liars who have lied the US into war repeatedly and they were the [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=520.46s)]
*  ones who persuaded him that enrichment means Iran has a nuclear weapons program and that's [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=524.7s)]
*  something he said that they can't have and since Iran at the negotiating table isn't [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=530.1800000000001s)]
*  willing to give that up, that means Iran is no longer willing to do a deal and that's [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=533.0200000000001s)]
*  what convinced Trump where it was inevitable. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=536.9000000000001s)]
*  Vance goes on, quote, meanwhile Iran has enriched uranium far above the level necessary for [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=540.1400000000001s)]
*  any civilian purpose. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=544.3000000000001s)]
*  They've been found in violation of their nonproliferation obligations by the IAEA, which is hardly a [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=546.1s)]
*  right wing organization. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=550.34s)]
*  It's one thing to want civilian nuclear energy, it's another thing to demand sophisticated [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=552.02s)]
*  enrichment capacity and it's still another to cling to enrichment while simultaneously [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=555.38s)]
*  violating basic nonproliferation obligations and enriching right to the point of weapons [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=559.5799999999999s)]
*  grade uranium. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=564.86s)]
*  I have yet to see a single good argument for why Iran needed to enrich uranium while above [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=565.86s)]
*  the threshold for civilian use. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=570.14s)]
*  I've yet to see a single good argument for why Iran was justified in violating its nonproliferation [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=571.78s)]
*  obligations. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=575.9399999999999s)]
*  I've yet to see a single good pushback against the IAEA's findings. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=576.9399999999999s)]
*  If you look at the IAEA report by the way, it specifically says there's no evidence that [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=579.9s)]
*  Iran has reactivated a nuclear program, that it's suspended in 2003, exactly what Tulsi [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=583.78s)]
*  Gabbard said. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=587.66s)]
*  But the reason Iran was enriching uranium above the percentage originally required by [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=589.9399999999999s)]
*  the Iran deal is precisely because Trump withdrew from the Iran deal. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=595.06s)]
*  But there was still no evidence that the entire war is now predicated on that they were seeking [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=600.54s)]
*  a nuclear weapon. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=605.02s)]
*  It's basically like there was no evidence for what the Iraq war was predicated on that [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=606.64s)]
*  Saddam Hussein was seeking nuclear weapons and had weapons of mass destruction. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=609.6s)]
*  Vance goes on, quote, meanwhile the president has shown remarkable restraint in keeping [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=613.0s)]
*  our military's focus on protecting our troops and protecting our citizens. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=617.3199999999999s)]
*  He may decide he needs to take further action to end uranium enrichment. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=621.48s)]
*  That decision ultimately belongs to the president. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=626.84s)]
*  And of course people are right to be worried about foreign entanglement after the last [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=629.24s)]
*  25 years of idiotic foreign policy. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=632.68s)]
*  First of all, this decision does not belong to the president. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=634.8399999999999s)]
*  If you read the Constitution, which I presume J.D. Vance has done, he graduated from Yale [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=638.7199999999999s)]
*  Law School, Article 1 reserves the war-making power not to the presidency but to the Congress. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=642.88s)]
*  He'd have to go to the Congress and get approval for that war. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=647.88s)]
*  I know that's very quaint. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=651.1999999999999s)]
*  I know presidents don't do that anymore, but that is actually how the republic was constructed. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=652.1999999999999s)]
*  That decision to fight a war with Iran or attack Iran does not belong to the president. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=656.4799999999999s)]
*  He goes on, but I believe the president has earned some trust on this issue. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=662.56s)]
*  And having seen this up close and personal, I can assure you that he is only interested [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=666.52s)]
*  in using the American military to accomplish the American people's goals. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=669.92s)]
*  Whatever he does, that is his focus. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=673.4s)]
*  I found that exceptionally unpersuasive. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=677.0799999999999s)]
*  You can decide for yourself how you feel about it. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=679.04s)]
*  But again, J.D. Vance is acknowledging, and the reason he put out a statement is because [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=680.88s)]
*  Trump is very close to involving the United States militarily in this war. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZTKgFOgq5o&t=685.1999999999999s)]
