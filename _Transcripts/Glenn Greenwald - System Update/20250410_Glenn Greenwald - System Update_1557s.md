# Trump's Tariff Fallout EXPLAINED
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [April 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58)
*  David Sirota is a longtime investigative journalist, a very dogged one at that. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=0.0s)]
*  He's a best-selling author. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=11.36s)]
*  He's the founder of The Lever, which is a reader support, The Lever News, which is a [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=12.8s)]
*  reader-supported outlet reshaping political and economic reporting in America. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=16.52s)]
*  He identifies, I believe, explicitly as someone on the progressive left, and yet his reporting [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=21.36s)]
*  is exactly the kind of journalism we need, where he just pursues facts without that kind [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=25.72s)]
*  of agenda driving it. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=29.96s)]
*  His work has often shaped national headlines from exposing Wall Street secrecy to prompting [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=31.04s)]
*  government investigations, and he was even nominated for an Academy Award for co-creating [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=35.28s)]
*  the Netflix blockbuster Don't Look Up. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=39.52s)]
*  I've known David for a long time. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=44.08s)]
*  We've had him on our show before. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=45.08s)]
*  It's always great to have him back. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=46.32s)]
*  Good to see you, David. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=47.56s)]
*  Good evening. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=48.56s)]
*  Thanks for joining us. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=49.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=51.24s)]
*  Thanks so much for having me. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=52.24s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=53.24s)]
*  I want to talk about the latest developments in Trump's tariff plan. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=54.32s)]
*  As I'm sure you know, earlier today he announced a 90-day pause on that tariff plan, as many [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=60.36s)]
*  of his billionaire funders like Bill Ackman have been calling for. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=65.76s)]
*  The only exception is China, where he's keeping those tariffs in place, and now they're retaliating. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=68.48s)]
*  I want to get into the minutiae of the deal itself and what your thoughts are. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=73.04s)]
*  Before I get to that, I just want to ask you as a broader perspective. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=80.08s)]
*  For as long as I can remember, the left's critique of the Democratic Party, people like [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=87.12s)]
*  the Clintons, was that they had devastated the manufacturing base, deindustrialized the [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=91.32s)]
*  middle of the country, shipped jobs overseas with things like NAFTA and the Obama-Clinton [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=97.96s)]
*  support for TPP. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=102.75999999999999s)]
*  They were just very aggressive advocates of free trade, and the argument was that was [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=104.42s)]
*  when the Democratic Party started representing much more the affluent and wealthy class in [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=108.56s)]
*  Wall Street and abandoned what had been their base of the working class. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=113.11999999999999s)]
*  That's certainly a lot of how working class voters perceive it too. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=116.75999999999999s)]
*  If you lose your jobs, if your town becomes shuttered, you're going to have a good understanding, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=119.39999999999999s)]
*  even if you're not a political junkie, of who and what did that. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=122.88s)]
*  Trump did do some tariffs in the first term, but this is really the first time in years [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=128.56s)]
*  where we have a president standing up and saying, the current status quo of globalism, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=132.84s)]
*  free trade, offshoring jobs, has destroyed the United States in so many ways, and it's [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=137.16s)]
*  time that we have to implement a new financial order that doesn't produce as kinds of consequences [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=142.24s)]
*  for the United States. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=148.96s)]
*  Do you consider that fact, independent of the specifics of Trump's tariff policy, to [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=150.68s)]
*  be a positive development? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=156.4s)]
*  It depends on how successful the tariffs are. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=160.32s)]
*  By that, I mean, it depends on whether the tariff policy actually gets this right, because [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=164.8s)]
*  if the tariff policy doesn't get things right, I think there's going to be a backlash to [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=169.84s)]
*  the free trade backlash. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=174.76000000000002s)]
*  I agree with you that Donald Trump has made an opportunity out of Democrats' advocacy [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=177.52s)]
*  for things like NAFTA, the China PNTR deal, the TPP that you mentioned, all sorts of free [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=186.12s)]
*  trade deals. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=192.20000000000002s)]
*  The Democrats weren't alone. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=193.2s)]
*  George W. Bush's administration pushed for all sorts of free trade deals. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=194.51999999999998s)]
*  John McCain and all of them. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=197.95999999999998s)]
*  John McCain, exactly. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=200.35999999999999s)]
*  This is a bipartisan elite push over the last 30 years to change America's trade policy [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=202.11999999999998s)]
*  into a tariff-free trade policy, which Ross Perot, by the way, warned of. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=210.04s)]
*  Ross Perot warned that if you force American workers to compete with workers making a dollar [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=214.83999999999997s)]
*  a day in countries that do not have any real environmental laws or any environmental enforcement, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=221.64000000000001s)]
*  you're going to essentially incentivize corporations to pick up shop and troll the world for the [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=228.92000000000002s)]
*  worst possible conditions, the most exploitable possible conditions. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=234.0s)]
*  That has happened, and the Democrats have really stuck with free trade. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=238.22s)]
*  Most of the Republican Party had, up until this point, stuck with that idea that this [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=242.68s)]
*  sort of transition would be great for everybody because the benefits would outweigh the consequences, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=248.64s)]
*  the benefits being lower prices. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=254.07999999999998s)]
*  Now, there's even dispute over whether that's true, whether there's been studies showing [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=256.12s)]
*  that the benefits of lower prices have actually not outweighed the losses in wages and jobs [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=261.4s)]
*  for the average American. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=269.84s)]
*  Trump has tapped into a very real and, to my mind, very legitimate backlash. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=272.15999999999997s)]
*  The problem is, to my mind, is that what Trump is proposing is not really a strategic use [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=277.36s)]
*  of tariffs in a way that I see, at least I don't see any evidence yet, that is really [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=284.40000000000003s)]
*  designed to rebuild manufacturing in the United States. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=290.44s)]
*  Doing sort of across-the-board tariffs with no timetable for implementation to allow factories [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=294.88s)]
*  to be reshored, for the production capacity to be rebuilt, I think then raises the question, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=303.44s)]
*  well, what are we really doing here? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=309.32s)]
*  Just throwing up tariffs, you wake up one day and say it's Liberation Day, throwing [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=311.23999999999995s)]
*  up tariffs is not giving industry a chance to react to the tariffs, to build that production [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=314.91999999999996s)]
*  capacity, to rehire Americans to do manufacturing jobs. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=322.91999999999996s)]
*  So I think, in a sense, what we're seeing now is kind of a power grab by Trump. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=328.64s)]
*  Trump wants to, and maybe a shock to the system, a way to say, hey, we're not doing free trade [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=332.8s)]
*  anymore, so I'm going to shock the system in a really aggressive way. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=338.44s)]
*  And there's also a power grab element where every corporation that wants an exemption [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=341.8s)]
*  has to come and kiss the ring of the president to try to get an exemption. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=345.28000000000003s)]
*  So I guess what I'm saying is I don't see necessarily any evidence that this is a well [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=350.2s)]
*  thought out use of tariffs that will deliver what Trump says it will deliver. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=354.84000000000003s)]
*  And if it doesn't deliver it, this is a long way of getting to your question, is if it [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=360.04s)]
*  doesn't deliver it, what I fear is that gives the people who push NAFTA, the people who [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=363.68s)]
*  push China PNTR an opportunity to say all tariffs are bad, all tariffs are destructive, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=370.04s)]
*  and there is no such thing as a smart, managed fair trade policy. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=376.68s)]
*  We have to continue with the free trade policy that we've been with for the last 30 years. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=381.44s)]
*  Yeah, that's absolutely a fair concern. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=386.04s)]
*  I guess time will tell what he is planning to do. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=387.56s)]
*  I mean, you think today was a kind of retreat or maybe a modification. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=390.68s)]
*  And I want to talk about that in a second with this pause and the idea that now we're [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=394.28000000000003s)]
*  going to negotiate not just tariffs, but investment or opening up factories in the US or whatever. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=397.8s)]
*  We'll see if that works out. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=402.44s)]
*  I just want to ask one more question, though, about the sort of debate that has been provoked. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=403.76s)]
*  I saw Trump's billionaire Treasury Secretary, Scott Benson, who had long worked for George [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=410.12s)]
*  Soros and his wealth fund and then opened up his own hedge fund, was very successful [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=417.76s)]
*  in trading in the way that makes you a billionaire, always has been a Republican for the most [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=423.44s)]
*  part. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=428.8s)]
*  But once he had to go out and defend these tariffs, I saw him at least twice, maybe three [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=431.48s)]
*  times in a very clear and passionate way arguing this. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=437.6s)]
*  He was saying, when people are saying, well, you have to be concerned about the reaction [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=442.70000000000005s)]
*  of the stock market, the decline in the stock market. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=447.76000000000005s)]
*  He was saying, look, the top 10% of wealth in the United States owns 90% of the stock [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=449.84000000000003s)]
*  market. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=457.84000000000003s)]
*  The bottom 90% of the stock market owns 10% of the wealth. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=458.96000000000004s)]
*  And the reason for that is we pursued this policy in this global trade system, free trade [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=462.98s)]
*  system for so long, that only benefited Wall Street. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=467.4s)]
*  And so who cares if Wall Street is angry? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=471.84s)]
*  Now is the time where we can't please and pleasure and accommodate Wall Street. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=473.56s)]
*  We instead have to be thinking about Main Street and the ordinary person. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=477.59999999999997s)]
*  And then on the other hand, I'm not saying this is true of all Democrats, obviously, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=482.47999999999996s)]
*  but the kind of mainstream democratic reaction to this is like, oh my God, look what Trump's [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=487.32s)]
*  doing. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=491.59999999999997s)]
*  Wall Street is collapsing. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=492.59999999999997s)]
*  Kind of saying like, oh, our concern has to be what Wall Street wants, what Wall Street [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=494.6s)]
*  thinks is good. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=498.76000000000005s)]
*  I mean, I guess, I mean, again, independent of your concern about the Trump tariffs and [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=499.76000000000005s)]
*  the results, which I want to get to next, having the Trump Treasury Secretary come out [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=506.40000000000003s)]
*  with this extremely populist rhetoric with these accurate facts about the vast gap in [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=511.32000000000005s)]
*  wealth that this system has created in the United States and the need to erode it or [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=516.2s)]
*  erase it or reverse it. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=521.9200000000001s)]
*  I mean, isn't that in some way a helpful contribution to how Americans understand the [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=523.5600000000001s)]
*  economy? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=528.0400000000001s)]
*  I think it is in the sense that I think that reminding the country that Wall Street is [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=530.72s)]
*  not Main Street is important. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=537.6s)]
*  When you turn on cable TV news, you're led to believe that Wall Street is Main Street, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=539.76s)]
*  that the stock market is the economy when clearly it isn't. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=544.72s)]
*  And I've been kind of struck by the fact that this Treasury Secretary who comes from Wall [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=548.6s)]
*  Street, in many instances that I've seen him interviewed, he sounds like Bernie Sanders. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=552.64s)]
*  Bernie Sanders is making that point. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=557.56s)]
*  But that's that. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=559.12s)]
*  Now, I also don't think it's that simple in this way that it is true that the wealthiest [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=560.64s)]
*  10 percent own about 90, 93 percent of the stock market. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=568.04s)]
*  But that doesn't mean the other 90 percent owns no part of that stock market or has no [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=572.08s)]
*  connection to what that stock market reflects. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=579.0400000000001s)]
*  I mean, millions of people have 401K plans. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=582.0400000000001s)]
*  That may not represent among working class, middle class people, a large portion of the [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=585.5600000000001s)]
*  stock market, but it represents at an individual level a significant portion of people's [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=591.64s)]
*  retirement savings if they're lucky enough to have retirement savings. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=597.0s)]
*  Same thing for union pension funds. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=600.72s)]
*  Union pension funds have large holdings in the stock market. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=603.0s)]
*  So I don't think it separates as cleanly as the statistics seems to suggest it does. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=606.76s)]
*  I think that the country does have the country's economy is woven into or at least has a [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=614.52s)]
*  relationship with the stock market. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=620.8000000000001s)]
*  And I don't think the stock market going down is something that we can just say, oh, it [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=623.0400000000001s)]
*  completely doesn't matter or even celebrating it going down. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=627.4s)]
*  There is a linkage there. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=631.96s)]
*  I don't necessarily think that we need to take policy cues. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=634.08s)]
*  Oh, if this or that policy happens and the stock market reacts, that means the policy [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=638.6800000000001s)]
*  is bad. When I see liberals or conservatives say that, oh, look at this policy, the stock [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=644.64s)]
*  market's going down. That's not the right way to judge the merits of a policy. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=650.32s)]
*  I mean, for instance, if there was a president, Bernie Sanders, and he put forward a Medicare [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=654.5999999999999s)]
*  for All bill, my guess would be the stock market for at least a little bit might react [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=659.3599999999999s)]
*  negatively to that because the stock market reflects a lot of health insurance companies. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=666.0799999999999s)]
*  That doesn't mean the policy is wrong. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=669.88s)]
*  So I don't like the idea that look at the stock market and the stock market should tell [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=672.0s)]
*  us what policy is correct. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=676.5999999999999s)]
*  I would say look at the stock market to see what potential sort of impact this is going [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=678.72s)]
*  to have, broadly speaking. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=687.64s)]
*  But again, we're talking hours after Trump set aside or at least delayed some of these [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=689.44s)]
*  tariffs and the stock market went back up. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=696.12s)]
*  So it's also a pretty volatile sort of not consistent barometer of what's really going [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=698.2s)]
*  on. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=704.28s)]
*  For sure. I think the statistic that I've seen and right in this area is something like [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=704.96s)]
*  60 percent of Americans have some money in the stock market and 40 percent have none. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=710.24s)]
*  And just anecdotally, I mean, I know kind of normies in my life, people who are not [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=716.48s)]
*  very particularly focused on politics, are not partisan at all, but they've all been [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=721.36s)]
*  concerned about the decline of their 401k, exactly as you said, which is tied to the [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=727.24s)]
*  stock market performance. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=731.68s)]
*  That's people's retirement. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=732.56s)]
*  All right. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=734.08s)]
*  So I don't know what Trump planned from the start. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=734.44s)]
*  I'm not sure he necessarily knew, but I got the sense, David, that given how many [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=738.08s)]
*  decades Trump has been pounding this issue, like other countries, everything is off. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=745.9200000000001s)]
*  The United States has to stop this. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=751.12s)]
*  You know, we're taking a bloodbath, whatever, that he was prepared. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=753.16s)]
*  And there's been some reporting in general that Trump in his second term, probably not [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=756.64s)]
*  thinking about a third term in reality, kind of has a sort of devil may care attitude. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=761.16s)]
*  Like he doesn't care if what he does creates negative media reaction, even performs [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=766.2s)]
*  badly in the polls. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=772.0s)]
*  He has an idea of what he wants to do in his second term and he's going to do it no [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=772.88s)]
*  matter what. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=775.9200000000001s)]
*  And so my belief is that he really was truthful about what he was saying from the [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=776.96s)]
*  start, which was, look, we are going to have some short term pain. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=783.52s)]
*  You're just going to have to bear it because on the other side of that, we're going to [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=785.72s)]
*  finally have a fairer and more prosperous system for everybody. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=789.4s)]
*  And then suddenly today, he announces this 90 day pause, which is what several of his [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=794.24s)]
*  billionaire supporters were calling for. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=801.4399999999999s)]
*  Bill Ackman was actually on Monday. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=803.68s)]
*  He said exactly that. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=804.9599999999999s)]
*  I want a 90 day pause on this. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=806.04s)]
*  And then it wasn't just even the stock market. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=808.64s)]
*  What I think was alarming so many people was what the bond market was doing, which is [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=810.36s)]
*  taking down presidents before in the UK and France and elsewhere. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=813.96s)]
*  People are super afraid of bondholders in the bond market. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=818.12s)]
*  And then Trump did a very uncharacteristic reversal, obviously tried to paint it in a [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=822.3199999999999s)]
*  positive light or whatever. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=827.12s)]
*  There's a lot of talk these days about how the United States is an oligarchy, kind of [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=829.12s)]
*  like the richest people dictate power, the president's constrained no matter who the [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=833.48s)]
*  president is by what they want by their interests. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=838.16s)]
*  Was this an example illustrating that to you? [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=840.8s)]
*  Or kind of, I guess, even Trump with his lack of political concerns was sort of forced to [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=843.76s)]
*  retreat by the reaction of the wealthiest people? [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=849.52s)]
*  I think it's hard to psychoanalyze Donald Trump. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=855.12s)]
*  So I try not to try to get inside of his mind. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=858.12s)]
*  What I can say is this, I think you're absolutely right that this is one of the areas that [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=861.52s)]
*  Donald Trump has actually been one of the few areas that he's actually been consistent on, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=866.7199999999999s)]
*  at least in terms of rhetoric. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=872.16s)]
*  He has been talking about a fairer trade policy, whether you agree with the policy or not. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=873.72s)]
*  He has been talking about this issue for a very, very long time. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=879.16s)]
*  I mean, he almost ran for president in 2000 under the party of Ross Perot. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=882.96s)]
*  I mean, you can go look that up, the Reform Party. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=888.32s)]
*  So this is something that he has thought a lot about, spoken a lot about, written at [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=890.44s)]
*  times about in his books. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=895.5600000000001s)]
*  So he clearly has a pretty set in stone views, overarching views about America's current [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=898.16s)]
*  trading system, the sort of free trade system. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=906.8000000000001s)]
*  Now, he may have a theory about how he is going to try to get a supposedly fairer deal, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=910.48s)]
*  or at least what he perceives to be a fairer deal by maybe this is one of these situations [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=917.64s)]
*  where he thinks there's sort of the madman theory. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=923.28s)]
*  I'm going to show the world that I'm really serious about this by saying I'm doing, you [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=925.88s)]
*  know, 100 percent tariff on China. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=929.6800000000001s)]
*  We're doing across the board tariffs on all these countries. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=931.6800000000001s)]
*  And slowly but surely after I make that announcement, everyone, the world is going to [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=934.12s)]
*  get scared and try to cut more favorable trade deals with our country to kind of even [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=938.24s)]
*  things out. Like, is this three dimensional chess? [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=944.4s)]
*  Maybe that's what's going on. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=947.36s)]
*  Maybe it's not. It's really hard to know. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=948.6800000000001s)]
*  Was he controlled by the oligarchs in the 90 day, this 90 day pause? [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=951.48s)]
*  Or was that or did it come to be part of his thinking that it would be a good negotiating [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=956.04s)]
*  strategy that ultimately he is fearful of actually crashing the stock market, crashing [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=962.8000000000001s)]
*  the economy. And so this is all a game of chicken to try to get a better a better policy. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=968.36s)]
*  Or, Glenn, you know, is this just a pure power grab? [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=973.28s)]
*  Right. I mean, I think I don't think we can write that out of the story here. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=976.9200000000001s)]
*  This is in the context of Donald Trump in all sorts of ways, kind of trying to create [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=980.28s)]
*  an even larger unitary executive theory across the government, firing independent and people [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=986.76s)]
*  in independent agencies, consolidating power. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=991.9200000000001s)]
*  Tariffs are another way to consolidate power, forcing corporations and economic actors to, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=994.48s)]
*  again, kiss the ring of the president to try to get exemptions. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1000.1600000000001s)]
*  And I go back to, you know, where is Congress here? [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1004.8000000000001s)]
*  Because to my mind, as much as this is a chaotic situation, it's a reflection of the fact [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1008.0400000000001s)]
*  that Congress has delegated so much authority to the president. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1014.76s)]
*  Tariffs are written into the into the into the Constitution as something that should [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1020.0s)]
*  be the purview that is the purview of Congress. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1025.76s)]
*  Congress has in various ways ceded that authority to presidents to wake up one morning and a [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1029.24s)]
*  president can say, I'm going to use this or that emergency power to create tariffs. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1035.04s)]
*  I would argue that one of the benefits of the way the Constitution was written was that [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1039.76s)]
*  especially in the light of the Tea Party, like the literal Tea Party, was that the founders [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1044.44s)]
*  didn't want that to happen specifically on tariff policy, that the founders wanted tariff [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1048.92s)]
*  policy to have to go through a slower process so that there was consensus around it. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1053.92s)]
*  And so my hope is that out of this, there is some effort for Congress to reclaim some [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1060.0s)]
*  of that tariff power that it's supposed to have, because at a base level, one thing is [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1065.76s)]
*  for sure, whatever tariff policy is in place needs to be consistent to create an environment [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1071.84s)]
*  for investment. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1078.08s)]
*  If a company is thinking about reshoring jobs or not reshoring jobs, one thing it wants [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1079.3999999999999s)]
*  to know, it really has to know is whether the tariff policy is going to be in place [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1084.6s)]
*  for the next two years, five years, ten years, to know whether it really should make that [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1088.8s)]
*  investment billions of dollars worth in a big factory or not. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1093.2s)]
*  Right now, the last thing we have right now, I think it's fair to say, is consistency and [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1096.52s)]
*  stability with Trump saying we're going to do tariffs, we're not going to do tariffs. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1101.9199999999998s)]
*  I think whether you're for higher tariffs, lower tariffs, free trade, not free trade, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1105.6399999999999s)]
*  the fact that it's not been consistent in this period, I don't think is very good. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1110.6s)]
*  I want to delve into that, the issue with Congress in just a second, but I just want [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1115.08s)]
*  you mentioned Ross Perot a couple of times, I just wanted to say when that 1992 election [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1118.84s)]
*  happened, which is where Ross Perot ran as a third party candidate, very well may have [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1124.8s)]
*  helped Bill Clinton get elected, I was very young, I didn't really understand free trade, [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1127.84s)]
*  but what I remember about it is the sucking sound. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1132.6799999999998s)]
*  Like that was his big kind of calling card, which was, oh, you hear that sucking sound? [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1136.28s)]
*  That's the sound of jobs being moved out of the United States to Mexico, to parts of [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1140.96s)]
*  the developing world if we do NAFTA. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1146.44s)]
*  And he was debating on that stage two hardcore free traders in Bill Clinton and George A.W. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1147.92s)]
*  Bush. If you go back and look at those debates, which I've done a couple of times, it is [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1153.0s)]
*  actually shocking how prescient he was, how much he understood exactly what was going [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1157.56s)]
*  to happen. And I remember so well at the time that the media basically depicted him as [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1163.2s)]
*  this unserious crackpot, this crazy conspiracy theorist, which is what they do to third party [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1167.88s)]
*  candidates. You had Bill Clinton and George A.W. Bush advocating policies that would destroy [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1173.16s)]
*  the country. He was the only one who foresaw that on that stage. And yet they were like, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1176.92s)]
*  oh, this guy is a lunatic, a crackpot. You can just laugh at him even though he was a [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1181.16s)]
*  billionaire and understood business very well. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1186.96s)]
*  You mentioned this thing with Congress, and it's so true, it's not just in the area of [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1191.24s)]
*  tariffs, but also like war powers, right? Like we're not supposed to ever go to war [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1194.92s)]
*  unless Congress declares war. There's federalist papers on this that, you know, if you're going [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1198.5600000000002s)]
*  to fight a war, you want to make sure that people are consenting to it through the ones [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1202.0800000000002s)]
*  closest to them, which is not the president, but their representatives in their district. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1205.5600000000002s)]
*  There's no role. Congress doesn't want any role in war. They want to leave that to the [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1209.64s)]
*  president. It's like too hard of a call. They don't want that on there. Same with tariffs, [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1213.5200000000002s)]
*  same with everything. They've kind of just abdicated, you know, any role at all. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1217.24s)]
*  That said, one thing that caught my attention was a couple days ago, you know, there's this [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1221.24s)]
*  legislation pending in both the Senate and the House to take back that power, to say [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1225.68s)]
*  the president doesn't have a right to unilaterally impose tariffs. If he does, we have the right [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1230.64s)]
*  to nullify them or approval as needed. And there was reporting that at least, you know, [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1234.28s)]
*  a dozen, maybe more House Republicans are ready to sign on to that. And that would be [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1239.48s)]
*  the first real break with Republicans and Trump. And I guess I wasn't surprised by that [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1244.92s)]
*  because the one thing that could get House Republicans to break from Trump is if their [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1250.48s)]
*  corporate donors are angry and afraid, like if their corporate donors say, you need to [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1255.0800000000002s)]
*  do something about this. That's probably the one thing that can move them. Again, I agree [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1259.52s)]
*  with you completely that we can't seguinalize Trump, but do you think that might have been [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1262.96s)]
*  a factor of the concern that the Congress is going to step in and take away some of [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1267.88s)]
*  those powers from Trump? [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1271.44s)]
*  I certainly think that's probably part of the White House's calculus, that they are [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1274.2s)]
*  getting pressure. They are hearing from Republicans. And I think you're right. Republican lawmakers [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1277.62s)]
*  are hearing from both their donors, but they're probably also hearing from their constituents [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1283.5s)]
*  who are afraid of higher prices. And I think we can't write that out of the story. I mean, [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1288.9399999999998s)]
*  Donald Trump did campaign. I mean, in some ways, he campaigned on two contradictory things, [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1293.06s)]
*  at least in the short term. There is a contradiction in saying, I am going to put in tariffs that [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1299.82s)]
*  are going to make trade fairer and saying my top priority is bringing down inflation. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1305.82s)]
*  Tariffs are inherently inflationary. Now, that doesn't mean a strategic use of tariffs [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1312.3s)]
*  isn't a good idea. That doesn't mean the inflation that if you strategically use tariffs carefully, [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1318.1399999999999s)]
*  that doesn't mean the inflation is permanent or long term. So there is a tension there. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1324.42s)]
*  Obviously, the public is sensitive to inflation for good reason. It's basically the affordability [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1329.02s)]
*  crisis. So I think Republicans are under sort of dual pressure from people worried about [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1335.7s)]
*  higher prices, their voters, their constituents, and the corporate class, which is worried [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1341.18s)]
*  about having to change its business model around a new tariff policy. And I think that [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1346.3s)]
*  here's the thing. In a sense, regardless of the motivation, I think it would be a good [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1353.98s)]
*  thing if the Congress took back some power here and frankly got into the habit of taking [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1361.26s)]
*  back power that it's supposed to have under the Constitution across the board. I don't [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1368.38s)]
*  think we want to live in a country where we perceive the president to be an elected king. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1374.14s)]
*  And there's a difference between a president and an elected king. A president is supposed [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1380.14s)]
*  to be the head of a co-equal branch of government. That wasn't incidental. It was set up that [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1384.8600000000001s)]
*  way by the founders who had lived under a king. An elected king, which I think a lot [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1390.42s)]
*  of people perceive the president to be, is basically somebody who's elected who gets [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1396.5800000000002s)]
*  to do whatever they want. I mean, we've seen the White House make this argument, oh, you [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1400.7s)]
*  know, anything Trump does is the small d democratic process because he was elected, which is not [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1404.74s)]
*  true in the sense that, yes, he was elected. But what's not true is that he wasn't elected [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1410.8200000000002s)]
*  to be the only branch of government. There were 435 other elections for a separate branch [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1417.46s)]
*  that is supposed to be a check on that power. I don't think it's a good thing for business. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1425.98s)]
*  I don't think it's a good thing for workers. I don't think it's a good thing for civil [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1430.3400000000001s)]
*  liberties, war policy, any of this, that we now live in a country where it's presumed [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1433.5800000000002s)]
*  to be normalized and acceptable for one person to wake up on a given day and radically change [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1437.8600000000001s)]
*  a policy across the board without any consensus from the other 435 people who were elected [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1444.14s)]
*  in 435 separate elections. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1451.14s)]
*  1775 and rumble have teamed up to launch the first anti-Asian coffee and it's almost gone. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1454.8600000000001s)]
*  They dropped 1000 longevity bundles and after blowing through most of them, they extended [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMAk2zCR58&t=1462.94s)]
