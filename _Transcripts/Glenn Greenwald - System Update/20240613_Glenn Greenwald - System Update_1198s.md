# Dangerous Calls to Capture Moscow Escalate as Western Derangement About Russia Grows
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [June 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0)
*  All right, one of the topics that I have covered most over the last five years is the obsession [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=0.0s)]
*  that has been deliberately cultivated inside the United States with viewing Russia not [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=12.64s)]
*  just as an adversary or even an enemy but an existential threat to the United States. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=17.76s)]
*  And it's been very bizarre to watch the trajectory of this because if you go back to the very [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=22.12s)]
*  first president who dealt with Vladimir Putin, which was Bill Clinton, and then go through [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=27.28s)]
*  every president after that, George W. Bush and then Barack Obama and then Donald Trump, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=32.64s)]
*  as well as a wide range of diplomats and secretaries of state, they always said the same [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=39.6s)]
*  thing, which is Vladimir Putin is a rational, constrained actor in the world that you can deal [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=46.24s)]
*  with him, that you can make deals with him, that he's very wise, very smart, very shrewd, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=52.0s)]
*  and basically takes rational actions to protect Russian interests. Never once did any of these [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=57.68s)]
*  people, these presidents or diplomats, ever claim that he was some kind of genocidal monster, some [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=63.68s)]
*  Hitler figure, some psychopath. That all appeared overnight. And it happened for two reasons. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=69.6s)]
*  One, that many Americans were convinced that the reason Donald Trump won in 2016, defeated [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=77.36s)]
*  Hillary Clinton, was because of the Kremlin. And so they learned to really hate Vladimir Putin [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=84.80000000000001s)]
*  and Moscow again because they were convinced that that was the reason Hillary lost. But the other [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=92.24000000000001s)]
*  reason, the related one, was the Russiagate fraud. And my biggest breach, my first breach with, let's [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=97.68s)]
*  call it the left, my most serious breach, took place in the middle of 2016 and then for the next [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=104.39999999999999s)]
*  several years when I immediately started doubting and heaping a lot of skeptical scorn on this [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=111.27999999999999s)]
*  Russiagate narrative that I knew was coming from the CIA and the FBI. And one of my main concerns [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=117.52s)]
*  was that it was just fake. Journalistically, there was no evidence to demonstrate the core claims, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=122.88s)]
*  as Robert Mueller ended up concluding. But the other concern I had was that it was creating a [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=128.72s)]
*  very dangerous environment between the two, world's two largest nuclear powers, to the point where any [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=136.0s)]
*  conversations between American officials on the one hand and Russian officials on the other [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=142.24s)]
*  were deemed treasonous virtually. And it created a climate where no American official wanted even [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=147.44s)]
*  to talk to Russian officials. Jeff Sessions had too trivial in passing conversations with Russian [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=154.16s)]
*  officials when he was in the Senate. By then he was Trump's attorney general and they tried to put [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=161.68s)]
*  him in prison over it. They put, they charged Michael Flynn with felonies because he was the [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=165.92s)]
*  national security advisor incoming in the transition for picking up the phone and calling [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=171.51999999999998s)]
*  the Russian ambassador to the United States to try and create good relations, what has always [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=175.92s)]
*  been done during the transition. So the climate that was created was a very dangerous one. It [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=179.68s)]
*  insisted that Russia was our grave enemy and that it was somehow even treasonous to talk to the [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=184.32s)]
*  Russians. And you can see that it had not only a domestic political aim but also a geostrategic [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=189.28s)]
*  one, a geopolitical one coming from the U.S. security state to turn Russia back into a hardcore [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=195.92000000000002s)]
*  American enemy. And I would suggest you could draw a straight line from that narrative to all of the [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=200.88s)]
*  anti-Russian phobia inside both the established the established wings of both parties to the war [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=208.4s)]
*  in Ukraine and now that it appears likely, almost I would say inevitable, that there's no way that [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=215.84s)]
*  the U.S. and NATO can win this war as they defined victory at the start which was expelling every [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=223.04000000000002s)]
*  Russian troop from every inch of Ukrainian territory including Crimea. If anything the Russians [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=227.52s)]
*  are gaining more territory as we go along. People are getting more and more desperate. We've talked [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=233.28s)]
*  about Emmanuel Macron openly and repeatedly talking about the potential to deploy NATO troops [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=237.36s)]
*  as combat soldiers to fight against the Russian army inside Ukraine. The Biden administration for [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=244.24s)]
*  the first time just permitted the Ukrainians to use American provided missiles and other weapons [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=250.88000000000002s)]
*  to strike Russians inside Russia on Russian soil. This is all escalating still in a very dangerous [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=258.0s)]
*  way. And just to illustrate just how far away we are from anything even remotely rational, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=265.76s)]
*  I want to show you a discussion that the Free Press which is Barry Weiss's media outlet [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=272.32s)]
*  published and produced. It was on Barry Weiss's podcast which I believe is called Honestly. I [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=279.59999999999997s)]
*  believe that's the name of the podcast or Honestly Speaking. And the guest host was Michael Moynihan. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=285.36s)]
*  He's been around for a while. He used to work at Vice. He hosted his own podcast. He's a fanatical [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=291.84s)]
*  supporter of aggressive war hawk policy in general but Israel in particular. That's obviously a [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=299.52s)]
*  prerequisite to working at the Free Press as somebody whose views are published. And he was [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=305.44s)]
*  speaking to a Russian dissident Ilya Potomarov who is a former member of the Russian Duma but has [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=313.28s)]
*  turned into one of those kind of dissidents like you know we heard from all those Iraqi dissidents [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=321.04s)]
*  in the run-up to the Iraqi war assuring Americans that it would be extremely easy to topple Saddam [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=326.88s)]
*  Hussein that we would be welcomed as liberators. These dissidents who laughed who don't speak for [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=333.36s)]
*  the people but you know we hear from Iranian dissidents all the time who say the same thing. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=338.8s)]
*  So listen to this conversation that Barry Weiss's news site promoted about how easily the United [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=342.56s)]
*  States could facilitate a coup in Russia and then how we could take Moscow. Just listen to [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=350.64s)]
*  how detached from reality but how incredibly dangerous this is. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=356.4s)]
*  You have a leader in Vladimir Putin who has effectively shut down all opposition media, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=362.88s)]
*  controls the courts, the judiciary's entire... By the way that's all true of Vladimir Zelensky as [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=368.4s)]
*  well. He has shut down opposition media. He controls the courts. Any dissent from him result [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=374.24s)]
*  in prison has happened with the American citizen Zalir who died in prison. They suspended elections. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=379.6s)]
*  Zelensky is the president of Ukraine indefinitely but we don't talk about that because Ukraine is [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=385.52000000000004s)]
*  our ally. We only pretend to be concerned about that sort of thing when it's our enemy which is [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=392.16s)]
*  Russia. Really in the hands of the state invades countries you know participates in the 500, 600 [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=397.28000000000003s)]
*  thousand dead in Syria, can poison people multiple times, can assassinate them in foreign countries [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=407.2s)]
*  and no one does a thing. By the way the United States also invades other countries. The United [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=414.32s)]
*  States assassinates people in other countries with no due process. No one does a thing. These people [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=422.4s)]
*  are so drowning in nationalistic propaganda that I don't... I mean Mike Moynihan I know him [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=429.2s)]
*  reasonably well. I've been on that podcast a couple times. I think I've met him a few times, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=436.24s)]
*  talked to him. He's a reasonably smart person. It's just that they get so blinded by propaganda [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=439.36s)]
*  that he can say all these things about what Putin does without realizing that Zelensky does the same [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=446.32s)]
*  things, without realizing the United States does the same things far more than Russia does when it [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=450.64s)]
*  comes to invading other countries, bombing other countries, killing people around the world including [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=455.04s)]
*  American citizens as happened under President Obama where he claimed the right to assassinate [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=458.88s)]
*  by drone even American citizens with no due process and then carried that out twice in Yemen [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=462.72s)]
*  where he killed two American citizens. And see that's how you get a lot of these deranged [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=468.08000000000004s)]
*  conclusions is by beginning with a world that is completely made up and is just trenched with [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=475.44000000000005s)]
*  propagandistic blindness. I mean how do you dislodge a person like that when the international [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=482.64000000000004s)]
*  community kind of shrugs their shoulders and says you know we can supply Ukraine with weapons but [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=488.08000000000004s)]
*  even that comes up against resistance in most western countries? You know yes there is a problem [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=492.16s)]
*  because many countries and first of all is the United States are very shy to support this Russian [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=499.44s)]
*  resistance. They find gazillion different excuses why it shouldn't be done. Okay remember how we're [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=509.28000000000003s)]
*  always told that one of the worst things that ever happened was that the Russians interfered [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=516.88s)]
*  in our domestic politics. Think about what they're saying what they're angry about which is that the [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=521.6s)]
*  United States is too cautious, too reluctant to go arm and fund and finance opponents to Vladimir Putin [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=526.88s)]
*  inside Russia. So we're supposed to go and massively interfere in their politics but if they produce a [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=535.36s)]
*  few Russian Facebook bots and a few fake Twitter accounts this is a grave assault on everything decent. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=540.32s)]
*  And by the way it's amazing to say that we're reluctant to interfere in Russia since you can find a Thai magazine [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=547.52s)]
*  cover story when the fall of the Soviet Union happened and Russia and the Russians had an election and Boris Yeltsin, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=554.88s)]
*  a good friend of the west, was elected and the time magazine celebrated the cover on his cover story the fact that [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=562.96s)]
*  it was Americans responsible for his election that we facilitated his election. But even more recently [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=568.88s)]
*  one of the reasons Vladimir Putin hates Hillary Clinton is because when Hillary Clinton was secretary of state under President Obama [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=575.04s)]
*  they openly funded opposition groups to Vladimir Putin openly through things like the National Endowment of Democracy [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=584.0s)]
*  which is a fund that the United States government uses supposedly to promote democracy as if that's our aim in the world. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=592.0799999999999s)]
*  That's designed to do not interference in other countries through fake Facebook pages or Twitter bots [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=597.8399999999999s)]
*  but by financing opposition groups and riling them up like we did in Ukraine to overthrow the elected [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=605.1999999999999s)]
*  president in 2014 and he's complaining we don't do enough of that inside Russia that we should be [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=611.28s)]
*  controlling and manipulating domestic Russian politics even more but it gets so much worse. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=618.08s)]
*  Yeah the government's not going to meet with you. You know we meet in private with a lot of different people [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=624.48s)]
*  but not officially and they're very much afraid of showing and expressing any public support. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=630.4s)]
*  They like people who do like human rights things you know maybe a little bit of counter propaganda [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=638.88s)]
*  but those who have a real role in actual resisting and fighting for freedom no that's you know they [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=646.24s)]
*  they prefer to keep out. So according to him the United States government is very happy [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=653.4399999999999s)]
*  to interfere in Russia by pushing human rights narratives by engaging in counter propaganda [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=659.2s)]
*  meaning spreading all kinds of agitation and riling up the Russian population against Putin. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=665.92s)]
*  The exact thing that we claim we were so offended by when they did to us in the 2016 campaign he's [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=673.44s)]
*  saying no the US government is very happy to do that out in the open and even for those of us who [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=678.64s)]
*  meet who engage in real resistance against Putin which as you're about to learn means [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=684.48s)]
*  that they want to overthrow him in a violent coup. He's saying the US government will meet with us [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=689.6800000000001s)]
*  in private they just don't want to meet with us out in the open they don't want to admit that they are [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=694.32s)]
*  working with people who want to facilitate regime change and a coup against the president of the [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=699.28s)]
*  country with the largest nuclear stockpile in the world. This is the mentality that you're hearing here. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=705.52s)]
*  The regime is actually way more fragile than it actually looks and if you saw the mutiny that was [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=712.08s)]
*  done by Evgeny Prigozhin that's the illustration of my words. I know many people in Washington DC [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=721.44s)]
*  after that happened I was saying this all the time that if you have 5,000 armed untrained people you [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=727.28s)]
*  can actually go and capture Moscow and say ah it's a fantasy you know. Okay listen to this rationale [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=733.04s)]
*  he's saying that all you need are 5,000 armed people to take over Moscow overthrow the Russian [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=738.56s)]
*  government and his proof of that his proof of theory is what happened with the Wagner group and [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=744.56s)]
*  Prigozhin. Now just to remind you of what actually happened there when Prigozhin did his little [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=751.04s)]
*  rebellion his little insurrection that wasn't even named to Putin really but it was aimed at the [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=758.0799999999999s)]
*  defense officials whom he had decided were constraining him in Ukraine. He had 25,000 [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=764.0799999999999s)]
*  not just armed men but highly trained soldiers I mean these were people who were working for him [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=773.28s)]
*  as mercenaries who were extremely good fighters. The people under Prigozhin were the ones who had [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=778.9599999999999s)]
*  some of Russia's most important victories in Ukraine. These were hardcore fighters [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=784.0799999999999s)]
*  and he didn't have 5,000 of them he had 25,000 of them and although I remember so well when it [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=788.88s)]
*  happened pretty much every alleged Russian expert and fake Russian expert in the United States on [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=796.0s)]
*  social media and in Europe were acting as though this was the end of the Putin government that [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=802.8s)]
*  this was a real coup. The Russian government crushed that in 12 hours by the time you woke [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=809.36s)]
*  up the next morning there was no more rebellion there was no more insurrection [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=815.6800000000001s)]
*  and then Prigozhin of course ended up dead two months later and they crushed it like that [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=820.72s)]
*  and you'd be like saying oh all you need is 5,000 people to march into [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=827.12s)]
*  Washington and all you need is 5,000 armed people you can take over the government you can overthrow [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=830.96s)]
*  Biden enter the White House seize that's how insane that is Russia is a major military power [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=834.96s)]
*  even more so now than they were two years ago when they ended up in a proxy war with all NATO [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=841.52s)]
*  but this is the kind of thing we heard before the Iraq war oh don't worry you just go in everyone [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=849.76s)]
*  hates it on Hussein the minute you're there the whole population will turn against him [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=853.6s)]
*  they're very they're way more fragile than you think and we ended up stuck there for over a decade [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=857.68s)]
*  with thousands of our own soldiers and over a million Iraqis ending up dying from that conflict [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=862.4s)]
*  again this is what Barry Weiss's media outlet her podcast called honestly speaking is promoting [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=867.9200000000001s)]
*  he's saying the proof that all you need is 5,000 people is what happened with Prigozhin what [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=877.12s)]
*  happened with Prigozhin was he had 25,000 extremely well-trained fighters and very they [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=881.44s)]
*  they took a Russian helicopter out of the sky that's how sophisticated and well armed they were [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=886.08s)]
*  well armed they were and within 12 hours they didn't exist anymore [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=891.1999999999999s)]
*  you are dreaming and when they saw it they actually called me and said Ilya looks like [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=898.48s)]
*  you have a proof of your concept you know it there it is honestly with Barry Weiss [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=904.56s)]
*  people called him after the Prigozhin coup that lasted barely 12 hours with five times the number [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=910.0s)]
*  of soldiers that he says he needs to perpetrate a coup inside Moscow and someone apparently told [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=916.48s)]
*  him this is proof of your concept as if that coup succeeded but I think the more important [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=923.44s)]
*  point here is that if you are a minimally sane person the idea that you think the United States [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=929.12s)]
*  should perpetrate a coup inside Russia and overthrow the government of Vladimir Putin and [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=937.9200000000001s)]
*  that's what Michael Moynihan was saying he was saying how do we get rid of this guy what do we [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=943.2s)]
*  need to do to get rid of this guy obviously the international community won't yeah you know why [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=947.6s)]
*  they won't because it's unbelievably insane to even muse on the possibility let alone contemplate [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=950.8s)]
*  a plan for overthrowing Vladimir Putin in part because again they have the largest stockpile of [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=959.52s)]
*  nuclear weapons on the planet but also precisely because of that you have no idea who would come [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=967.44s)]
*  next after Putin who would then take over after Putin and why would anyone want to roll the dice [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=975.5200000000001s)]
*  as I said Putin for 25 years has obviously been a responsible steward of the nuclear [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=983.5200000000001s)]
*  arsenal that Russia is sitting on because there's been no use of nuclear weapons [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=988.8800000000001s)]
*  and every president if you go back before Biden and look at what they said about Putin and the [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=994.24s)]
*  government's position was about Putin you'll all hear the same thing as I said so the fact that [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=999.2s)]
*  anybody with any kind of platform let alone one on this Barry Weiss site can seriously sit there and [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=1004.4s)]
*  talk about how the U.S. government should be doing more to overthrow the Russian government should [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=1010.08s)]
*  overthrow Vladimir Putin in a coup that the United States openly finances arms and supports [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=1014.48s)]
*  is a level of insanity that is hard to describe but I think it's such an important the reason why [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=1021.04s)]
*  I wanted to show you this is because I you know you go back in the cold war and fear of nuclear [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=1026.8s)]
*  war was a driving factor and that's because we should fear a nuclear war it will end the species [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=1033.04s)]
*  it will end the war it will end the world the United States and the Soviet Union came very close [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=1039.04s)]
*  came very close on at least two occasions of blowing up the entire world through their use [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=1045.04s)]
*  of their nuclear arsenals and everything the United States did in the cold war and everything [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=1050.72s)]
*  the Soviet Union did in the cold war was about trying to ensure whether it was through miscommunication [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=1056.24s)]
*  or misperception or unintended escalation that the countries didn't end up in a nuclear conflict [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=1062.08s)]
*  unintentionally and it succeeded though barely talking about these are like little kids playing [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=1068.32s)]
*  with you know like a machine gun and thinking it's funny we have completely lost the fear of [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=1074.24s)]
*  nuclear weapons even though the kind we have now were infinitely more powerful than the ones that [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=1082.16s)]
*  almost blew up the world during the Cuban Missile Crisis and during the cold war Trump talks about [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=1087.52s)]
*  that a lot he was obviously affected when he got briefings about what these weapons are and what [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=1091.6s)]
*  they will do talks about that a lot and obviously that's of course true but we are so [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=1096.8s)]
*  drowning in this this kind of antipathy toward Moscow and to this view that Russia is the supreme [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=1107.76s)]
*  enemy as though they're a threat to our country and to our way of life and to our government [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=1114.96s)]
*  as if it's 1957 that is not just that people want to go to war with Russia there'd be a lot of people [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=1119.6s)]
*  there are a lot of people wanting a lot more U.S. involvement in Ukraine against Russia it's that [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=1126.88s)]
*  they scoff at this point at the fear of nuclear weapons in fact there were articles written in [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=1132.16s)]
*  places like the Atlantic trying to claim we don't need to worry about nuclear weapons there's a [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=1136.96s)]
*  survivable nuclear war there are limits to nuclear war that would probably happen it wouldn't destroy [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=1141.0400000000002s)]
*  the entire species but can't be blackmailed by it any longer I mean this conversation though it seems [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=1147.68s)]
*  like it's a kind of rational and reasonable one because the way they're talking and the place on [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=1154.0s)]
*  which they're the platform on which they're talking is a kind of insanity that I would suggest to you [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=1158.64s)]
*  is beyond dangerous and is much more pervasive in the United States than we typically realize [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=1163.44s)]
*  because of how normalized it's become. Thanks for watching this clip from System Update our live [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1kKUDN4M0&t=1169.04s)]
