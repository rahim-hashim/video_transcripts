# "Free-Market" Frauds EXPOSED
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [May 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4)
*  There's an issue that is going on throughout the country that has gotten very little attention, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=0.0s)]
*  even though I think it deserves quite a lot. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=12.72s)]
*  And it involves the pattern of red state governors, Republican governors, who have long heralded [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  themselves as believers in the free market. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=24.32s)]
*  The government doesn't intervene and tell you what you can do and what you can eat. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=27.92s)]
*  It's not a nanny state. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=32.52s)]
*  It's not there to take care of you and force you to do things that they think is healthy. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=33.52s)]
*  It's about an economy that allows competition, free competition in the marketplace, so that [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=39.32s)]
*  consumers can decide which they want and let the best company or best product win. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=44.760000000000005s)]
*  And yet, because people are starting to realize how repulsive factory farming is, how morally [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=52.42s)]
*  repulsive in terms of the breeding of billions of animals, sentient animals, complex, socially [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=60.86s)]
*  complex and very smart animals, who they torture for years before leaving them in the slaughterhouse [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=67.62s)]
*  that bred just to be factory farm animals, they never go outside. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=72.3s)]
*  The only time they ever see out the outdoors is when they are put on the truck to the slaughterhouse. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=75.62s)]
*  And we've talked many times before about how morally reprehensible it is to subject these [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=81.54s)]
*  majestic animals, beautiful animals. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=91.14s)]
*  Family farming has always been about killing the animal at the end to make food, but along [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=94.38000000000001s)]
*  the way, family farms, the family farm value is you treat your animals very well. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=98.86000000000001s)]
*  It keeps them healthier and happier, and that has always been part of the, you don't torture [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=103.44000000000001s)]
*  your animals on a family farm. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=108.06s)]
*  But in industrial factory farming, that's what it's all about. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=109.74000000000001s)]
*  It's industrial. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=113.26s)]
*  It has nothing to do with farming, actually. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=114.26s)]
*  We call it factory farms. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=116.26s)]
*  It doesn't resemble a farm at all. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=117.46000000000001s)]
*  And in fact, it's destroying family farms. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=119.26s)]
*  But this is a very powerful industry, very powerful. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=122.5s)]
*  They spread money to every governor of every red state where they exist, and then those [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=126.06s)]
*  governors turn around and say, you know what, we're deeply concerned that people are starting [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=132.22s)]
*  to be disgusted by factory farms, not just morally, but also in terms of the health risks. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=137.62s)]
*  These factory farms are filled with disease because of how these animals are kept. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=144.42000000000002s)]
*  They're pumped full of antibiotics, which can easily create an antibiotic resistant [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=149.82000000000002s)]
*  infection or virus that can spread into a pandemic. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=155.70000000000002s)]
*  The dumping is extremely hazardous. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=162.70000000000002s)]
*  People finally are realizing how repulsive factory farms are. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=164.86s)]
*  And so, but at the same time, not everyone wants to be vegan and just give up meat. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=168.5s)]
*  So there's this middle ground where you can now take animals and just take certain cells [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=174.70000000000002s)]
*  from their body and then replicate it in a lab. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=180.46s)]
*  You cultivate the cells, you replicate it, you nourish it, and then it turns into meat [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=182.70000000000002s)]
*  because it's taking the cells, the foundation of meat. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=187.18s)]
*  You don't have to cut down zillions of trees and deforest the planet to make room for cows [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=190.42000000000002s)]
*  or have huge numbers of cows whose farting actually causes a great deal of environmental [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=197.94s)]
*  destruction. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=204.58s)]
*  And most of all, you don't have to breed billions of animals and then kill them because you're [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=205.58s)]
*  just taking their cells. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=211.1s)]
*  Now, you don't have to be somebody who finds that appealing. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=212.1s)]
*  You can buy factory farm meat. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=217.9s)]
*  No one's trying to prevent you from doing that despite all the studies showing how unhealthy [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=219.3s)]
*  it is. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=223.02s)]
*  I think that's your choice. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=224.02s)]
*  If you want to eat Doritos or sodas all day long, chocolate, McDonald's and fast food, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=225.02s)]
*  whatever. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=233.74s)]
*  I'm not here to make those dietary choices for you and nor should the government be. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=234.74s)]
*  But the same is true for people who want to eat lab-grown meat. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=240.14000000000001s)]
*  And there's companies that have been exploding wildly because they like the taste of it. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=244.92s)]
*  And the studies all show that it's very safe. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=250.72s)]
*  It's been approved by the FDA. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=254.2s)]
*  It's been approved by food agencies in many other countries, including Singapore and Israel, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=255.88s)]
*  which led the way, and now places in Europe as well. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=259.59999999999997s)]
*  But what's so important to note here is that when these red state governors are banning [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=265.21999999999997s)]
*  the consuming of lab-grown meat, they're not even claiming a health concern. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=273.6s)]
*  They're not saying we're banning it because we think it's unhealthy. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=278.98s)]
*  Because they can't. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=284.02000000000004s)]
*  There's no science to support that. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=285.02000000000004s)]
*  That's why it's been approved. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=286.34000000000003s)]
*  That's not even their claim. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=287.34000000000003s)]
*  If you think, oh yeah, lab-grown meat should be banned because it's unhealthy, that seems [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=288.34000000000003s)]
*  a little bit nanny status to me. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=294.18s)]
*  I mean, I could start a campaign tomorrow saying ban McDonald's or fast food because [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=295.8s)]
*  it's very unhealthy. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=299.26000000000005s)]
*  Studies show that. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=300.32000000000005s)]
*  Generally, we don't ban food that other people want to consume based on that. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=301.32s)]
*  But in this case, that's not even what's claimed by any of these governors. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=305.24s)]
*  They're admitting the reason they want to ban lab-grown meat is to protect the meat [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=309.5s)]
*  industry, meat producers in their state. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=315.62s)]
*  In other words, helping that industry, which often funds these governors and these legislatures, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=319.0s)]
*  by banning their competition. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=325.44s)]
*  So yeah, an industry will thrive if you have the government making it a crime, as these [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=328.32s)]
*  bills do, for consumers to buy any competing products. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=332.18s)]
*  I don't know how anyone could possibly justify this. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=336.94s)]
*  Here's Montana Governor Greg Gianfort, who's become the newest governor of five or six [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=341.74s)]
*  different Republican states. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=349.58s)]
*  He announced on Twitter, quote, so-called lab-grown meat has no place in Montana. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=352.21999999999997s)]
*  By signing HB 401 into law, I am proud to defend our way of life and the hardworking [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=357.98s)]
*  Montana ranchers who produce the best beef in the world. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=363.36s)]
*  I never realized before that the Montana way of life was to have the state dictate to people [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=367.72s)]
*  what food they could and can and can't consume. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=375.18s)]
*  In fact, Montana is not just a deeply red state. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=377.84000000000003s)]
*  It's one of the most libertarian states. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=380.70000000000005s)]
*  It has that ethos of the Northwest, states like Idaho as well, that we don't want the [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=383.06s)]
*  federal government or any government coming in and telling us what we can and can't do. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=390.88s)]
*  Let the free market decide that. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=394.96s)]
*  Here's the official release of the State of Montana newsroom, the title of which was Governor [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=397.4s)]
*  Gianfort Bans Lab-Grown Meat in Montana. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=402.62s)]
*  And I want you to listen to what they say is the reason and what they don't say is the [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=405.18s)]
*  reason for this. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=409.14s)]
*  Because when I talked about this on social media and a zillion people coming and saying, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=410.88s)]
*  lab-grown meat is not healthy, I just, I couldn't get through the message. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=414.58s)]
*  This is not even the claim that the governor is making when banning it. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=419.54s)]
*  One of the things that drives me crazy, it always has, is when citizens want to defend [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=425.48s)]
*  some politician's actions and they invent excuses or rationale to defend it that not [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=431.02s)]
*  even the politician himself is claiming. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=436.14s)]
*  That's not the purpose of this law to ban unhealthy food. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=441.0s)]
*  They don't even claim it's unhealthy. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=443.2s)]
*  Governor Gianfort Bans Lab-Grown Meat in Montana, quote, Montana Farm Bureau celebrates the [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=447.08s)]
*  governor signing House Bill 401. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=451.91999999999996s)]
*  That's the association of meat producers. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=455.8s)]
*  Sponsored by Representative Braxton Mitchell, a Republican from Columbia Falls, House Bill [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=460.0s)]
*  401 prohibits the manufacture for sale, sale or the distribution of cell-cultured edible [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=464.14s)]
*  products. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=468.82s)]
*  The bill defines cell-cultured edible products as, quote, the concept of meat, including [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=470.0s)]
*  but not limited to muscle cells, fat cells, connective tissue, blood, and other components [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=474.46s)]
*  produced via cell culture rather than from a whole slaughtered animal. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=478.9s)]
*  That's what they're protecting, the industry that mass slaughters animals. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=485.14s)]
*  Why don't they have to compete like every other industry? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=491.74s)]
*  Starting October 1st, any retail food establishment in Montana that manufactures, sells or distributes [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=496.24s)]
*  cell-cultured edible products is subject to suspension of their license and could be found [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=502.32s)]
*  guilty of a misdemeanor and faced with fines and imprisonment. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=507.04s)]
*  Imprisonment if convicted. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=512.36s)]
*  Quote, as chairman of the House Agriculture Committee and someone whose family has been [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=513.64s)]
*  involved in Montana's meat processing industry for over 80 years, I'm proud the governor [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=518.36s)]
*  signed House Bill 401 into law. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=523.22s)]
*  Representative Mitchell said, quote, agriculture is our state's number one industry and this [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=526.1s)]
*  bill takes a clear stand to protect our ranchers and food supply. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=530.5s)]
*  We won't let synthetic products with misleading labels undercut the hard work of Montana's [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=536.0600000000001s)]
*  farm and ranch families. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=540.3000000000001s)]
*  The Montana Farm Bureau Federation praised the signing of the legislation thanking the [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=543.1s)]
*  governor and legislatures for defending and protecting the Montana way of life. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=546.82s)]
*  Quote, Montana ranchers grow some of the best meat in the world. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=550.62s)]
*  We are thrilled consumers in the treasure state will continue to enjoy authentic meat. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=553.8000000000001s)]
*  Thank you to the legislature and Governor John Ford for supporting ranchers and consumers [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=558.8000000000001s)]
*  with this new law. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=563.44s)]
*  Said Montana Farm Bureau Federation President Cindy Johnson. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=564.44s)]
*  So they're admitting, they're admitting that this is only done to protect the industry [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=567.48s)]
*  that funds them from having to compete with any other possible alternatives to their food. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=574.4000000000001s)]
*  They're saying, oh, because of this law, Montana's residents will continue to enjoy high quality [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=581.1600000000001s)]
*  meat produced the way they've always produced it by slaughtering huge numbers of animals. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=587.1400000000001s)]
*  Without this bill, they could enjoy that meat. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=592.7800000000001s)]
*  They could still buy that meat if they want it. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=597.0s)]
*  The difference is they could also buy alternatives to meat. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=599.86s)]
*  Again, that have been approved by the FDA. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=602.84s)]
*  That's where food approval takes place and medication approval takes place is on the [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=604.6400000000001s)]
*  federal level. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=608.72s)]
*  And it's a very rigorous process to approve new foods. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=609.72s)]
*  And as I said, it's not just the United States, but many other serious countries that have [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=613.46s)]
*  approved this as well. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=618.94s)]
*  Here's an article from Reason in, and by the way, yeah, I should also say that, as I said, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=625.1s)]
*  this is not the first state that's done it. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=632.18s)]
*  North Carolina has done this, has banned lab-grown meat. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=634.5799999999999s)]
*  So has Alabama and so has Florida. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=638.0799999999999s)]
*  And our guest tonight, who's Emma Camp, the associate editor of Reason, has written extensively [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=642.0s)]
*  about that. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=647.14s)]
*  And she'll be here shortly to talk about it, which is when we go through a little bit. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=648.14s)]
*  Here from Reason, March 2025, North Carolina is the latest state to try to restrict lab-grown [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=651.8s)]
*  meat. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=657.4599999999999s)]
*  Lab-grown meat isn't challenging slaughtered meat anytime soon, but states keep trying [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=658.78s)]
*  to restrict competition. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=663.4s)]
*  That's the other thing. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=666.28s)]
*  If lab-grown meat is so disgusting, you think, and you think it's so horrible and nobody [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=667.28s)]
*  would want to eat it, that's all the more reason why you don't have to ban it. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=670.1s)]
*  If everybody really wants to eat meat through slaughtered animals, they can. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=675.14s)]
*  Why not let the free market decide? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=678.56s)]
*  Why not let people who want to buy lab-grown meat make their own choices about their diet? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=679.9s)]
*  Would you want the state coming in and looking at your diet and deciding what parts they [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=684.3399999999999s)]
*  think are unhealthy and most Americans have a lot of unhealthy food in their diet and [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=688.08s)]
*  saying, this is banned, this is banned, this cannot be sold in any stores. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=692.08s)]
*  If a store sells Doritos or Coke, then it will be subject to fines and the loss of its [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=696.32s)]
*  license and even imprisonment. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=706.2s)]
*  So now you're a citizen, an adult citizen, you've always eaten that food, you want to [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=709.0400000000001s)]
*  go to the store and buy it, but the state says, sorry, you can't eat this food in our [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=712.2800000000001s)]
*  state. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=715.8000000000001s)]
*  People would be screaming bloody murder, especially conservatives who have screamed bloody murder [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=717.18s)]
*  at far less intrusive attempts than this, but because it has become kind of an ethos [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=723.6999999999999s)]
*  in conservative politics to love meat, venerating meat, which is fine, venerate meat all you [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=731.2199999999999s)]
*  want, a lot of people just reflectively reacted this, like yee-hawt, animal slaughtered meat [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=737.14s)]
*  is way better than lab-grown meat, which is fine to think that, but how you then get to [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=744.34s)]
*  this non-secret or that therefore the state should ban the food I dislike for anyone to [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=748.38s)]
*  use is just mystifying. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=752.1s)]
*  Here from reason in May of 2024, one year ago, Alabama governor signs bill banning lab-grown [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=755.66s)]
*  meat. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=761.3s)]
*  Lab-grown meat bans don't protect consumers, but they do protect ranchers and farmers from [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=762.3s)]
*  competition. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=766.62s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=767.62s)]
*  That's what this is all about. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=768.62s)]
*  It's pure corporate corruption, pouring money into the coffers of state legislators and [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=769.98s)]
*  governors and then getting bills that ban their competition. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=774.78s)]
*  So they essentially have a monopoly. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=779.94s)]
*  The only choice you have is if you want to eat meat, is meat from factory farms. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=780.94s)]
*  Here from reason also a year ago, May 2024, Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida, signs [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=786.98s)]
*  a bill banning lab-grown meat in Florida. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=790.9s)]
*  While the government framed the legislation as necessary to protect Floridians from the [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=793.38s)]
*  quote global elite, he's the real authoritarian. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=797.6999999999999s)]
*  And I should note, none of these governors, including DeSantis, even pretended to be banning [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=802.1s)]
*  lab-grown meat due to health concerns. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=806.66s)]
*  They all admitted like the Montana governor did as we just showed you, that the only purpose [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=808.42s)]
*  of this is to protect the meat industry from competition. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=812.14s)]
*  Now there is no evidence, by the way, of health risks from eating lab-grown meat. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=820.4599999999999s)]
*  There's a ton of evidence about how sick red meat can make you if you consume it in excess. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=824.74s)]
*  Heart disease, strokes, and all kinds of coronary problems, diabetes, especially from other [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=831.4200000000001s)]
*  junk food as well. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=839.4200000000001s)]
*  But there are no studies, and the studies that exist say that lab-grown meat is safe, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=842.86s)]
*  which is why the USDA approved it. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=848.1400000000001s)]
*  Here from ABC News, June of 2023, USDA approves first-ever quote cell-cultivated meat for [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=850.1800000000001s)]
*  two American manufacturers. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=855.94s)]
*  Upside will cultivate and sell chicken grown from animal cells in bioreactors. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=858.86s)]
*  After years of research and rigorous testing, cell-cultivated meat will officially become [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=864.22s)]
*  part of the U.S. food system. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=868.7s)]
*  Emeryville, California based manufacturer Upside, which gave ABC News a look inside [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=871.3000000000001s)]
*  its facilities earlier this year, and Good Meat, a cultivated meat division of the plant-based [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=876.54s)]
*  egg substitute food technology company Eatjust, are the first USDA, U.S. Department of Agriculture [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=880.86s)]
*  approved cell-cultivated chicken meat produced and has been fully approved by U.S. government [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=887.22s)]
*  for commercial sales nationwide. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=892.22s)]
*  And we get to that with Emma as well. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=894.42s)]
*  There's a constitutional clause called the Interstate Commerce Clause that's designed [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=898.34s)]
*  to make sure states are engaged in protectionism against other states. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=904.62s)]
*  The idea is we're supposed to have an economy where all states have the same interstate [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=908.62s)]
*  commerce and one state can't, say, ban all products from any other state in order to [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=913.2199999999999s)]
*  protect Florida the way the U.S. can and is doing now with tariffs. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=919.5799999999999s)]
*  It's against, it's a violation of the Constitution. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=923.62s)]
*  Just to give you one example of some of these studies from the Library of Congress September [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=927.4599999999999s)]
*  of 2023, cell-cultivated meat, an overview. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=931.74s)]
*  First approvals on Upside Food and Good Meat on November 16, 2022, the FDA completed its [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=936.46s)]
*  first pre-market consultation with Upside Food for a cell-cultivated meat product for [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=941.78s)]
*  human consumption. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=946.62s)]
*  Upside Food submitted information to the FDA on its process to develop coal-sultivated [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=948.66s)]
*  chicken. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=953.98s)]
*  The FDA evaluated the company's production process, including taking cells from chickens [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=954.98s)]
*  and establishing cell banks, manufacturing control for the controlled environments, and [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=958.52s)]
*  the inputs that would be added to the controlled environment. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=962.48s)]
*  The FDA stated that after our careful evaluation of the data and information shared by the [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=964.68s)]
*  firm, we have no further questions at this time about the firm's safety conclusions. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=970.24s)]
*  On March 21, 2023, the FDA completed its second pre-market consultations for good meat. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=975.86s)]
*  On its process to develop cell-cultivated chicken, the FDA evaluated the materials submitted [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=981.3199999999999s)]
*  by Good Meat and determined it had no further questions about the company's safety conclusions. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=986.0400000000001s)]
*  But as I said, safety conclusions, safety issues are what? [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=992.0400000000001s)]
*  People who support these bills are now trying to raise retroactively to justify it. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=998.44s)]
*  None of these governors is pretending it's about health concerns. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=1001.72s)]
*  They're not saying lab-grown meat isn't healthy. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=1004.08s)]
*  They're saying we need to do this to make sure that this factory farm industrial meat [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=1006.1600000000001s)]
*  providers in our state are protected by eliminating all the competition by making it a criminal [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=1012.12s)]
*  offense to consume competition. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=1017.12s)]
*  The fact that it's coming from a party that has long claimed to be the party of free market [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=1019.3199999999999s)]
*  that has backlash when Michelle Obama as First Lady just tried to encourage students to exercise [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=1023.28s)]
*  more and to eat better. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=1031.2s)]
*  And conservatives went berserk saying, who was Michelle Obama to tell us how to live [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=1034.6399999999999s)]
*  our lives and what to eat and what to exercise? [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=1038.6s)]
*  And that wasn't even coercive. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=1041.0s)]
*  That was just encouragement. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=1042.0s)]
*  There was another time Michael Bloomberg as mayor of New York City just tried to put limits [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=1043.0s)]
*  on the size of sodas because fast food restaurants are selling these gigantic mega sodas and [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=1049.0s)]
*  there's few things worse for you and that also trigger addiction to it than sodas. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=1056.0s)]
*  And conservatives said this was the nanny state, this is paternalism. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=1063.0s)]
*  Sean Hannity went on multiple rants against Michelle Obama and against Michael Bloomberg [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=1068.8s)]

*  It's far worse. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=1074.04s)]
*  It's making the criminal law punish the consumption of lab-grown meat for people who actually [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6EJvyTKK4&t=1075.52s)]
