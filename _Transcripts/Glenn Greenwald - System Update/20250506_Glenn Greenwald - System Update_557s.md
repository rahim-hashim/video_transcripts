# Key MAGA Leaders SHUT DOWN Israel-First Law
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [May 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY)
*  That's such an interesting point you were talking before about how you didn't share [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=0.0s)]
*  the same necessarily optimism about this potential within manga. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=9.76s)]
*  I certainly didn't think like, oh, well, look, they're all saying entire-territory [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=14.68s)]
*  criticism. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=18.0s)]
*  There's going to be no war under Trump. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=19.0s)]
*  I knew it was going to be a mutt. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=20.0s)]
*  Just aside from the fact that the Israel lobby is still very powerful. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=21.64s)]
*  A lot of these people have been fed on traditional Republican politics for a long time about [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=24.94s)]
*  words in the Middle East. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=28.2s)]
*  I do think you're right that this idea of how quickly the Israelis are pressuring the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=29.68s)]
*  United States to go to war with Iran, I think has galvanized a lot of the willingness to [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  kind of speak up here. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=41.72s)]
*  We're to the point where Marjorie Taylor Greene was talking about the prospect of war with [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=42.72s)]
*  Iran and has Charlie Kirk. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=47.16s)]
*  But Marjorie Taylor Greene said when talking about this, she said, I'm really sick and [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=49.16s)]
*  tired of having the United States have to go and fight wars for other countries in the [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=52.84s)]
*  Middle East that have large nuclear arsenals and a sophisticated army. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=57.16s)]
*  And it's like, gee, Marjorie, who might you be talking about when you say we have to fight [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=60.519999999999996s)]
*  other wars for a country with a large nuclear arsenal in the Middle East? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=64.6s)]
*  These kind of thoughts have been pretty taboo, especially in right-wing politics, mainstream [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=68.2s)]
*  right-wing politics for a long time. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=73.24s)]
*  And you're seeing it now. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=75.24s)]
*  On the other hand, let me just give you a counterexample. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=76.24s)]
*  You have Governor Greg Abbott, who is the Republican two-term governor of Texas. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=79.32s)]
*  He was one of the people who championed that bill I mentioned before that requires you [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=85.8s)]
*  to pledge that you're not going to boycott Israel. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=89.32s)]
*  He actually issued an executive order, I think, in the early to mid-2024 in response to these [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=92.6s)]
*  protests proclaiming that he was banning anti-Semitism in Texas, which is so funny because the right [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=98.28s)]
*  has been mocking liberal politicians for thinking they can purge the society of racism through [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=104.92s)]
*  government acts. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=109.16s)]
*  But it was basically the same thing. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=110.16s)]
*  There was this interesting event where this small city of San Marcos in Texas had done [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=112.64s)]
*  some sort of analysis where they were able to calculate, I think based on how much the [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=121.2s)]
*  state spends in their per capita of what they pay in taxes, that $4 million of their tax [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=125.0s)]
*  money, this little small city with a lot of problems, is being sent to Israel. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=130.68s)]
*  And so they introduced a resolution saying we're not going to allow those $4 million [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=134.64s)]
*  to be shipped overseas to some foreign country. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=139.6s)]
*  This is for our people and our residents and our well-being and the well-being of our community. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=141.72s)]
*  And you know, representing this sort of like what I think is this growing resentment at [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=148.76s)]
*  how much this is being shoved down people's throat. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=152.0s)]
*  And Greg Abbott that day was enraged and he issued a statement titled which was anti-Israel [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=154.72s)]
*  policies are anti-Texas policies, which I'd love to hear someday someone explain why are [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=162.0s)]
*  anti-Israel, like why if you say you're against the Israeli war in Gaza is that anti-Texas? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=168.44s)]
*  But the letter was filled with threats like how dare you, you know, try and stop your [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=174.08s)]
*  tax money from going to Israel. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=178.36s)]
*  And you can debate like the particulars of whether a city has the right to try and reorganize [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=180.64000000000001s)]
*  this money, whatever. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=184.88s)]
*  I mean there's like little technicalities there. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=185.88s)]
*  But the spirit of this, like to be in the middle of taxes and be like why is our tax [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=187.4s)]
*  like I always felt like this MAGA rhetoric was eventually on a collision course with [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=190.84s)]
*  financing Israel, with doing everything we can for Israel. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=197.36s)]
*  You know I'd have a lot of MAGA people on my show during the Ukraine war and they would [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=200.12s)]
*  say they were against it. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=202.6s)]
*  And I would say why? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=203.6s)]
*  I was luring them to it and they would say oh we have to stop financing other countries' [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=204.6s)]
*  wars. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=208.52s)]
*  They can take care of themselves. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=209.52s)]
*  We have to take care of money. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=210.52s)]
*  You know use this money to take care of everything in our community, including Marjorie Taylor [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=211.52s)]
*  Greene and R.K. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=214.72s)]
*  Jr. and many others. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=215.72s)]
*  And I would say wow that's really interesting because that same rationale applied to Israel [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=216.72s)]
*  and are sending all the money there. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=221.44s)]
*  And they would like stutter around knowing that they couldn't answer it but also not [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=222.44s)]
*  yet ready politically to say yeah Israel is included in that. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=226.36s)]
*  And now you see that. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=230.24s)]
*  So I wonder from your perspective like have all these measures including the ones that [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=231.24s)]
*  you so expertly analyzed and warned about today. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=236.16000000000003s)]
*  It's like just tsunami of them including what I just read from Greg Abbott. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=239.64000000000001s)]
*  Do you think that they realize there is a danger that they're kind of forcing people [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=244.04000000000002s)]
*  to start asking these questions that they previously kind of hid from them? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=249.12s)]
*  Why is it that our politicians are constantly demanding we do things from Israel and why [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=253.04s)]
*  are they silencing us and censoring us and sending our money over there? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=257.2s)]
*  Why is it so focused and obsessive on Israel? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=261.96s)]
*  Do you think that is changing the political climate some? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=265.12s)]
*  That text story that I hadn't heard that before and that is weird. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=271.24s)]
*  Yeah that's something else. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=277.56s)]
*  I know. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=281.48s)]
*  Well look, look, as someone who is a proudly works for reason magazine I will say censorship [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=282.48s)]
*  does not work. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=288.88s)]
*  I think that's an important bottom line that when you try to shut up healthy discussion [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=289.88s)]
*  about a topic that it ensures there's going to be a lot of resentment and unhealthy things [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=294.72s)]
*  coming out. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=299.44s)]
*  I think we are for sure seeing that. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=300.44s)]
*  I think politicians reactions are very typical of politicians in these kinds of repressive [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=303.24s)]
*  contexts on any issue where you see that the kids don't agree with you and then you [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=310.16s)]
*  sort of try something very ham handed to get them to shut up and then you wonder oh why [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=319.16s)]
*  don't they like this. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=324.24s)]
*  I think this is very common around the world when power is threatened to sort of reach [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=325.24s)]
*  for repressive measures and then be kind of confused when people get resentful of that. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=331.52000000000004s)]
*  I do think that there is a sort of older and perhaps unsustainable sort of cultural reverence [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=338.68s)]
*  for Israel that is kind of unique out of all foreign policy issues. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=346.68s)]
*  I mean we could talk about that for a long time and I think again like I think for the [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=349.84s)]
*  older generation this does not come off as weird. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=356.32s)]
*  I think it comes off as like something very natural and something very near and dear to [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=359.15999999999997s)]
*  their identity. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=363.8s)]
*  I will add that it's you know I just want to be clear like this is not Jewish Americans [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=365.28s)]
*  who are necessarily like this. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=369.88s)]
*  Joe Biden was like this. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=371.11999999999995s)]
*  Greg Abbott who is Christian, very Christian is like this. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=372.91999999999996s)]
*  There is a big evangelical component to it for sure and a big kind of national security component. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=375.67999999999995s)]
*  I think there is also a sort of like post World War II liberalism that does see Israel [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=385.79999999999995s)]
*  as sort of like the response to Nazism. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=391.88s)]
*  Israel is the anti-Nazism so if you are anti-Israel that means you are anti-anti-Nazi. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=394.23999999999995s)]
*  Which of course you know it's very different in the Middle East and there is a whole other [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=400.03999999999996s)]
*  context but the war on terror just sort of reinforced that when you had people talking [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=403.56s)]
*  about like Islam or fascism. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=407.59999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, this attempt to always say oh look your enemies are our enemies so you should go to [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=410.03999999999996s)]
*  war to stop our enemies because they are also your enemies. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=415.55999999999995s)]
*  You see that now and then you are always saying oh you know what they chant in Iran, death [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=418.32s)]
*  to America, death to Israel, you are the great Satan. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=421.44s)]
*  So this attempt to kind of conflate all of this has been successful for a long time. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=424.96s)]
*  I just really question whether it's continuing to be and one of the worst things if you depend [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=429.48s)]
*  on a certain belief being pervasive in the culture it's very scary if you say Israel [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=436.04s)]
*  to watch you know basically just older people who are going to be dying off in the next [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=442.4s)]
*  like few years, couple decades, whatever and everyone who is replacing them is feeding [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=447.0s)]
*  on this steady diet of increasingly going in the opposite direction. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=452.56s)]
*  I think that's part of why you are seeing almost like a desperate attempt to just impose [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=457.16s)]
*  these previously unthinkable measures that are designed to control the public debate [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=461.32s)]
*  in a way that they made it almost overt which I also agree, you know we just saw the liberals [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=465.6s)]
*  have that problem like that whole censorship scheme on almost every issue caused the public [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=470.56s)]
*  to resent it and go in the other direction and I really do think you are seeing that [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=475.35999999999996s)]
*  with Israel now. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=479.84s)]
*  Alright well Matthew it was great to have you on I really encourage everybody to read [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=481.47999999999996s)]
*  your article because there are some like the Anti-Semitism Awareness Act is a pretty straightforward [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=484.91999999999996s)]
*  thing you can just understand it quickly and why it's so menacing. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=488.55999999999995s)]
*  This one is a little more complicated to understand especially with the background but I actually [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVmGkDBffY&t=491.71999999999997s)]
