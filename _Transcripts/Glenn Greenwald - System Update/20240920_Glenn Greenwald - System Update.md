# Dems Have "No Hope" of Winning Election Warns Green Party VP Candidate Butch Ware
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [September 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY)
*  Dr. Ware, it's great to see you. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you so much for taking the time to come on our program and talk with us. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=7.76s)]
*  We're glad to have you. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  Great to be with you, Glenn. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=15.16s)]
*  So, you have certainly had over the past several months a significant increase in visibility, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=16.16s)]
*  definitely doing a lot of the rounds in media, making people very aware. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=21.96s)]
*  You've created a lot of positive impact on social media. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  So, I think people have a good understanding of sort of the summary background of who you [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=28.64s)]
*  are and where you've studied and what you've done. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=34.54s)]
*  But politically and ideologically speaking, could you talk about your trajectory from [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=37.760000000000005s)]
*  when you got into politics and what led you to the Green Party and how to become a candidate [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=42.36s)]
*  on its national ticket? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=47.32s)]
*  Yeah, not sure I am in politics. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=49.6s)]
*  I would definitely qualify myself as a public servant before I would qualify myself as a [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=52.96s)]
*  politician. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=57.4s)]
*  And I think when reclassified as a public servant, then it's really been 20 plus years [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=59.519999999999996s)]
*  doing similar work, activist work, academic work, organizing work, bringing communities [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=66.8s)]
*  together, trying to leverage, you know, kind of public visibility as well as kind of community [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=73.24s)]
*  backing to bring about social change. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=79.88s)]
*  And I think that that was probably what drew me or what put me on the radar with the campaign. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=84.0s)]
*  I did an Instagram Live with Dr. Jill Stein just to learn more about her candidacy, to [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=90.67999999999999s)]
*  learn more about the Green Party platform. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=97.44s)]
*  And after I did that, literally within 24 hours, the Green Party reached out to me about [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=100.83999999999999s)]
*  the possibility of running as the VP candidate. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=105.16s)]
*  So I went through a lengthy vetting process, made a lot of phone calls, reached out to [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=108.52s)]
*  mentors, people in the Palestinian community, in the Black community, the Muslim community [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=113.32s)]
*  more broadly. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=118.39999999999999s)]
*  And I also realized that I actually have very deep roots with the Green Party that I hadn't [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=119.96s)]
*  thought about, you know, sort of actualizing. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=125.88s)]
*  My closest friend growing up, Sean Young, was actually the son of the longest serving [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=128.2s)]
*  and first ever elected Green Party official in the state of Minnesota on the south side [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=133.92s)]
*  of Minneapolis. Annie Young, who was like a backup mother to my single mom, you know, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=137.68s)]
*  basically is the one that taught me everything I know about public service and, you know, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=143.52s)]
*  kind of being engaged in political life in public. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=147.16s)]
*  So in a lot of ways, it made a ton of sense. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=150.44s)]
*  And then when I found out that actually Dr. Jill Stein had been mentored by Annie Young [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=152.44s)]
*  in her early days in the Green Party, I realized that while some people might not have seen [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=157.04s)]
*  this coming, that this particular move makes a lot of sense at a lot of levels. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=161.96s)]
*  There's of course a long history that I think is deliberately whitewashed. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=166.92000000000002s)]
*  I mean, people think this never happened of third party candidates, of independent candidates [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=171.12s)]
*  having a very major role in our politics going back to the prior century or the century before. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=175.24s)]
*  During the Woodrow Wilson administration, Eugene Debs, a socialist candidate, was such [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=180.96s)]
*  a threat that they had to imprison him. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=186.04s)]
*  Obviously, you go through the 60s and 70s and you're talking about things like the Black [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=187.88s)]
*  Power movement and radicals like Malcolm X and Marcus Garvey and the socialists that [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=192.6s)]
*  the Weather Underground that grew up around the Vietnam War. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=197.67999999999998s)]
*  I think in the last several decades, though, they've really kind of clamped down on this [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=200.44s)]
*  notion that no, there's just a two party system. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=203.51999999999998s)]
*  Unless you're a billionaire, you can't really have any meaningful impact as a someone outside [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=205.95999999999998s)]
*  of the two party system. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=212.56s)]
*  And a lot of people I know who now support the Green Party who want an alternative to [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=213.56s)]
*  both parties were people who originally when they got into politics had critiques of the [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=218.0s)]
*  Democratic Party. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=222.23999999999998s)]
*  But at the end of the day, they felt like voting for them was the best way to advance [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=223.23999999999998s)]
*  their values. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=226.8s)]
*  However, unsatisfactory it was. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=227.8s)]
*  And I'm wondering if that's the case for you. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=232.08s)]
*  Was there a time ever in your kind of political consciousness how you saw the political world [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=234.12s)]
*  and social activism or you felt like the Democratic Party was a viable vehicle for you to do work [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=240.48000000000002s)]
*  in? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=244.8s)]
*  Never. Not for a single day in my entire life. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=246.36s)]
*  The reason is that Malcolm X, Alhaj Malik Shabazz was sort of a mentor at the time. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=249.36s)]
*  At distance, you know, temporally and spatially, you know, I was born in 1973. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=256.96000000000004s)]
*  Malcolm passed away before I came along. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=260.68s)]
*  But the autobiography of Malcolm X led to my conversion to Islam was the beginning of [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=262.92s)]
*  political consciousness for me at age 15. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=267.2s)]
*  And Malcolm warned about the liberal. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=269.72s)]
*  He described the liberal as a fox. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=274.32s)]
*  It bears its teeth and you think that it is smiling at you, but you are on the menu. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=276.88s)]
*  Whereas the conservative is a wolf. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=282.24s)]
*  It bears its teeth and you know that it's there to eat. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=284.76000000000005s)]
*  So I've never in my entire adult life trusted either liberals or conservatives and the two [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=287.28000000000003s)]
*  party system that we well, we don't have a two party system, but the two parties that have [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=295.56s)]
*  come to dominate the American political system are dominated by liberals and conservatives. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=299.40000000000003s)]
*  So I've never thrown my lot in with the Democratic Party at any level. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=303.96000000000004s)]
*  I voted for the Democrats in my first election that I ever voted. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=308.6s)]
*  Bill Clinton, I voted for Clinton in the first time around, was 18 years old, and I voted for [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=313.76s)]
*  Obama in 2008. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=318.4s)]
*  And I think that those are the only two times that I've actually voted in a presidential [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=321.56s)]
*  election. I'd have to go back and check on that. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=325.08s)]
*  I think I voted in primaries at other points in time. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=327.88s)]
*  My mom was somewhat engaged in Democratic Party politics in the city of Minneapolis, but [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=330.64s)]
*  because of Annie, we mostly stayed around green and third party movements. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=335.08s)]
*  To return to your broader question. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=341.36s)]
*  Yeah, so that Bill Clinton election was the beginning of the end of viable options for [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=346.24s)]
*  third parties for a generation. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=355.04s)]
*  And the reason is Clinton sold out on campaign finance reform. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=356.92s)]
*  My own understanding was that at that point in time, you know, the Democratic Party was [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=361.04s)]
*  interested in campaign finance reform because all the corporate money was behind the [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=366.92s)]
*  Republican Party. And this was something people now forget that Bill Clinton ran on. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=370.16s)]
*  And I was actually very much motivated by this because I thought that the influence of [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=374.08000000000004s)]
*  money in politics was going to make it impossible for people like Annie Young and others to [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=377.84000000000003s)]
*  do well and be successful. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=382.08000000000004s)]
*  And what the Democrats found out is that if they went corporate, too, they could raise as [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=383.96000000000004s)]
*  much money or more than the Republicans could raise. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=390.88s)]
*  And we saw essentially for the past 30 plus years, the Clinton political machine dominate [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=396.36s)]
*  the Democratic Party and go further and further towards corporate selling out to the point [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=402.0s)]
*  that they are now fundamentally indistinguishable. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=407.64s)]
*  There is an ideological difference between quote unquote liberals and quote unquote [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=410.72s)]
*  conservatives. But there is no functional difference between Team Blue and Team Red when [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=416.96s)]
*  it comes to their beholdenness to APAC, to the war machine, to the one percent, to [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=421.96s)]
*  corporate dollars. And I made a social media post before I ever joined the campaign that I said, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=429.32s)]
*  whether you vote Team Blue or Team Red, militarized fascism wins, because what we're [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=434.24s)]
*  essentially seeing in the struggle between Democrats and Republicans is a struggle for [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=438.79999999999995s)]
*  factional control over the corporate machine of the one percent. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=443.32s)]
*  Their patronage networks overlap fundamentally with APAC and the war machine. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=449.84s)]
*  And they're just kind of a fight at the margin between certain kinds of identity groups on [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=455.92s)]
*  one side and Christian nationalists on the other. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=461.44s)]
*  But ultimately, they say they serve the same corporate masters. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=463.71999999999997s)]
*  And you are now seeing this with Team Blue as they recruit people that were well to the [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=467.64s)]
*  right of Ronald Reagan. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=472.16s)]
*  And without blinking an eye, you know, the Democratic Party embraces war criminals like [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=474.40000000000003s)]
*  Dick Cheney because fundamentally Team Blue and Team Red are the same team. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=479.64000000000004s)]
*  I call them purple fascists. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=483.48s)]
*  Yeah, it was really interesting when Liz Cheney talked about not only her endorsement of [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=485.12s)]
*  Kamala, but also her father's. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=488.64000000000004s)]
*  She made very clear it's not just because of animosity toward Trump or his comportment or [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=490.56s)]
*  his. She said very clearly that I'm more comfortable with the foreign party, the foreign [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=494.6s)]
*  policy ideology of the Democratic Party and Kamala Harris and Joe Biden than I am a [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=500.2s)]
*  Trump-led Republican Party. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=506.32s)]
*  And no one was even confused by that. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=508.08s)]
*  For me, that made complete sense. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=510.03999999999996s)]
*  If I were Dick Cheney and my views had been what they had been his whole life, I'd feel [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=511.68s)]
*  very comfortable in the Democratic Party as it's currently constituted as well. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=516.04s)]
*  Let me ask you, I just kind of personal note, it kind of attracted my attention that you [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=520.36s)]
*  said, look, I'm not a politician. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=524.24s)]
*  Don't call me that. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=525.84s)]
*  You know, but the reality is if you're running for any office where you're trying to get [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=527.0s)]
*  votes for yourself, by definition, you sort of are, even if you don't think of yourself [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=532.16s)]
*  primarily as that, which I understand. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=535.68s)]
*  I'm wondering, though, in the past, the Democrats attacked the Greens only when they lost and [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=538.1999999999999s)]
*  needed somebody to blame for their own failures. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=546.1999999999999s)]
*  They couldn't, of course, keep their own stability. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=548.1999999999999s)]
*  So it would be, after the election's over, we're going to heap all this scorn on Ralph [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=549.7199999999999s)]
*  Nader and then in 2000 and then Jill Stein in 2016 and blame them. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=552.64s)]
*  This time, I think it's the first time we're seeing this, there's a great deal of venom [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=556.5600000000001s)]
*  and attacks in a very coordinated way coming from some of the most prominent surrogates [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=561.36s)]
*  of the Democratic Party, AOC, Keith Ellison, coordinated DNC attacks, not just on both [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=567.12s)]
*  of you but sort of on your person and your integrity. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=573.68s)]
*  I mean, AOC called your party Predators. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=575.92s)]
*  I'm wondering if... [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=579.12s)]
*  It's more, yeah. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=580.12s)]
*  Yeah, Predatory, exactly. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=581.12s)]
*  I'm wondering if... [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=582.12s)]
*  I guess Predators is the noun for being Predatory, but I'm wondering... [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=583.12s)]
*  I assume you knew you were going to open yourself up to attacks, but I'm wondering whether you [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=588.76s)]
*  understood or expected that it was going to be at the level of vitriol and kind of personal [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=593.36s)]
*  destruction that you're now seeing it. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=597.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=600.72s)]
*  I mean, to be perfectly honest, those really pathetic and meek attacks made me know never [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=601.72s)]
*  mind. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=611.56s)]
*  I was not in the least bit moved by AOC, Pelosi or Kunti Keith Ellison and their unfortunate [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=612.56s)]
*  attempts because the Democratic Party and, you know, George Takei for that matter, so [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=619.1199999999999s)]
*  they round up people of color and use them as their attack dogs because the Democrat [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=624.0799999999999s)]
*  Party is a plantation. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=628.1999999999999s)]
*  Masses say jump and they say how high and they have to. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=630.7199999999999s)]
*  What's ironic about the attack from Keith Ellison is I had literally seen Keith Ellison [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=634.3599999999999s)]
*  at Friday prayers on the north side of Minneapolis in a neighborhood mosque that we've both gone [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=639.08s)]
*  to for years and he's known me for years. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=642.48s)]
*  And like he shook my hand. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=644.96s)]
*  I gave the Friday sermon that day and he came up to me and talked about how moved he was [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=646.24s)]
*  by my words. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=651.0s)]
*  And I said, can we get a picture together, brother? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=652.32s)]
*  And he said, absolutely. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=654.4s)]
*  I said, this picture is not going to get you in trouble. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=655.4s)]
*  And he said, no. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=657.12s)]
*  And he said, we agreed that we would talk about things, black man to black man, Muslim [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=658.72s)]
*  to Muslim. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=661.96s)]
*  And then as soon as the Democrats call him out for a hit job, he has to go and do what [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=663.08s)]
*  he did. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=668.64s)]
*  And so I'm not the least bit surprised. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=669.64s)]
*  It's unfortunate. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=672.0400000000001s)]
*  But to be perfectly honest, I mean, my mentors and heroes in kind of black resistance movements, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=673.2800000000001s)]
*  people like Malcolm, people like Fred Hampton, people like Kwame Turek, people like Huey [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=680.0400000000001s)]
*  P. Newton, these are people that were running for their lives or standing and fighting for [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=684.96s)]
*  their lives. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=689.1600000000001s)]
*  So these little sorry attacks from the Democrats, that doesn't do anything to me. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=690.16s)]
*  And let me just say one other thing about these really unfortunate and ill fated because [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=695.9599999999999s)]
*  they have not been effective. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=702.4s)]
*  They've actually, quite the contrary, they've served to amplify our message as Greens. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=705.0799999999999s)]
*  The only reason why they are making these attacks beforehand rather than clean up on [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=712.68s)]
*  Isle Blue after the fact is because Democratic polling has to be showing what I've known [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=718.0s)]
*  since I joined the campaign and started to do a careful study, which is that the Democrats [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=724.64s)]
*  cannot win in any of the swing states that they need in order to win the election. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=729.0s)]
*  The Muslim vote in 2020 in the swing states of Georgia, Pennsylvania and Michigan was [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=734.3199999999999s)]
*  65 percent of the vote that dropped to 12 percent with Biden. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=741.7199999999999s)]
*  And there's polling that is about to come out from a major Muslim institution that shows [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=746.24s)]
*  that right now in the Muslim community nationwide, over 50 percent of the vote is going towards [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=752.2s)]
*  third party with us taking the lion's share of that percentage. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=756.4000000000001s)]
*  And then about 15 percent of the Muslim vote is going to Harris and four percent to Trump. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=760.6s)]
*  The Democrats are dead. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=765.0s)]
*  And I know it, they know it, the American people don't know it because CNN and MSNBC [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=766.9200000000001s)]
*  run cover for them, but they have absolutely no hope of winning this November election. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=772.48s)]
*  And so personally, I've turned my attention to trying to draw those Bernie Trump voters [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=777.72s)]
*  and to make a cogent argument to people that haven't registered at all, because I think [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=784.16s)]
*  that the Democratic Party is about to go the way of the Whigs. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=790.2s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's very obvious they would never be giving you airtime and oxygen attention [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=792.88s)]
*  if you weren't actually a threat to them. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=797.36s)]
*  That's exactly what I said when I saw Keith Ellison following OC, is their internal polling [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=799.88s)]
*  on this must be extremely disturbing to them. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=803.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=806.4s)]
*  Let me ask you about a couple of critiques of the Green Party that come not only in bad [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=807.4s)]
*  faith from Democratic hacks like the two we've been talking about, but most recently as well [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=813.56s)]
*  from Ralph Nader, who gave an interview in Mother Jones where he said, I don't have any [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=818.5999999999999s)]
*  regrets about running in 2000. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=822.68s)]
*  I want to see a vibrant third party in the United States. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=824.0s)]
*  That's one of the most important things. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=828.6s)]
*  The one concern I have about the Green Party is that there's not a lot of work, a sufficient [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=829.88s)]
*  amount of work being done between the four years when you get a lot of attention because [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=834.36s)]
*  of the presidential election. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=838.32s)]
*  And I've had Dr. Stein on my show many times before I've asked her about this. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=839.32s)]
*  I know what the argument is. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=842.5600000000001s)]
*  No, we have this, we have that, we have this, we have that. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=843.5600000000001s)]
*  But when it comes from Ralph Nader, I think it's a pretty serious critique that has to [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=846.2s)]
*  be analyzed and not defensively rejected. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=849.44s)]
*  Do you agree with the critique that I know it's not that there's nothing that you just [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=852.32s)]
*  Pop your head up every four years and then disappear. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=856.3199999999999s)]
*  But can the Green Party and should the Green Party be doing a lot more to kind of build [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=858.48s)]
*  a more sustainable, a larger grassroots movement? [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=862.6s)]
*  I would not have joined this campaign if I did not think that we could and should grow [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=867.8399999999999s)]
*  the party between four year presidential cycles. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=875.76s)]
*  And I've made the commitment personally, internally, you can now break the story, Glenn, you're [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=879.36s)]
*  going to be the first one to have this, that I have been doing research with my team and [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=883.76s)]
*  I fully intend to run for governor of the state of California in 2026. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=890.12s)]
*  And I am putting together a slate personally, like of people that I have worked with over [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=895.3199999999999s)]
*  the past two decades. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=901.4399999999999s)]
*  And in consultation with Jill, in consultation with our campaign manager, Jason Call, of [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=903.76s)]
*  putting together a roster of people to run for congressional seats, quite possibly one [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=909.92s)]
*  to run for a Senate seat. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=914.68s)]
*  So I absolutely agree with the. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=916.64s)]
*  So we know that there's a bad faith version of this argument, right? [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=921.32s)]
*  But there is a good version of this argument. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=923.8s)]
*  Now, the good faith version of the argument perhaps understates the importance of that [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=927.28s)]
*  four year electoral run, which is that without that presidential candidate at the top of [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=932.76s)]
*  the ticket, ballot access is compromised in subsequent years. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=938.36s)]
*  And the ability of the Green Party to stay on nationwide ballots is extraordinary amongst [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=944.7600000000001s)]
*  what Dr. Jill refers to as people powered parties, right? [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=952.32s)]
*  Usually people powered parties show up for one or perhaps two electoral cycles and simply [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=956.24s)]
*  cannot maintain. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=961.0s)]
*  And the reason why I considered this offer seriously and eventually accepted it is that [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=963.0400000000001s)]
*  the Green Party, going back to its roots at McAllister in 1984, has demonstrated not [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=968.24s)]
*  only the staying power, but the capacity to extend its electoral reach. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=973.28s)]
*  We are on enough ballots to win the election. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=977.44s)]
*  And I would not have joined any campaign that did not have the capacity to win this election, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=980.2s)]
*  even if it is a Muhammad Ali, Sonny Liston, one in a thousand type shot. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=986.6s)]
*  As a Black Muslim, I'm happy with taking Ali odds. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=991.44s)]
*  And I think that even if we don't land that knockout punch this time around, that the [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=995.68s)]
*  visibility of this national campaign combined with a consistent approach to running for [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1000.2399999999999s)]
*  congressional and Senate and mayoral and gubernatorial, that by filling out a robust roster and slate [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1006.56s)]
*  of candidates, that we are going to be very, very well poised in 2028. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1014.92s)]
*  I want to ask you about, I would never ask a candidate to affirm the idea that there's [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1020.88s)]
*  no way to win. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1026.72s)]
*  That would be ridiculous. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1027.72s)]
*  Nor should you affirm that. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1028.72s)]
*  As you say, you're on the ballot in all 50 states. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1030.64s)]
*  The strange things happen. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1032.8s)]
*  But 47, 47 technically. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1035.4s)]
*  Because Democrats have gotten you removed. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1038.2s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1040.24s)]
*  They managed to get us removed. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1041.24s)]
*  There are three states. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1043.6s)]
*  It's only, I think, like 15 or 19 electoral college votes that we're ineligible for. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1044.6s)]
*  But yeah, other than that, we're doing pretty damn good. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1049.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1051.04s)]
*  Because the party that loves democracy has made such a concerted effort to get you off [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1052.04s)]
*  the ballot in as many states as they can. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1054.48s)]
*  But what I'm really interested in is like, when you spend a lot of time talking to grassroots [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1056.52s)]
*  voters and we have all these elites who are anointed in the media and NGOs who purport [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1062.64s)]
*  to speak on the behalf of people in various groups with whom they actually have nothing [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1068.0800000000002s)]
*  in common or very little in common, there's a huge gap between elite discourse for many [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1072.9s)]
*  groups and what the people in those groups are actually thinking. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1078.36s)]
*  We see there's so much evidence for that. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1080.76s)]
*  When you go and you speak to Muslim and Arab voters particularly in places like Michigan [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1083.12s)]
*  or Pennsylvania and other states where their votes can matter, I'm curious what kind of [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1089.2s)]
*  pitch to them that, especially if they're not convinced that you're going to win but [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1095.8799999999999s)]
*  nonetheless want to support you, what do you think is their driving motive for that? [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1101.12s)]
*  Is it that they just want to kind of hurt Democrats out of anger? [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1107.0s)]
*  Is it that they want to make clear what their protest is with the hope that the Democrats [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1110.16s)]
*  will know that they can't continue to get their votes for nothing? [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1114.0s)]
*  What is it that they're thinking rationally about why they want to do that? [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1117.32s)]
*  Excellent question. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1122.76s)]
*  So I'll tell you what it's not. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1123.76s)]
*  It is not a protest vote that is designed to make the Democrats do anything. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1125.3600000000001s)]
*  The Democrat party has lost Muslim voters and it will not get them back. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1132.16s)]
*  Participation in a genocide where you have offed one-tenth of the population of the third [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1137.3600000000001s)]
*  holiest place in Islam, that loses you the Muslims forever. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1145.5600000000002s)]
*  So the Democrats are never getting the Muslim vote back and the Muslim vote is growing. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1152.4s)]
*  And then just with respect to interaction with communities, let's just be clear. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1156.96s)]
*  So first and foremost, the Black Muslim community, the African American Muslim community is still [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1162.04s)]
*  the largest single ethnic contingent inside the Muslim community in America. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1166.8799999999999s)]
*  So that means that when I'm having face-to-face conversation with folks about this, it also [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1172.28s)]
*  means that there's this massive section of the Black community that is in no way listening [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1176.6s)]
*  at all to anything the Democrats have to say. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1181.8799999999999s)]
*  They have simply checked out of the Democrat party altogether and have no interest in ever [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1186.04s)]
*  voting for them again. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1191.24s)]
*  So when you talk about Muslims now specifically, and I'm somebody that has served not just [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1192.84s)]
*  in a kind of academic position, but I give Friday sermons routinely at different places [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1197.56s)]
*  around the country. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1202.2s)]
*  I've never kind of tried to depict myself as a spiritual leader, but I am rooted in [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1203.72s)]
*  the Islamic tradition in ways that are similar to the way somebody like Raphael Warnock would [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1210.36s)]
*  be rooted in the Black Christian tradition. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1216.52s)]
*  So when I make this argument in the Muslim community, Black, Arab, South Asian, white [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1220.14s)]
*  convert, all of them, there's a very clear argument that comes back, which is that nobody [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1226.42s)]
*  wants to have their vote recorded in the eternal tablets as having co-signed for genocide. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1232.74s)]
*  And quite the opposite, people want to have an opportunity to register their dissent from [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1242.42s)]
*  this moral abomination. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1249.34s)]
*  They want to write this in the registries of cosmic scales, or for those that are just [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1251.74s)]
*  people of conscience more than they are people of conscience rather than people of faith, [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1258.26s)]
*  they want history to record their dissent from the most heinous genocide that we have [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1264.06s)]
*  witnessed in our lifetimes. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1269.54s)]
*  I think that it's very, very difficult to overstate the extent of the moral repugnance [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1273.46s)]
*  of this genocide for all people with functioning hearts, whether Muslim, Christian, Jewish, [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1282.7800000000002s)]
*  atheist, agnostic, all of the above. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1291.8200000000002s)]
*  If you have anything resembling compassion or mercy for humanity in your heart, you cannot [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1295.5800000000002s)]
*  take seriously voting for the people that are complicit in execution of this genocide. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1301.98s)]
*  I can't tell you... [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1307.7s)]
*  Okay, sorry, go ahead. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1308.7s)]
*  No, go ahead. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1309.7s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1310.7s)]
*  No, go ahead. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1311.7s)]
*  That's it. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1312.7s)]
*  No, I was going to say, there are a few things that have made me more disgusted and enraged [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1313.7s)]
*  than watching a lot of establishment left liberals posture in a very radical pose over [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1316.8600000000001s)]
*  the last 10 months by screaming genocide, this is a genocide, making a lot of benefits [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1324.18s)]
*  for themselves and traffic and profit and better branding, who on a dime, very predictably, [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1329.94s)]
*  turn around now and aren't just saying they're going to vote for part of the government, [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1337.26s)]
*  Kamala Harris and Joe Biden, that have been arming the Israelis, that have been funding [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1341.22s)]
*  the Israelis, that have, as you said, facilitated it, but who also, they're being very enthusiastic [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1343.94s)]
*  about it, like, oh, they're lying to themselves and to others saying, this is going to change. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1350.16s)]
*  How is it that you can, on the one hand, accuse people credibly of facilitating and being [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1353.88s)]
*  a conspirator in genocide, and then turn around and devote all your energy to continuing [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1358.22s)]
*  to empower those very people who did it, unless you have no authenticity in what you said, [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1365.38s)]
*  or you just don't have a soul? [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1370.26s)]
*  I think you said it so well, and it was kind of cathartic for me to hear that. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1373.74s)]
*  Let me ask you a question, a critique of the left that I think is really important. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1377.98s)]
*  As you might know, I've been based in Brazil for a long time, and there was a sort of, [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1382.42s)]
*  Brazil has been dominated by what you could call the left. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1386.5s)]
*  It's really a center-left party, not a left-wing party that would be recognized by real left-wing [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1388.54s)]
*  radicals, but it's certainly more to the left. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1393.9799999999998s)]
*  Lula da Silva was born poor, very poor. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1396.1799999999998s)]
*  He then got his start working in factories where he lost a finger. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1399.78s)]
*  He became a union leader. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1403.4599999999998s)]
*  So it's a very obvious trajectory and kind of origin out of which he's coming, and as [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1404.58s)]
*  a result, even just the way he speaks, it's mocked by the elites. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1410.58s)]
*  He's Portuguese, he makes errors that people in very elite circles, in São Paulo and sort [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1414.94s)]
*  of the city centers mock him for it. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1421.42s)]
*  It just gives him more of a connection to the people because he's so obviously one of them. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1424.22s)]
*  Sounds like my kind of guy. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1427.9s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1429.9s)]
*  I mean, in terms of political talent, there are very few people like him. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1430.9s)]
*  But the problem is that in the Brazilian left, and I think this is true of the left throughout [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1434.94s)]
*  the democratic world, certainly in Western Europe and in the United States, the left [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1439.18s)]
*  has started to become a party of affluent, credentialed elites who are really removed [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1443.38s)]
*  from the ordinary people on whose behalf they're trying to speak. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1451.5s)]
*  Not to, I don't want to make it personal, but you know, Jill Stein, who's heading this [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1454.42s)]
*  ticket is a Harvard-trained internist who practiced medicine at a very high level. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1458.3000000000002s)]
*  You yourself are a PhD in history from one of America's most elite schools. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1463.42s)]
*  I don't think that precludes you from keeping a connection to ordinary people, but I do [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1468.1000000000001s)]
*  think it makes it more of a challenge. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1472.04s)]
*  And I think that's one of the reasons why we're seeing so many people who could easily [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1473.8s)]
*  support a left-wing agenda. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1478.1599999999999s)]
*  You just sort of talked about the Bernie Trump voter migrating instead to right-wing populism [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1479.44s)]
*  that seems to have a much better capacity to speak in a language that they respond to [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1485.48s)]
*  more viscerally that doesn't seem patronizing or artificial. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1490.72s)]
*  First of all, do you agree with that critique of the left in the democratic world, this [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1493.24s)]
*  difficulty? [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1497.52s)]
*  And if you do, what do you think can be done about it? [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1498.52s)]
*  I would not, I would not put the left and the democratic world together in that equation. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1501.32s)]
*  So similar perhaps to the depiction that you would offer, I actually don't really see the [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1507.8s)]
*  Green Party and some people in the Green Party would have a problem with this characterization, [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1512.36s)]
*  but I'm just going to be blunt about it. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1516.28s)]
*  I see it also as a center-left party. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1518.12s)]
*  I see the Democrats and the Republicans as being so far to the extreme right that they [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1521.48s)]
*  are barely visible from the center-left. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1527.3999999999999s)]
*  And what I would say in response to this, like for myself personally, let me just be [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1532.24s)]
*  clear. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1536.24s)]
*  So I'm the son of a locksmith with a sixth grade education. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1537.24s)]
*  My mother was a teenage mother who at the age of 15 was pregnant with me and was told [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1541.36s)]
*  by her high school guidance counselor to abort the child. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1546.6799999999998s)]
*  I never lived at the same street address for a calendar year consecutively until I was [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1550.56s)]
*  nine years old. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1556.44s)]
*  It was living at relatives' houses, one eviction after the next, sometimes living in a vehicle, [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1557.44s)]
*  sometimes living in a battered women's shelter, sometimes living in other kinds of shelters. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1563.6000000000001s)]
*  It was having the heat cut off, the electricity cut off through my childhood, learning to [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1568.0400000000002s)]
*  use the stove at eight years old because my mom was working two jobs to try to keep a [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1572.24s)]
*  roof over our head. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1576.3200000000002s)]
*  And so I was cooking for my brother at age eight. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1577.92s)]
*  So I fundamentally and thoroughly reject the idea that there is anything elite or elitist [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1581.76s)]
*  about my background. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1587.28s)]
*  I was able to get a PhD and have taught at major research universities for the last 20 [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1589.1599999999999s)]
*  years. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1595.0s)]
*  And most of my organizing and activist work has been inside Black and Muslim communities [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1596.0s)]
*  that are oftentimes operating below the poverty level. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1601.6s)]
*  And those are my primary constituencies. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1606.0s)]
*  And those are the people that I ask to hold me accountable. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1608.8400000000001s)]
*  And yes, I can sometimes get academic in my jargon, in my lingo, but I can also always [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1611.8400000000001s)]
*  try to find a way to express things in ways that are going to be relatable to your average [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1618.8400000000001s)]
*  person that is trying to make sure that they get the next meal onto the table. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1624.08s)]
*  So, yes, I agree with your overall depiction in some ways, especially of the Democrats, [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1629.08s)]
*  especially of some doctrinaire leftists. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1636.1999999999998s)]
*  But I don't consider myself any of those things. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1643.1999999999998s)]
*  I consider myself somebody that is raised and steeped in the Black radical resistance [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1647.1599999999999s)]
*  and revolutionary tradition. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1653.76s)]
*  But that I've always been trying to make sure that I could communicate the fruits and benefits [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1656.1599999999999s)]
*  of that tradition in a way that are universally accessible to all. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1662.52s)]
*  Yeah, I've seen this many times, including with my late husband who was a member of Congress [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1666.76s)]
*  but grew up in a favela in Brazil, was an orphan at the age of five, often didn't have [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1669.44s)]
*  food. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1673.24s)]
*  Those kind of experiences mark you forever. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1674.3600000000001s)]
*  They become a part of you even if you want to escape them, which he didn't. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1675.96s)]
*  It doesn't sound like you do. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1678.92s)]
*  They're in your blood. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1679.92s)]
*  They're in your bones. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1680.92s)]
*  And you speak about them not as an abstraction, but as something that you just understand [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1682.42s)]
*  on such a visceral level. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1686.54s)]
*  And I think that's a big part of it. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1687.54s)]
*  You can be well intentioned. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1690.72s)]
*  You can be kind-hearted. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1691.8000000000002s)]
*  You can be empathetic. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1693.26s)]
*  But if these are issues that are kind of an abstraction to you in terms of the way you've [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1694.76s)]
*  lived your life, I think it's very difficult to, unless you're kind of a sociopathic political [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1697.4599999999998s)]
*  talent, to convince people that you understand them. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1703.1s)]
*  When I talk about the impact of the carceral state, I'm talking about my dad being in and [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1707.1399999999999s)]
*  out of jail, in and out of our lives. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1711.4199999999998s)]
*  When I talk about the dependency complex that the Democrats have cultivated, I'm literally [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1713.1399999999999s)]
*  thinking about going and visiting my half-brothers on the most dangerous block in Washington, [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1718.4199999999998s)]
*  the corner of Georgia and Morton, where I got shot at almost every time I visited them. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1723.3000000000002s)]
*  And during the time when my dad, who essentially drank himself to death on the streets of D.C., [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1728.02s)]
*  but in one of the time periods where he was clean, I'm going to visit my half-brothers [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1733.18s)]
*  at that block, which they called Lorton Morton because it was essentially a back and forth [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1736.94s)]
*  between that block at Georgia and Morton and the Lorton Penitentiary. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1741.5s)]
*  He had all of his clothes in trash bags in my stepmother's closet because the welfare [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1746.6999999999998s)]
*  people that provided her benefits would do spot checks to see if there was a male living [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1755.5s)]
*  in the household. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1759.78s)]
*  So at a time when my father was doing everything that he could to get himself clean and straight [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1761.3799999999999s)]
*  and be there for his kids, the dependency complex that the Democrats have cultivated [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1766.62s)]
*  were making it so that it was incentivized that there not be a male in the household. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1772.22s)]
*  So he's literally living with his stuff in trash bags. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1777.0600000000002s)]
*  If you do not know what that experience looks and feels like up close, then miss me with [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1779.3400000000001s)]
*  everything that you have to recommend in the way of policy. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1783.9s)]
*  Totally. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1786.8600000000001s)]
*  And I think honestly, the reason why you've made the impact that I referred to earlier, [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1787.8600000000001s)]
*  and I guess you'll like this since you want to avoid the professional politician label, [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1790.94s)]
*  is because I think the way you're speaking, it's not even the ideology or the fact that [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1795.54s)]
*  you're a Green Party member, I think the way you're speaking is a much rarer and more [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1799.22s)]
*  authentic form of communication that translates so well, it becomes so conspicuous when surrounded [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1804.3000000000002s)]
*  by so many people who just don't have the capacity to do that or their willingness to [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1809.9s)]
*  do it because they just don't have the experience for it. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1813.74s)]
*  Let me ask you this last question. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1815.7s)]
*  One of the, I know there's a wide range of issues that both Dr. Stein and yourself and [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1818.6200000000001s)]
*  the party are emphasizing during this campaign, but clearly one of the things that is front [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1824.46s)]
*  and center is the fact that you're the only ones who remotely want the US to stop arming [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1828.7s)]
*  and funding the Israeli state in general, having American workers pay for the Israeli [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1835.5800000000002s)]
*  military, supporting and placing no limits on what they can do with American weapons, [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1840.42s)]
*  and that's a huge issue for a lot of people. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1845.78s)]
*  What do you, in these conversations you're having, these trips you're having, is that [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1849.38s)]
*  an issue that obviously for Muslim and Arab voters it is, including for Black Muslims, [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1854.02s)]
*  but when you're talking about say African Americans in these swing states and the Midwest, [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1859.98s)]
*  people like that and they're migrating away from the Democratic Party, is this an issue [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1865.78s)]
*  of central importance to them or is it just more kind of symbolizes what the values of [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1868.94s)]
*  this party really are? [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1873.54s)]
*  So I think both. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1876.7s)]
*  So the first thing that I would say is that if you look at the people that have been bearing [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1878.6599999999999s)]
*  the brunt of the repressive attacks on campus, encampments and so forth, these have been [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1884.76s)]
*  people of color broadly and especially African Americans. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1894.02s)]
*  Like Black folks have been at the forefront of a lot of these struggles and while yes, [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1898.2199999999998s)]
*  it's true that there's been a weaponization of Black identity that Kamala has tapped into [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1904.1000000000001s)]
*  and that many of us are struggling against, it's nonetheless the case that Black communities [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1910.66s)]
*  specifically have been at the forefront of the Free Palestine Movement in large part [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1914.7800000000002s)]
*  because people like Malcolm, people like Kwame Ture, people like James Baldwin, people like [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1919.0600000000002s)]
*  Angela Davis, people like Asada Shakur, people like Thomas Kassankara, people like Nelson [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1923.5400000000002s)]
*  Mandela all taught us, the Black radical tradition as a whole taught us, that the Palestinian [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1928.3000000000002s)]
*  freedom struggle was an important part of anti-imperial struggle because this was a [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1933.76s)]
*  struggle against white supremacy. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1938.04s)]
*  And I actually started the hashtag in 2021, Zionism is white supremacy based on the teachings [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1939.56s)]
*  of those scholars. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1944.8799999999999s)]
*  So the first thing that I would say is that yes, this absolutely is an issue in Black [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1946.48s)]
*  communities, though for an older demographic, it is not as acute, right? [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1951.2s)]
*  that there are, you know, kind of entrenched political allegiances on the north side of [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1956.88s)]
*  30 to the Democratic Party in all kinds of communities of color that we have to work [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1962.48s)]
*  against, which brings me to really the fundamental response to your question. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1967.72s)]
*  For the 18 to 30 demographic, the freedom in Palestine and the freedom from fascism [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1972.64s)]
*  not just red fascism, but blue fascism with the establishment of these cop cities, with [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1982.56s)]
*  the attacks on encampments. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1987.56s)]
*  Listen, the 18 to 30 demographic is something, you know, like 70 to 80 percent against the [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1989.04s)]
*  genocide in Gaza. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1995.34s)]
*  This is a group of youth that are mobilized and actualized. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=1997.22s)]
*  And I'm not going to give away any of the kind of campaign secrets that I've literally [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=2001.32s)]
*  brought into the campaign about how to reach that generation. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=2005.8999999999999s)]
*  But let's just say that they did not ban TikTok fast enough, that we have a technical [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=2009.96s)]
*  plan to increase voter registration and turnout in that 18 to 30 demographic by 20 to 30 percent. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=2016.92s)]
*  And if we are able to do that across the board, then we are going to tap into this vast and [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=2027.1200000000001s)]
*  deep well of resistance to imperialism abroad and fascism here at home in this younger generation. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=2032.3600000000001s)]
*  And like Ali did, we might just shock the world. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=2040.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah, it was very apparent to me the first, second, third time that I saw you participating [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=2043.56s)]
*  in these public conversations, that your visibility, your impact, we're only going to grow. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=2049.52s)]
*  And if you continue down the road that you're describing, which I really hope you will, [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=2054.72s)]
*  I think that's just going to continue even more. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=2058.48s)]
*  It's been great to talk to you. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=2061.36s)]
*  I wish I had more time. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=2062.6s)]
*  I actually have a lot of things, other things that I wanted to ask you about, but we'd love [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=2063.6s)]
*  to have you back on. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=2066.12s)]
*  And I hope you continue doing what you're doing. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=2067.6s)]
*  And thanks so much for taking the time to talk to us. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=2069.2s)]
*  Anytime, brother. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=2071.8399999999997s)]
*  Let's make it happen again. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=2072.8399999999997s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_WF0Jt8ahY&t=2073.8399999999997s)]
