# Should Humanity Continue? Glenn Reacts to Thiel Interview
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [July 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU)
*  All right, next question. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=0.0s)]
*  Kay Kotwas, who says this, have you had a chance to watch the Peter Thiel interview [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=7.84s)]
*  with Ross Duthat? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=13.76s)]
*  Feels stutters and hesitates when he's asked, quote, should the human race continues? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=15.76s)]
*  He also thinks our biggest problem is, quote, stagnation and that anyone who's weary or [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=21.56s)]
*  cautious about the risks of AI, biotech, and nuclear war is, quote, the antichrist. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=25.9s)]
*  And he unironically says that Greta Thunberg is more likely to bring about a one world [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=31.46s)]
*  totalitarian state. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=36.18s)]
*  Isn't it deeply concerning that these tech billionaires think of themselves as philosophers, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=38.3s)]
*  especially when their insane pseudo-religious cult holds so much political influence? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=42.54s)]
*  Do we have the clip of this, by the way? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=50.3s)]
*  I don't think we do. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=52.3s)]
*  It's my fault. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=53.3s)]
*  I don't think I asked for it. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=54.3s)]
*  So I wish we had it, but if we don't, it's because of my omission. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=55.42s)]
*  I don't want to be too cavalier about paraphrasing this. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=60.1s)]
*  The question did do a good job of describing it. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=66.7s)]
*  I'd rather show the actual words. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=69.7s)]
*  And maybe we'll be able to pull that up. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=71.26s)]
*  We're going to check for you. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=72.78s)]
*  If you haven't heard it, it's really worth watching it. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=74.06s)]
*  Definitely, I understand why it provoked this question. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=75.9s)]
*  So let me focus on the part that I do actually feel comfortable paraphrasing, which is Ross [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=79.3s)]
*  Dufat did ask Peter Thiel, do you favor the continuation of the human race? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=89.18s)]
*  Is this something that you actually think is a good thing? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=94.82s)]
*  And Elon Musk has been asked this before. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=97.25999999999999s)]
*  Part of what Elon Musk wants to do is make sure humanity is multi-planetary, start with [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=99.58s)]
*  life on Mars. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=104.66s)]
*  A lot of people think, oh, you must think that's because humanity on the Earth is doomed. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=105.66s)]
*  Otherwise, why is it so important to you to make humanity multi-planetary? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=110.14s)]
*  There are other reasons why you might, but that's a suspicion. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=114.62s)]
*  And not just to make it multi-planetary because the Earth is doomed, but also to transform [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=118.1s)]
*  what it means to be human. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=121.86s)]
*  And there's been this kind of philosophy that has been popular among these more extreme [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=125.1s)]
*  non-valley types of transhumanism, something that transcends humanity or fundamentally [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=131.58s)]
*  transforms it. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=138.98000000000002s)]
*  Typically, I think merging humanity with technology or with machine for a superior being, it's [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=139.98000000000002s)]
*  definitely how a lot of them think of artificial intelligence. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=150.62s)]
*  I, one time, got a root canal, which I hate as much as anybody. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=155.14000000000001s)]
*  I think I hate it more, but probably everyone hates it equally. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=159.74s)]
*  But one of the only good things about it is because it lasts off in two hours, I have [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=164.26s)]
*  the time to sit and listen to podcasts that ordinarily I wouldn't have time to listen [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=168.1s)]
*  to or the inclination just because I have to have my brain distracted. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=172.01999999999998s)]
*  I can't, even if my mouth is totally numb and I don't feel it, I don't like hearing [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=174.38s)]
*  what the dentist is doing, I don't want to think about what tools he's using and why. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=178.3s)]
*  There's almost no job I'd rather have least than being a dentist and just constantly being [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=187.38000000000002s)]
*  in someone's mouth every day looking at their teeth. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=190.9s)]
*  But whatever, so I try and distract myself. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=193.3s)]
*  One of the ways I did so in the last few months is I listened to Mark Zuckerberg's appearance [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=196.10000000000002s)]
*  on Joe Rogan and Mark Zuckerberg was talking at length about his vision that soon we're [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=199.34s)]
*  going to take all these devices, virtual reality devices and AI devices, and they're no longer [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=206.46s)]
*  going to be exterior instruments that we wear like goggles on our head or phones or earpieces [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=215.29999999999998s)]
*  or things in our phone. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=222.42s)]
*  It's going to be part of our anatomy. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=223.78s)]
*  He was talking about drilling into brains in order to have this technology part of the [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=225.5s)]
*  human brain and at first he said the first use is going to be medical, somebody has a [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=233.62s)]
*  neurological injury or some other serious neurological problem, this machine will help [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=239.29999999999998s)]
*  them with that functionality. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=246.06s)]
*  But he was talking as well about an ultimate merger between technology and human beings [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=247.98s)]
*  which in one way may not change the nature of human beings in the beginning, it's just [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=252.57999999999998s)]
*  kind of another instrument. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=256.78s)]
*  You can imagine this earpiece, I'm wearing an earpiece because I need to be able to communicate [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=263.09999999999997s)]
*  with people I work with, but say you wear an earpiece of the kind people use commonly [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=267.82s)]
*  now to listen to things on a computer, connect by Bluetooth to their phones, does it really [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=271.86s)]
*  change humanity if instead of just having this come in and out it's just now implanted [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=277.9s)]
*  in our ears? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=283.02s)]
*  Does it really change humanity? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=284.02s)]
*  But when you start talking about the brain and changing how our brains think and produce [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=287.94s)]
*  thought or having AI be the future of what a human being should be but in a spirit form [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=295.14s)]
*  that's clearly transhumanistic, that's transforming what a human being fundamentally is. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=301.46s)]
*  There's all kinds of questions that come with that, if you believe in a soul, does this [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=307.62s)]
*  have a soul? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=311.02s)]
*  And the way Mark Zuckerberg was so cavalier in talking about it I found very creepy. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=313.7s)]
*  And let me show you this clip. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=319.34s)]
*  Now let me just say one thing, I think the question referenced that Peter Thiel stuttered [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=321.06s)]
*  when he answered and kind of had big pauses, Peter Thiel always does that and the reason [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=326.62s)]
*  is because, and he's talked about this before, he's autistic and that means you don't have [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=331.66s)]
*  the same capacity for social interaction. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=337.06s)]
*  Now one of the things Peter Thiel said, and I find a lot of what Peter Thiel says disturbing, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=339.9s)]
*  but one of the things he said that I found super interesting is a few years ago when [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=344.58s)]
*  he was talking about autism and he was saying that in a lot of ways he thinks that being [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=347.9s)]
*  autistic, not severely autistic or you aren't verbal, you can't interact with people at [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=354.46s)]
*  all, you know somewhere on the spectrum of where he places himself, that the benefit [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=360.53999999999996s)]
*  of it is that when you don't have autism and you're very clued into social cues and we [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=366.38s)]
*  are social and political animals, we do interact as groups, we are not solitary beings, that [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=371.72s)]
*  if you're so aware of social cues and you're constantly receiving what social cues are, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=379.92s)]
*  in a way it's making you more conformist, it's kind of morphing you into society, you [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=384.8s)]
*  understand what society expects of you, you understand what society thinks, you understand [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=388.0s)]
*  what you're supposed to say in certain situations, in most situations, and he was saying that [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=392.84000000000003s)]
*  that can really make you conformist, it can kind of just make you part of this blob, whereas [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=398.16s)]
*  he sees his autism as almost a gift because feeling detached or excluded or isolated from [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=402.40000000000003s)]
*  majoritarian societal sentiments and ethos and mores forces you to see things differently, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=411.68s)]
*  to look at things differently, and then that of course is the kind of thing that can lead [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=420.8s)]
*  to innovation, invention, Steve Jobs was not autistic but he actually has said in interviews, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=425.52s)]
*  people don't like to talk about this, but it's so true, that had he not taken LSD and had experience [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=434.79999999999995s)]
*  with other hallucinogens, he never would have invented the iPad or various Apple products, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=441.35999999999996s)]
*  that it was that kind of transcendent thought that enabled him to have this vision that [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=448.71999999999997s)]
*  he otherwise wouldn't have had, and on some level, mind altering drugs can be analogized [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=455.56s)]
*  to autism, and so yes, Peter Thiel stutters, he stumbles, oftentimes it seems like he's [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=461.64s)]
*  sweating or having difficulty answering a question when in reality it's just, it is [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=468.68s)]
*  and the way he speaks, but it does affect how people perceive him, and so let me show you this [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=474.08s)]
*  clip that the question asked, because I think it's really worth hearing him in his own words, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=479.03999999999996s)]
*  let's go ahead and show that. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=483.28s)]
*  Yes, but I also would like us to radically solve these problems, and so it's always, I don't know, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=504.0s)]
*  transhumanism is this, the ideal was this radical transformation where your human natural body gets [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=521.2s)]
*  transformed into an immortal body, and there's a critique of, let's say, the trans people in a [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=530.96s)]
*  sexual context, or I don't know, transvestite is someone who changes their clothes and cross dresses, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=539.12s)]
*  and a transsexual is someone where you change your penis into a vagina, and we can then debate how [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=545.6s)]
*  well those surgeries work, but we want more transformation than that, it's, the critique is [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=552.1600000000001s)]
*  not that it's weird and unnatural, it's, man, it's so pathetically little, and okay, we want more [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=557.6s)]
*  than cross dressing or changing your sex organs, we want you to be able to change your heart and [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=563.12s)]
*  change your mind and change your whole body, and then orthodox Christianity, by the way, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=568.96s)]
*  the critique orthodox Christianity has of this is these things don't go far enough, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=576.16s)]
*  like the transhumanism is just changing your body, but you also need to transform. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=580.96s)]
*  Okay, I, so there it is, and let me say a couple things about this. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=585.12s)]
*  People who think about changes in the future are often looked at as strange and weird, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=594.72s)]
*  because generally the future is something we can't really imagine. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=602.88s)]
*  I used to, I remember when I was young, I'm still young, but I remember when I was younger, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=607.6s)]
*  when I was a child, and I used to go visit my grandparents, and they were born, my grandfather [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=612.8s)]
*  was born in 1904, my grandmother was born in 1910, and I spent a lot of time over there [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=617.5999999999999s)]
*  when I was younger, and I constantly thought about how bizarre it was that they were born into a world [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=624.16s)]
*  that didn't have airplanes, didn't have radio, didn't have television, didn't really have phones, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=633.12s)]
*  and then during their lifetime, like all this technology that previously had been considered [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=640.16s)]
*  unthinkable, like how is something going to fly in the air over, you know, the earth? How are people [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=644.9599999999999s)]
*  going to talk to each other using like weird connective machines, or you know, television [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=651.12s)]
*  that started off black and white and then became color, or film that started off silent and then [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=658.7199999999999s)]
*  became with audio, all these things were unthinkable at the beginning, and I was sitting, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=663.28s)]
*  it must be so strange to be born into a world where this unthinkable technology doesn't exist, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=669.04s)]
*  and then suddenly it arrives, and it just changes your world, and all those technologies obviously [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=673.68s)]
*  had a major effect on the world, and then I had my own experience. I was born in 1967, so [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=678.16s)]
*  it wasn't really until the mid-90s when the internet really started to become [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=685.04s)]
*  something that is recognizable when we compare it to now, and I was, you know, 24, 25 when the [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=688.88s)]
*  internet started really being something that I used in my life, and obviously it's a major [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=694.24s)]
*  transformative innovation, and so if you had thought about the internet before it happened, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=698.16s)]
*  it would seem inconceivable, and so people who describe the future in ways that seem [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=704.08s)]
*  inconceivable always come off as very strange and weird, so I think we ought to acknowledge that. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=707.68s)]
*  But I want to say two things on the other side as kind of big caveats. One is [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=713.2s)]
*  the idea of a billionaire. Until you really interact with billionaires, it's hard to explain [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=720.72s)]
*  what they're like, and I've had pretty close interactions with many of them. Obviously I [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=726.8000000000001s)]
*  founded a media company with one of them, Pierre Midiard, who I think is worth like [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=732.32s)]
*  12 billion dollars or whatever, and a lot of people have been interested in that, and so [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=735.76s)]
*  billion dollars or whatever, and a lot of other people in Silicon Valley whom I've gotten to know [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=741.44s)]
*  some. Being rich obviously doesn't describe that. Like the amount of wealth that you have, like when [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=745.9200000000001s)]
*  you're a billionaire, you don't think of yourself as just rich, you start thinking about, you know, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=753.6s)]
*  what you can do to change the world, change the government, like change countries, change [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=759.6800000000001s)]
*  culture. It's so much power, it's so much money, and with power and money comes in almost every case [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=764.64s)]
*  being surrounded by sycophants, people constantly flattering you, constantly saying yes to everything [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=774.88s)]
*  that you think and say and want, because power means you can do so many things for people that [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=782.64s)]
*  benefit their lives, and if they know that you have that, they're going to want to flatter you so [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=789.68s)]
*  that there's a chance you're going to give those things to them, and obviously it just it makes [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=793.36s)]
*  people in that situation so detached from reality and so enamored of themselves just because all [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=799.92s)]
*  their influences are telling them that they are brilliant and that they're genius and that they see [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=808.96s)]
*  things people don't see, and sometimes that may be true. There are probably billionaires, I guess I [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=813.6s)]
*  know a couple who I would consider extremely smart, but the majority of them, including ones [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=818.48s)]
*  I've worked with, I can tell you I'm not going to say they're dumb, they're mediocre, sometimes [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=824.72s)]
*  I have like an idiot savant skill that turned into a company that just, you know, exploded at the [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=831.12s)]
*  right time. Everyone's success has partly some luck, you have to be in the right place at the right time, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=836.24s)]
*  and a lot of these people who walk around thinking they're brilliant and have the power with their [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=843.28s)]
*  billions of dollars to bring those visions to fruition and to convince people that they should [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=847.28s)]
*  are not even remotely close to as smart as they think, and so when they start getting these visions [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=853.04s)]
*  and everyone around them tells them how brilliant they are and everything about their lives is [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=859.68s)]
*  reinforcing their own brilliance, I do think that can be a very twisted and dangerous dynamic, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=863.4399999999999s)]
*  and then there is this very specific billionaire culture, especially the ones that came out of [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=870.4s)]
*  Silicon Valley, that believes that they are the kinds of people who society ought to progress and [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=876.48s)]
*  evolve and transform into, and that the society just doesn't facilitate that. The society punishes [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=888.64s)]
*  success, it impedes transformative kind of ubermensch, to use a Nietzschean term, expression, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=896.08s)]
*  and they have ideas like they want to just start new societies, they want to like buy a country or [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=905.12s)]
*  buy so much land that it can become its own country and they just create a society from scratch where [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=911.04s)]
*  they're the overlords and they create rules and obviously it then extends to like maybe we shouldn't [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=915.6s)]
*  even do it on earth, let's start our own society on Mars or wherever, and it becomes this very [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=921.68s)]
*  utopian and dystopian vision driven by a tiny number of people who have no real pushback or [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=926.4s)]
*  tension between the things that come out of their mouths, from their brains into their mouths, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=936.8s)]
*  and then they can try and make reality and have the power to make reality, that a lot of that is, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=941.6s)]
*  very alarming, we ought to be very very very skeptical of that even in the cases where it [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=946.8000000000001s)]
*  might be promising, and finally I would say that, and a lot of this just depends on what you think, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=951.12s)]
*  if you're completely a nihilist and an atheist and you just believe everything is just kind of [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=959.44s)]
*  nihilistic evolution, no purpose, no spirit, no soul, we just keep evolving, keep evolving over [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=967.76s)]
*  millions of years and human beings is just, where we are now is just one stop along the way and our [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=976.08s)]
*  next destination is something totally different, it probably wouldn't bother you, but if you have [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=981.2s)]
*  a kind of idea of something essentialist about being human, then you're going to be able to [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=986.48s)]
*  you have a kind of idea of something essentialist about being human, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=992.64s)]
*  that turning us into beings that exist in an AI vat and eliminating us, every part of us except [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=998.48s)]
*  our intellect, that that may not be an advancement, that there may be a destruction of humanity while [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=1007.6s)]
*  maintaining the facade of it, this is the kind of stuff that I think requires a great deal of [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=1013.9200000000001s)]
*  introspection, a great deal of thought, a great deal of debate involving the whole society, [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=1019.92s)]
*  but because billionaires have this ability to just push things along with no constraints, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=1024.3999999999999s)]
*  how AI is just exploding really with no safeguards, I mean there's some superficial safeguards, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=1027.92s)]
*  like if you use chat GPT or the commercial ones, they don't let it do certain things that it could [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=1034.48s)]
*  easily do, but you can imagine how it's actually being developed and the people who don't want [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=1039.52s)]
*  those safeguards to exist are using AI without those safeguards, none of this is being understood, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=1045.6s)]
*  none of this is being analyzed or studied and I'm not an alarmist at all about technology even [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=1051.36s)]
*  including AI, but I think it's more this kind of narcissism and this self-adoration that naturally [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=1058.32s)]
*  develops in billionaires that gives them far too much confidence in their own ability to push [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=1069.84s)]
*  humanity into directions that they think it should go and really don't need much debate in order to [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=1076.3999999999999s)]
*  do it because their brains are sufficiently advanced to make those decisions and see those [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=1081.4399999999998s)]
*  things on their own and the proof is that they became billionaires, that's how the reasoning [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=1086.8s)]
*  works, that I think is the most dangerous dynamic rather than the specific things and yeah when Peter [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=1090.8s)]
*  Teal starts saying, I'm not sure humanity should continue, okay I'll say yes just because you [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=1096.72s)]
*  obviously think it's extremely creepy if I don't but I'm going to add that like maybe we should [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=1102.24s)]
*  exist in some other form, that I think people are, I hope people are disturbed by that, I'm not saying [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=1107.2s)]
*  necessarily opposed to it but I hope they're disturbed by it in a way that they kind of demand [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=1114.32s)]
*  some some time and reflection in order to consider. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrcjmus-oXU&t=1117.92s)]
