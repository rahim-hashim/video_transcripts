# Trump's Real Tariff Goal?
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [April 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A)
*  I want to ask you about the tear up debate at the time we up left because you know especially [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=0.0s)]
*  when you started I always thought of you as a reporter who reports on economic issues, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  domestic debates. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  Before you were at the intercept, before you and I even knew each other, you kind of attacked [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=20.16s)]
*  me once over some union issue. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=23.44s)]
*  I forget what it was but we had a little back and forth that was mostly pejorative [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=26.24s)]
*  and it was about economic issues, something that you've really been focused on is like [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=31.919999999999998s)]
*  the trail of money and politics and all of that. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=35.839999999999996s)]
*  So I just want to tell you what I'm finding a little bit difficult to process about this [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=38.8s)]
*  whole tariff explosion over the last week which is that for as long as I can remember [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=44.28s)]
*  The view of the left, the mainstream left and even parts of the liberal wing of the [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=50.18s)]
*  Democratic Party was that free trade is evil, it's destructive. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=56.220000000000006s)]
*  People on the left hated the Clintons principally because of NAFTA and their support in general [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=63.7s)]
*  for free trade then under vomit became the TPP which Hillary Clinton supported as well. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=68.9s)]
*  This was the ruination of the country, of the middle class, the working class was free [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=73.82000000000001s)]
*  trade and the elimination of protectionism and all of that. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=78.1s)]
*  Ross Perot proved right that all these jobs went overseas. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=83.46s)]
*  All the deindustrialized towns you were talking about that recently when you were traveling [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=87.3s)]
*  in the Midwest and other places and you saw how devastated these towns were. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=90.38s)]
*  This is a serious problem that people on the left and even more close to the mainstream [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=96.86s)]
*  wing of the Democratic Party always understood, always maintained, always argued. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=102.53999999999999s)]
*  I get that Donald Trump's scheme of tariffs is not necessarily what anyone else would [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=107.10000000000001s)]
*  have planned. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=112.10000000000001s)]
*  It was very haphazard, seemed a little arbitrary. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=113.10000000000001s)]
*  You can make the argument that a kind of blunderbuss, like heavy imposition of tariffs is necessary [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=115.82000000000001s)]
*  to really try and reverse this economic system. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=121.56s)]
*  But I'm just wondering what you make of the fact that the argument that Trump was making, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=125.18s)]
*  that Scott Benson was making, that Peter Navarro was making was, look we don't care if the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=130.22s)]
*  stock market's angry. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=135.34s)]
*  We have accommodated the stock market and rich people and Wall Street long enough. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=136.84s)]
*  It's time to now enact policies for the working class, for the people whose towns, as you [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=141.12s)]
*  described them, have been devastated. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=146.36s)]
*  And to do that we have to reverse free trade and globalism and return to a kind of economic [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=148.04s)]
*  system where manufacturing in our country can thrive. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=154.2s)]
*  What do you make of that whole debate? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=158.16s)]
*  I think it's just kind of a classic Trump dynamic where he's directionally right. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=161.12s)]
*  He's calling attention to an issue that both parties have ignored or have really made worse [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=166.72s)]
*  over the last couple of decades. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=171.88s)]
*  But in his actual application in pursuit of the policy, he's not achieving the stated [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=174.32s)]
*  goals. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=180.04s)]
*  Let me give you an example. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=181.04s)]
*  Tariffs are part of an industrial policy. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=183.6s)]
*  In the last two years, Texas Instrument, one of the big chip makers in America, announced [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=186.52s)]
*  that they would spend the next five or six years building new manufacturing plants to [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=192.0s)]
*  reshore chip building. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=196.72s)]
*  In part that was driven by the Chips Act, the Biden policy. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=198.68s)]
*  What happened? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=203.8s)]
*  You had a number of Wall Street investors, including Paul Singer, a major hedge fund [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=205.0s)]
*  manager who gave big to Trump last year, he's a big Trump ally, taking an activist stake, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=209.88s)]
*  shares in Texas Instrument and demanding that they go back on that plan, that they continue [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=216.88s)]
*  building ships in other countries so that they can create more shareholder value, more [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=222.96s)]
*  profits. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=226.8s)]
*  Creating industrial policy to bring factories back, to bring manufacturing back, to bring [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=227.8s)]
*  high quality jobs to the Midwest and Rust Belt and other neglected parts of this country, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=234.44s)]
*  really all corners of this country, that's a good goal. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=239.84s)]
*  But that's not what's happening. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=242.96s)]
*  Trump has really completely ignored or handed gifts to Wall Street, given these blanket [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=245.12s)]
*  pardons to any kind of corporate criminal. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=251.51999999999998s)]
*  If your goal is to do this only with tariffs, it's not going to work. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=254.48s)]
*  Even if he's just pursuing with tariffs with no labor policy, no kind of fiscal policy, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=257.92s)]
*  no kind of new arrangement with Wall Street, he needs allies. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=263.0s)]
*  If anything, he's alienated the world, threatening Canada, threatening Greenland, threatening [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=267.4s)]
*  the EU, threatening Latin America and Mexico, and then expecting them to work with the US [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=272.64s)]
*  in this anti-China policy. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=279.08s)]
*  One day it's about bringing jobs home, and then the next day it's about raising revenue. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=281.68s)]
*  The goals keep changing. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=288.24s)]
*  If the goal is bringing back manufacturing, I think that's a wonderful kind of top line [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=291.28s)]
*  effort, but it's not what's being pursued here with these kind of manic tariffs that have [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=298.4s)]
*  disrupted the stock market. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=305.84s)]
*  If he's just giving away these exemptions, which is a huge opportunity for political [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=308.71999999999997s)]
*  corruption, SpaceX has already asked for exemptions. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=315.12s)]
*  Many other companies that trade with China are asking for exemptions. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=319.91999999999996s)]
*  I think that's going to be a very interesting area to watch. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=322.64s)]
*  If your goal is to bring back manufacturing, these tariffs have to be a kind of unified [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=325.44s)]
*  strategy where the US works with allies and a methodical plan that's long term. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=330.71999999999997s)]
*  If you're going to build a new factory in the US, you have to have the certainty that [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=336.64s)]
*  these tariffs are going to be there for many years to come and there won't be exemptions. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=340.0s)]
*  If you look at the behavior of the last two weeks, there's no indicators that that's [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=344.71999999999997s)]
*  what's going to happen. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=349.67999999999995s)]
*  So if anything, I'm concerned that the chaos out of these policy moves are only going to [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=351.28000000000003s)]
*  discredit efforts for a new industrial policy where high tech manufacturing jobs are brought [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=359.04s)]
*  back to America. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=364.96000000000004s)]
*  Let me just ask you one question about that because we're out of time because we have an [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=365.76s)]
*  extremely important guest, extremely important guest who's already waiting on the line. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=368.8s)]
*  His name is Michael Tracy. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=373.44s)]
*  He has an extremely busy calendar. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=374.64000000000004s)]
*  I don't like to keep him waiting. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=376.08000000000004s)]
*  Well, I've heard of him, yeah. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=377.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=378.08000000000004s)]
*  Have you heard of him? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=378.32s)]
*  He's like a bundle of positivity and he hates to be contentious. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=380.32s)]
*  I'm really looking forward to spending some time with him. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=384.24s)]
*  So I'm going to have to let you go in a second. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=386.08s)]
*  But before I do, I just want to ask you about what you just said, which is Trump's argument [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=387.52s)]
*  now and for sure it has shifted and changed even in the last week is look, far from alienating [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=392.32s)]
*  the world, actually the opposite is true. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=400.0s)]
*  Every country in the world is calling me asking to do a deal like, hey, can we come to [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=402.96000000000004s)]
*  Washington? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=407.2s)]
*  Can we do a deal with you? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=407.68s)]
*  And his argument is that, and I haven't really heard an alternative for people who don't [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=409.28s)]
*  like Trump's plan as to how the manufacturing base could be revitalized. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=414.4s)]
*  I'm not saying you have to present one to criticize Trump's, but his argument is that [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=417.91999999999996s)]
*  what we're going to get with these countries is not just the elimination of tariffs, but [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=422.64s)]
*  Trump wants to require they invest in the United States. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=427.03999999999996s)]
*  They commit to opening up a certain number of factories in the United States, that they [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=430.15999999999997s)]
*  produce their products in the US. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=433.44s)]
*  If that really is his goal, if that really is what's happening, if he can facilitate [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=436.32s)]
*  that with major countries like, I don't know, Vietnam or countries in Europe, why would [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=442.24s)]
*  that not work? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=449.44s)]
*  Well, is that even the goal? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=451.84s)]
*  We heard from Peter Navarro last Sunday and Monday that the goal was a higher trade surplus, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=456.71999999999997s)]
*  that Vietnam needs to simply buy more American goods. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=463.76s)]
*  Now it's moving factories to the US. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=466.8s)]
*  I mean, those are different goals, right? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=468.48s)]
*  There were also goals from Howard Lotnick last weekend where he claimed that, or I'm [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=470.56s)]
*  sorry, from Scott Bessett last weekend that he claimed that this was part of a strategy [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=476.08s)]
*  to save the US interest payments when they refinance the debt by driving down the rates [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=480.48s)]
*  for US treasuries. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=487.28s)]
*  Well, is that still a goal? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=488.48s)]
*  Because now US treasury notes are exploding in value. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=489.92s)]
*  The goals have changed and there have been four or five different things this week. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=493.76s)]
*  Again, if this was a unified government plan and an implementation of that plan to bring [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=499.28000000000003s)]
*  jobs back and to bring high paid manufacturing jobs to the US, I would have no problem with [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=509.12s)]
*  that. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=515.52s)]
*  There would be no criticism. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=516.4s)]
*  But it's just not clear if that's what the goal is. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=517.52s)]
*  The opportunities for corruption where they sell off tariff exemptions without actually [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=520.16s)]
*  creating any new factories seems very apparent. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=526.16s)]
*  All right. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HebIVKh9r3A&t=529.92s)]
