# Shocking U.S./Brazil Case: Did Biden Admin's CBP Fabricate Docs to Frame Bolsonaro Adviser?
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [April 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8)
*  I follow Brazilian politics very closely. I've been involved in Brazilian politics as a journalist and my husband was a member of the Brazilian Congress. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=0.0s)]
*  So it's something that we follow very closely. Lived in Brazil for a while. And so it's something that is obviously a main focus of mine. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=13.8s)]
*  I have a I write for the country's largest newspaper, Folha of São Paulo, where I do a lot of reporting. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=23.84s)]
*  But I really try not to talk about Brazilian politics per se on this show unless it really does have major international implications. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=28.8s)]
*  We talked a lot about Brazil's really unequaled censorship scheme because of the way that jeopardizes free speech in the broader West. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=37.0s)]
*  Every time one country in the democratic world goes further, it's a sign or a signal that other countries can as well. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=43.84s)]
*  And there is a case now in the federal court that really does have major implications, not really for Brazil, but for the United States. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=50.72s)]
*  Because the question is whether the Biden administration fabricated immigration documents in order to help Brazil's authoritarian censorship judge, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=58.32s)]
*  Alexander de Marais, justify the baseless imprisonment of one of Jair Bolsonaro's top officials, his foreign policy adviser, Felipe Martins, whose imprisonment we've reported on before. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=70.2s)]
*  Now, I just want to tell you a little bit about the case. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=85.24000000000001s)]
*  You understand what the implications are for the United States, how this could genuinely be an explosive scandal if this is proven. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=86.64s)]
*  I'm not saying it will be proven, but there's certainly a lot of grounds as the federal court in the United States that's now looking into this has obviously concluded as well to believe that something extremely strange, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=92.88s)]
*  if not corrupt, happened here with American immigration records. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=105.04s)]
*  Now, first of all, Felipe Martins was arrested in Brazil in February of 2024. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=110.04s)]
*  Here you see the headline in Folha of São Paulo. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=119.48s)]
*  At the time, it says the federal police targets Bolsonaro, Vladimir, former ministers and military officers in cooperation with the coup attempt. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=122.72s)]
*  Targets include various people. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=130.32s)]
*  And the key here is that Felipe Martins was never charged with a crime. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=133.12s)]
*  He was being investigated for what Marais says was his suspicion that Felipe Martins participated in a plan that would have led to the coup if Bolsonaro lost the election. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=138.12s)]
*  That's the allegation against him at the time he was not charged. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=149.68s)]
*  And yet he was nonetheless ordered to be arrested by Alexandre de Marais. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=154.96s)]
*  Now, the interesting part about this was when Felipe Martins was arrested, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=162.56s)]
*  the argument was that the reason he needed to be arrested, even though there were no charges pending against him, is because, said Marais in the Brazilian court, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=176.16s)]
*  Felipe Martins had left Brazil when Bolsonaro left Brazil. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=186.6s)]
*  You may remember that Bolsonaro right after the day before, the last day of his presidency, the day before it was to be inaugurated in 2022, left Brazil for the United States. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=190.28s)]
*  He ended up staying in the United States, in Orlando for six months, three months or six months, one of those. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=199.92000000000002s)]
*  And then he came back. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=206.72s)]
*  And the court said that this top adviser, Felipe Martins, went with him to the United States, entered the United States. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=208.56s)]
*  But then he, in the words of the court, evaporated. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=218.35999999999999s)]
*  He just disappeared because there was no record of him leaving the United States and coming back into Brazil, even though they knew he was in Brazil. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=220.92s)]
*  So they said, look, this proves that he can just disappear. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=227.64s)]
*  Like he's like the invisible man. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=230.68s)]
*  And that shows that he can flee justice at any time. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=233.48s)]
*  So we have to put him in prison while this investigation is ongoing because of what he did. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=235.92s)]
*  He left Brazil, entered the United States, but somehow came back without leaving a trace of having done so. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=240.56s)]
*  The whole thing was a lie, an absolute, provable, demonstrable lie. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=248.84s)]
*  I spent months working on this case and there was a mountain of evidence proving that Felipe Martins never left Brazil. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=253.56s)]
*  He was in Brazil the whole time. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=262.84000000000003s)]
*  He just never went with Bolsonaro to the US. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=265.52s)]
*  None of this ever happened. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=268.03999999999996s)]
*  Just to give you a couple of examples, a week after he was alleged to have gone to the US with Bolsonaro, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=270.71999999999997s)]
*  Felipe Martins flew on a domestic flight inside Brazil and the court got those records. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=278.2s)]
*  It was a Brazilian Airlines. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=283.79999999999995s)]
*  He flew from one city in Brazil to the other. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=285.24s)]
*  A week after he was said to have gone to the United States. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=287.64s)]
*  So just on that alone, they knew he was in Brazil. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=292.12s)]
*  They had iFood receipts and credit card charges, his phone records, mountains of surveillance data [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=294.76000000000005s)]
*  that the federal police obtained showing that he was in Brazil the whole time. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=302.28000000000003s)]
*  There you see from wall one of the Brazilian outlets while he was in prison. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=308.68s)]
*  Felipe Martins presents iFood receipts, an airline ticket in order to argue that his imprisonment should be overturned. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=313.0s)]
*  The fact that this was such a lie from the start was incredibly obvious. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=319.6s)]
*  I mean, I would not have written an article arguing that he was wrongfully imprisoned [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=326.04s)]
*  unless I was truly convinced with certainty that he was in Brazil long. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=333.56s)]
*  And I saw this evidence. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=337.56s)]
*  I worked with his lawyer and I ended up writing this article. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=338.88s)]
*  This was in August of 2024. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=342.72s)]
*  So basically, five months into six months into his imprisonment, I wrote an article in Folha. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=344.48s)]
*  They are there you see it in Portuguese. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=350.96000000000004s)]
*  But the headline of that translated is Brazil Bolsonaro's former advisor is imprisoned based on a false allegation. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=354.08000000000004s)]
*  Alexandre de Marais ignores evidence proving that Felipe Martins did not try to flee Brazil at the end of 2022. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=361.92s)]
*  And what was amazing about this was that the evidence was so immediately apparent that [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=369.08s)]
*  Felipe Martins never left Brazil and came to the United States that even his prosecutors, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=376.96s)]
*  who are part of the government under Willa da Silva, even they right after he was imprisoned and then again in May, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=384.0s)]
*  went to the Supreme Court and said, look, we don't think he should be in prison. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=395.08000000000004s)]
*  There's we realize now there's no evidence that justifies this allegation that he left Brazil and evaporated. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=399.08000000000004s)]
*  He was in Brazil the whole time. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=404.20000000000005s)]
*  Even his own prosecutors were arguing that. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=405.92s)]
*  And Marais twice ignored them and just rejected that petition to release him. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=409.0s)]
*  And here you see from CNN Brazil, May of 2024, Marais rejects a new request for release and keeps Felipe Martins in prison. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=412.44s)]
*  The prosecutor has already spoken out in favor of the release of Bolsonaro's former advisor. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=421.16s)]
*  Quote, the arrest was based on the argument that Felipe Martins left Brazil aboard a presidential plane on November on December 30th, 2022. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=425.28000000000003s)]
*  With then President Jair Bolsonaro, the attorney general's office has already expressed itself for the release of Martins on March 1st, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=432.72s)]
*  a month into his imprisonment. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=442.72s)]
*  In the most recent motion submitted on April 23rd, the defense indicated what it considers a new and relevant piece of evidence to prove [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=444.6s)]
*  that Felipe Martins did not, in fact, leave the country on the presidential plane that departed Brazil for the United States on December 30th, 2022. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=450.96s)]
*  It is a response from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, part of the Department of Homeland Security, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=460.12s)]
*  the agency responsible for the entry of foreigners into the United States to a request from the defense regarding Martins entry and records into the country. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=464.91999999999996s)]
*  The U.S. agency stated its system contains no record of Martins entering Orlando on December 30th, 2022. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=473.0s)]
*  The date when Bolsonaro and his entourage landed in the country, it also confirmed that his last recorded entry in the U.S. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=479.88s)]
*  was in September of 2022 via New York. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=485.84s)]
*  So he never even entered the U.S. until two months before they claim he did. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=489.48s)]
*  And then he came back. He just never went to the U.S. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=494.4s)]
*  And the evidence was overwhelming in this regard. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=496.48s)]
*  Here is the headline where the prosecutors again went back in August, which is when I wrote my article saying, again, the prosecutors, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=501.88s)]
*  the attorney general office, request his release precisely because there was no evidence and all the evidence that was available disproved Marais's argument that he disappeared and therefore had to be in prison. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=509.0s)]
*  He kept him in prison for six months. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=520.16s)]
*  The reason they wanted him in prison and they've done this many times before they imprison people and they say you're not going to get out unless you start turning on Bolsonaro and his top aides. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=523.0s)]
*  And if you admit that they actually did a coup and you participated in it, we'll let you out. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=535.72s)]
*  But if you don't, we're going to keep you in prison. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=540.12s)]
*  So even knowing the whole imprisonment was based on a false accusation, they kept him in prison anyway. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=542.6s)]
*  Now, what the key event here that happened is after all that evidence was demonstrated. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=550.44s)]
*  That he never left Brazil and after the Customs and Border Patrol said we have no record of him entering Brazil, suddenly in the middle of his imprisonment, somehow in the Customs and Border Patrol system, there was created or there emerged out of nowhere a record that country with the said previously now said, oh, yeah, we actually do have a. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=558.6s)]
*  Entry record in our system for Philippe Martins. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=585.24s)]
*  And that was when Marais said, oh, look, even now, the Border Protection Agency in the US says, yes, he did enter the US, but that he actually never left. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=590.6s)]
*  It just it got manufactured out of nowhere and then Marais used that to justify it. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=600.28s)]
*  Here's the US Customs and Border Protection record, the first one that was. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=605.64s)]
*  That was produced that appeared in the middle of all this. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=612.28s)]
*  This is the Customs and Border Protection Agency under Joe Biden. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=616.1199999999999s)]
*  And here they report to have the most recent entry date into the United States of December 30th, 2022. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=620.52s)]
*  That's when that President of pain with Bolsonaro came to United States. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=627.3199999999999s)]
*  Suddenly they had, oh, no, I don't know. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=631.4799999999999s)]
*  We do have a record of him entering the United States. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=633.0s)]
*  On exactly that date. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=635.24s)]
*  And then I said, oh, look, he got some reporter extremely close to the Supreme Court that serves as their spokesman, especially Marais published an article. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=638.12s)]
*  Oh, there is now an immigration record showing that he entered the US and evaporated even though before there wasn't. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=648.36s)]
*  And this record was so bizarre, not just because it appeared out of nowhere, but because it's so many mistakes in it. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=654.52s)]
*  For example, it misspelled his first name. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=661.48s)]
*  There you see the American spelling of Felipe. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=664.28s)]
*  F-E-L-I-P-E. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=667.0s)]
*  His name is actually F-I-L-I-P-E. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=668.6s)]
*  So they misspelled his name. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=671.0799999999999s)]
*  They also had here a passport number that was actually an old passport number right here. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=673.3199999999999s)]
*  This was an invalid passport from years before that he hadn't used. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=684.6s)]
*  And also it had him entering on a type of visa that he never had and never used. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=689.32s)]
*  It's like three very clear mistakes on this document that appeared out of nowhere. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=694.6800000000001s)]
*  Then once they started interrogating and saying, what is this document? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=701.32s)]
*  Where did it come from? [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=705.16s)]
*  How did you get that? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=706.36s)]
*  They started kind of backtracking. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=707.64s)]
*  And what they did was first they took all three of those errors that Felipe Martins' lawyer said, how can this be a real record? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=709.88s)]
*  It has three errors. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=718.92s)]
*  And they just quietly changed it retroactively in the system. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=719.9599999999999s)]
*  So now they spelled his name correctly. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=723.3199999999999s)]
*  They changed the document number to reflect his document number and change the type of visa they said he entered on. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=725.4s)]
*  They just retroactively changed the immigration records quietly with no note that they had done so. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=733.88s)]
*  And then as more pressure was put on them saying, what is all this? [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=741.16s)]
*  They finally changed the record to reflect the reality, which was that his most recent entry into the United States was actually in September of 2022. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=745.64s)]
*  So two months before that Bolsonaro plane went, he clearly was not on it. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=757.4799999999999s)]
*  They had his name right, his passport right. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=762.1199999999999s)]
*  But you see they just they eliminated that record saying that he entered at the end of December, which is what the whole basis was for his imprisonment. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=764.5999999999999s)]
*  So why were these immigration records and customs and border in the United States trifled with, played with, and potentially fabricated at exactly the time that Marais needed some evidence to keep him in prison? [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=774.0400000000001s)]
*  One thing I can tell you is there are a lot of Brazilians who work in the United States, who live in the United States, who have become citizens of the United States, but obviously pay a lot of attention to Brazil, Brazilian politics. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=790.12s)]
*  And there's a lot of them who work there. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=801.32s)]
*  I know it Martins lawyer one time called the Orlando Customs and Border Patrol where this came from, and they ended up speaking to the person who was responsible or overseeing this. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=804.6800000000001s)]
*  And he had a clear Brazilian or Portuguese accent in English. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=814.2s)]
*  So there's a lot of mystery here. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=818.28s)]
*  And not just mystery, but a lot of basis for suspicion. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=820.52s)]
*  Obviously, if someone's going in, if the Customs Border Patrol can go in and start manipulating immigration records or changing them or just erasing data, that's a huge national security threat. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=827.5600000000001s)]
*  These are the records that tells us who comes into the country when they come in. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=840.44s)]
*  And if somebody committed immigration fraud of this kind, if somebody created fabricated records in this system for purely political reasons to help keep a Bolsonaro advisor, who the Biden administration obviously hated lots of people, hate the Bolsonaro movement, all that helped this judge, Judge Marais, unjustly keep someone in prison. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=844.92s)]
*  And that's something people should go to prison for in the United States. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=868.1999999999999s)]
*  That's forgery. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=873.24s)]
*  That's fraud. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=874.76s)]
*  Here from the Folio of Sao Paulo too, as the investigation went on, as he was in prison, just more evidence. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=875.9599999999999s)]
*  July of 2024, cell phone data shows that Martins was in Brazil during Bolsonaro's stay in the US. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=884.36s)]
*  Information by CHIME, which is the big cell phone carrier in Brazil to the Supreme Federal Court, proves he did not travel with the former president. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=891.08s)]
*  And they knew this very close to the beginning. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=902.04s)]
*  In fact, right after the, after Lula was inaugurated, right, just a couple weeks after Felipe Martins supposedly went to the US with Bolsonaro and then disappeared. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=904.52s)]
*  They submitted a Freedom of Information Act request, the equivalent of that, to the government, which by this point was run by Lula. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=920.2s)]
*  And they said, request for information about the flight to Miami that transported the former president of the republic, Jair Bolsonaro, among others. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=930.36s)]
*  And the government said the official delegation on the plane was composed of, and they list the people, former president Jair Bolsonaro, his wife, the former first lady. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=938.36s)]
*  And you just go through that list. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=947.0s)]
*  And Felipe Martins is not on it. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=949.08s)]
*  This was available a year before Marais ordered him imprisoned. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=951.0s)]
*  He just wasn't on the plane. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=956.52s)]
*  He never was on the plane. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=957.64s)]
*  He never left Brazil. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=958.52s)]
*  So now what has happened is they have filed a lawsuit. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=961.96s)]
*  If we can pull that up. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=968.52s)]
*  Felipe Martins and his lawyers did file a lawsuit in the federal district court in Orlando. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=970.28s)]
*  There you see the lawsuit in the middle district of Florida, Felipe Martins against the US Department of Homeland Security and the United States Customs and Border Protection, raising all these issues, showing the federal court, look, there's good reason to believe that something very untoward happened here. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=975.56s)]
*  And we want discovery to find out how this false document emerged in the middle of his imprisonment right when the prosecutors were saying release him. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=992.68s)]
*  All the evidence proves he never left Brazil. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1002.5999999999999s)]
*  He was in Brazil the whole time. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1004.92s)]
*  Conclusive, decisive evidence. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1006.92s)]
*  And then suddenly this thing appears in the middle of the custom border patrol system when previously they had no record of him entering. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1009.0799999999999s)]
*  And then that became the foundation, the basis for keeping him imprisoned. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1016.28s)]
*  Here was that reporter who serves the agenda of the Supreme Court who published several false articles, one of which had to be heavily retracted about how he left the United States. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1021.32s)]
*  It's from Metropolis. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1030.52s)]
*  His name is Givermi Armado. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1031.88s)]
*  And there you see the title of the lawsuit. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1033.88s)]
*  It's the first time in a long time that he's been arrested. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1036.36s)]
*  He was arrested in the United States. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1038.52s)]
*  He was arrested in the United States. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1040.52s)]
*  And there you see the title which is under investigation, Felipe Martins has a recorded entry in the United States and then vanished. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1043.16s)]
*  A document on a US government website state that Felipe Martins entered Orlando at the end of 2022. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1051.8799999999999s)]
*  Again, this is June. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1059.6399999999999s)]
*  This is four months after he was first ordered in prison or five months. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1060.68s)]
*  This is the article that appeals under a journalist well known to be aligned with Marais, who is basically a spokesman. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1064.12s)]
*  He's like, oh, look what I found. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1071.0s)]
*  A Custom and Border record, a new one. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1073.0s)]
*  A year into this whole thing. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1075.96s)]
*  That now suddenly shows, oh no, he did actually enter the US. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1078.44s)]
*  And then they had to retract it. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1082.6s)]
*  They say, quote, the first version of the headline for this article was, under investigation, Bolsonaro's former advisor went to Orlando in 2022 and vanished. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1086.04s)]
*  This column understood based on information available from the public consultation of Felipe Martins I-94 entry form that Martins had traveled to Orlando on December 30th, 2022. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1095.64s)]
*  At the time, the column made extensive efforts to contact Martins, but he never responded. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1107.08s)]
*  Months later, Martins provided information to the Supreme Court showing that he was in Brazil on that date, which suggests that the US government website contained incorrect information. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1111.48s)]
*  They even had to admit it, the people who were desperate to keep him in prison, because it was so provably false. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1122.9199999999998s)]
*  So even this reporter who found this record and said, oh, look, this proves he evaporated, came to the US and evaporated, now had to go back and retract the entire story. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1128.1999999999998s)]
*  Saying that, quote, the US government website contained incorrect information, though we have never received a response from Martins' lawyers. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1138.04s)]
*  In the interest of accuracy, the column made this correction. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1145.1599999999999s)]
*  We understand it was necessary because as of the publication date of this text based on the I-94 data, the most accurate statement would have only been that there was a received entry, not that he had, in fact, traveled to the United States. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1149.0s)]
*  I mean, this is, regardless of why this happened, this is a massive scandal because you cannot have radically incorrect information in the US Customs and Border System about entry into the United States. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1163.08s)]
*  Again, it's a huge national security problem. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1179.08s)]
*  That is the border. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1181.08s)]
*  That's what's supposed to keep out people to tell the United States government who enters. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1182.04s)]
*  And I guess it's possible sometimes mistakes get made in bureaucracies, but this would be an extremely coincidental mistake that exactly at the time when the Supreme Court Judge Marais knew that Felipe Martins had never left Brazil, that all this information that he long had even before he ordered Martins in prison, including federal police surveillance, all kinds of receipts showing that he was in Brazil the whole time, it was dispositive. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1186.12s)]
*  Even the prosecutor admitted suddenly at the exact right time, this Customs and Border Protection form in the United States emerges in their system, showing exactly what Marais needed it to show in order to justify his ongoing imprisonment. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1214.1999999999998s)]
*  And it is really remarkable. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1230.1999999999998s)]
*  The whole case is remarkable. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1236.1999999999998s)]
*  The involvement of the United States is remarkable. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1238.28s)]
*  Whether there was evidence to believe that the US Customs and Border Protection participated corruptly in these events or just recklessly, either way, this should be a matter of great interest to the US Congress, to American policymakers, to investigators. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1244.28s)]
*  Now, fortunately, we have this judge in the United States who, as I said, is a Clinton-appointed judge, but clearly based on his commentary thus far on this lawsuit, it's only pending for a short amount of time. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1259.36s)]
*  But he's already shown at least some degree of sympathy, some degree of concern about what really happened here. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1273.36s)]
*  Here's Foley on April 2nd of this year reporting on the court case in the US. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1283.4399999999998s)]
*  The US court schedules a hearing in the case alleging fraud in the entry of Bolsonaro's former advisor into the country. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1289.52s)]
*  Felipe Martins, one of those indicted by Brazil's Attorney General's Office, will be heard on April 9th in Orlando. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1295.52s)]
*  Quote, the hearing will aim to clarify what the former advisor's defense sees as signs of fraud in the US immigration records. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1301.6s)]
*  The records appeared in April 2024 during his imprisonment and were deleted in July of the same year. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1309.6s)]
*  I just want to stress, this newspaper, this is where I work, they are not pro-Bolsonaro, to put it mildly. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1317.6s)]
*  It's like the New York Times of Brazil. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1325.6s)]
*  I personally consider them to be the most journalistically fair mainstream outlet in Brazil. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1327.6799999999998s)]
*  That's why I work with them. I've worked with them for many years. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1335.6799999999998s)]
*  I did a little bit of Snowden reporting with them as it pertained to Brazil. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1337.6799999999998s)]
*  I did the investigation of the anti-corruption probe in Brazil this past year when I got the archive from Marais' chambers, [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1341.6799999999998s)]
*  along with a reporter there. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1351.76s)]
*  They very aggressively publish every story on the front page, even though Marais is a sacred figure in Brazil. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1353.76s)]
*  They're not supposed to criticize him. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1357.76s)]
*  I really respect the editors of this paper, but they are still pro-Bolsonaro, anti-Bolsonaro editorially. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1359.76s)]
*  This is what they're saying as a news article, that suddenly it appeared in April, right when he was in prison, [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1369.76s)]
*  and then was deleted in July of the same year. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1379.84s)]
*  And then Marais released him in August, two weeks after my article, when it became clear that this was a scam. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1381.84s)]
*  It goes on, quote, [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1391.84s)]
*  The former advisor to Bolsonaro is one of the individuals indicted in the alleged coup plot said to have been orchestrated by Jair Bolsonaro. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1393.84s)]
*  According to a statement by Judge Gregory Presnel, Martins may attend the session either in person or remotely. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1399.84s)]
*  And then after that article, the judge actually authorized discovery to take place. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1407.9199999999998s)]
*  Martins' lawyers have a right to request multiple documents relevant to understanding how this false immigration entry emerged right when it was politically convenient and necessary to do so. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1413.9199999999998s)]
*  And so discovery is going to take place. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1430.0s)]
*  I believe they have the right to depose officials at the Customs and Border Patrol as well to determine whether or not there was actual immigration fraud for political reasons to keep someone unjustly in prison who was disliked by the United States government. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1432.0s)]
*  Here's a new story. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1448.0s)]
*  Mexico extradites 29 drug traffickers to the U.S. to avoid trade tariffs. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1450.0s)]
*  We all know how deceptive corporate media can be. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1454.0s)]
*  They push gender, censor voices, and make sure you only see one side of the story. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1456.0s)]
*  That's exactly why I started this show, especially on Rumble, because I believe in free speech, real conversations that are unconstrained, and the best pursuit of the truth possible. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1458.08s)]
*  And that's why I've also partnered now with an app and website that believes in all of those values too. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1468.08s)]
*  Ground News prioritizes free speech over controlling the narrative. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1472.08s)]
*  For every story, news story, you can find all the articles reporting on it worldwide with context such as if a news source has any political biases, how credible they are, if any major corporation is influencing their role in the country. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1476.08s)]
*  And if I'm reporting, all I have to do is swipe through coverage of the news article with tags indicating if it's coming from a right-wing or a left-wing source or from corporations or independent voices. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1488.08s)]
*  And from there, I can decide for myself if Mexico's unprecedented extradition of 29 cartel members to the U.S. is proof that Trump's tariff tactics are working or, as some conservative voices claim, or if it's just a routine legal process like the center and left people there are claiming as well. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1498.08s)]
*  Different sources are saying different things. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1516.1599999999999s)]
*  If I had just read one, I'd have a completely skewed view of reality. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1518.1599999999999s)]
*  But with Ground News, I can put them side by side and decide for myself who's actually telling the truth. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1522.1599999999999s)]
*  Ground News even created a dedicated feed called Blind Spot that exposes stories that neither side of the political spectrum are reporting on, making it possible to spot stories that many people in charge don't want you to see. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1526.1599999999999s)]
*  Ground News is bringing back transparency in the news and civil discourse right from your phone or computer. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLXRKPB_vv8&t=1538.1599999999999s)]
