# Israel's LIES About Iran's Nuclear Program DEBUNKED
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [April 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo)
*  One of the things that you realize for the first time if you live outside the United [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=0.0s)]
*  States is just how aberrational it is for a country to constantly spend its time talking [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=9.96s)]
*  about which country it ought to go to war with next. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=15.26s)]
*  It's usually unheard of for most countries to even consider the possibility of a war [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=18.48s)]
*  with another country or bombing other countries or attacking other countries, let alone to [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=23.76s)]
*  actually do so. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=27.76s)]
*  In the United States we have an endless array, a really, literally endless array of military [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=29.48s)]
*  conflicts, bombing campaigns, wars, invasions, and all kinds of covert actions in other countries [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=34.92s)]
*  as well. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=41.64s)]
*  And it seems always like the public grows increasingly tired of that. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=42.64s)]
*  Poll after poll constantly demonstrates that people are eager for an end to endless war, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=46.84s)]
*  that these wars are not in the interest of American citizens or American interests. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=51.92s)]
*  People who get to run on a platform of being anti-war, of avoiding war, as Barack Obama [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=56.84s)]
*  did, as Donald Trump did, tend to do extremely well because they are telling the American [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=62.400000000000006s)]
*  people what they already want and believe, which is that these wars are being fought [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=67.98s)]
*  in a way that not only does it benefit their lives, but in so many ways undermines and [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=71.84s)]
*  subverts and prejudices it. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=77.08000000000001s)]
*  The war in Iraq is something that should have put an end to this forever. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=80.68s)]
*  It was the supreme expression of a war begun and sold based on falsehoods and lies, not [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=84.38s)]
*  just about the cause of the war, but also how the war would end up being prosecuted. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=91.69999999999999s)]
*  We were told, oh, it would be over in a few weeks. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=95.46s)]
*  We're so much more powerful than Iraq. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=97.86s)]
*  We're just going to remove the Saddam Hussein regime. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=99.78s)]
*  We're going to be welcomed as liberators. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=101.69999999999999s)]
*  It's going to be quick in and quick out. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=103.38s)]
*  And then we're going to have freedom and democracy spreading throughout the Middle East. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=105.66s)]
*  Absolutely none of that happened. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=110.06s)]
*  All the people who told us those things, which ended up disproven and debunked, didn't [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=112.5s)]
*  lose any stature at all in Washington if anything, they gained it and are more powerful than [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=117.86s)]
*  ever and that's why basically 20 years later, the same people are back and have been back [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=122.34s)]
*  for the last 20 years selling similar wars of regime change in Syria and Libya and getting [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=127.94s)]
*  us involved in all sorts of conflicts all around the world. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=134.3s)]
*  Obama bombed multiple, eight Muslim majority countries, killing all sorts of civilians, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=137.06s)]
*  generating anti-American hatred and instability. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=143.54s)]
*  We fought in Afghanistan for 20 years. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=147.18s)]
*  Soon as we left, the Taliban marched right back into power as though nothing had ever [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=148.94s)]
*  happened. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=152.42000000000002s)]
*  Iraq went from whatever else you think of Saddam Hussein, an actual adversary of Iran, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=154.66s)]
*  to basically being a proxy state of Iran, strengthening Iran, the country we were told [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=159.62s)]
*  is the greatest terrorist regime on the planet. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=163.86s)]
*  None of what we were told was going to happen actually happened and that's true for essentially [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=167.78s)]
*  every single one of these conflicts. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=172.22000000000003s)]
*  And yet every time there's an attempt to sell the US and American citizens into participating [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=175.34s)]
*  in or funding a new war as we're doing funding the Israeli destruction of Gaza, as we're [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=180.9s)]
*  funding the Ukraine war with Russia, the propaganda is very intense. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=185.34s)]
*  All you have to do is keep people's fear level high enough for a certain period of time to [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=190.06s)]
*  get them to sign on or emotionally manipulate them enough to get them to sign on and once [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=193.66s)]
*  they do, even if a few months later or a year later they start regretting it, the war just [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=198.62s)]
*  continues without any end in sight and the current target, clearly, openly, if you pay [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=203.06s)]
*  attention to the news at all, you would know, is a new war with Iran. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=210.62s)]
*  It's being sold just like the war in Iraq in the sense that, oh, this is a very limited [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=216.34s)]
*  war, don't worry. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=220.01999999999998s)]
*  It's not going to be a full on years long war. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=221.18s)]
*  It's going to go bomb a few other nuclear reactors or Israel is going to do it and we're [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=223.22s)]
*  going to help them. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=228.62s)]
*  And all the fear mongering, oh, Saddam Hussein was on the verge of getting nuclear weapons, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=231.14000000000001s)]
*  he's going to hand it to Osama bin Laden who will use it to smuggle nuclear weapons into [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=235.3s)]
*  the United States, same exact narrative. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=240.58s)]
*  Iran is just seconds away from getting a nuclear bomb, we can't allow them to do so, it would [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=244.42000000000002s)]
*  be the end of all of history. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=248.26000000000002s)]
*  If Iran in the world would die, you're going to die if Iran gets a nuclear weapon or is [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=250.82s)]
*  allowed to get close and therefore we have to go to war. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=255.22s)]
*  And it's coming from the same people who have been debunked and exposed as liars over and [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=259.78s)]
*  over because in Washington there's an accountability free zone for people who advocate wars. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=265.46s)]
*  In fact, they get more and more powerful both within media and politics. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=270.46s)]
*  It really doesn't make a difference what happened in the past, they're able to use the same [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=276.58s)]
*  tactics over and over. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=280.18s)]
*  Now the difference is that Donald Trump ran in 2016 on trying to break that bipartisan [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=281.54s)]
*  war policy of endless war. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=289.18s)]
*  He ran not only against the Democratic Party but the Bushini regime, he had to do so, Jeb [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=290.90000000000003s)]
*  Bush was his primary opponent backed by the entire Republican establishment and all of [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=296.14s)]
*  the moneyed interests that support the Bush family and the Republican Party. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=300.66s)]
*  And Trump prided himself and often boasted about the fact that he was one of the first, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=305.18s)]
*  he was the only president in decades not to involve the US in a new war. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=309.26000000000005s)]
*  And by all accounts there is massive pressure now being put on Trump, barely three months [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=314.58000000000004s)]
*  into his presidency to go and bomb just coincidentally what happens to be Israel's primary enemy, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=320.70000000000005s)]
*  the country that Netanyahu has dreamed of inducing the United States into bombing which [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=328.82000000000005s)]
*  is Iran. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=332.90000000000003s)]
*  And by all accounts his posture seems to be he does not want a war with Iran on his legacy, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=336.14s)]
*  that he prefers instead a diplomatic solution that would provide confidence that Iran is [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=342.94s)]
*  not able to obtain a nuclear weapon. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=347.98s)]
*  There was an agreement along those lines negotiated not just by the Obama administration but with [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=352.9s)]
*  the help of many foreign countries, not just in Europe but also Russia, that allowed inspectors [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=358.1s)]
*  in, that by all accounts was and had prevented Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=364.58s)]
*  Trump ran in 2016 on a promise to nullify that deal on the grounds that it was insufficient. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=369.86s)]
*  He pulled out of that deal, all inspectors were gone, that is what has created the crisis [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=374.54s)]
*  that we're now in or at least the ostensible crisis that we're now in where we're told [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=379.76s)]
*  that Iran is again close to a nuclear weapon. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=383.9s)]
*  But at least this time there is serious division and serious debate taking place within the [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=387.34s)]
*  Trump administration on the question of whether or not that is in the United States interest [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=393.26s)]
*  to pursue notwithstanding the extreme amounts of pressure being placed on Trump and his [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=397.65999999999997s)]
*  administration by not just Israel but the legion and army of Israel loyalists who are [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=403.26s)]
*  all over the United States, who are inside the US government and a lot of news outlets [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=409.78s)]
*  have been reporting not just on the two camps within the Trump administration, the one that [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=417.06s)]
*  wants to take the diplomatic route and the one that wants to take the bombing route, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=421.62s)]
*  but also giving a lot of details about who's on which side and my own reporting, my own [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=426.54s)]
*  speaking to people very close to the Trump administration absolutely aligns with several [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=431.34000000000003s)]
*  of these reports including this one from Axios that was published on April 16th with the [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=437.34000000000003s)]
*  headline Trump Teams Iran Divide, Dialogue Versus Detonation to End the Nuclear Threat. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=441.9s)]
*  Quote, one camp unofficially led by Vice President J.D. Vance believes a diplomatic solution [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=449.38s)]
*  is both preferable and possible and that the US should be ready to make compromises in [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=456.02s)]
*  order to make it happen. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=460.34s)]
*  Vance is highly involved in the Iran policy discussions, one of the US officials said. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=462.53999999999996s)]
*  This camp also includes Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff who represented the US in the first [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=467.94s)]
*  round of Iran talks on Saturday as well as Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth. It also [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=472.78s)]
*  gets outside support from MAGA influencer and Trump whisperer Tucker Carlson who I should [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=479.9s)]
*  say has been probably doing more at least consequentially to prevent a military conflict [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=487.59999999999997s)]
*  between the United States and Iran than almost anybody else going back to when he had his [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=494.73999999999995s)]
*  Fox show during the Trump administration and denounced Trump's targeted killing of General [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=498.18s)]
*  Soleimani on the grounds that that was likely to provoke a war with Iran and there was no [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=504.02s)]
*  or at least possibly would provoke a war with Iran and there was no interest in doing that. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=509.58s)]
*  So there is a group of serious influential people who have Trump's ear, J.D. Vance, Steve [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=515.14s)]
*  Witkoff, Tucker Carlson, Pete Hegseth who are strongly in the camp of pursuing a diplomatic [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=520.06s)]
*  resolution. The Axios article goes on, quote, this group is concerned that striking Iran's [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=527.06s)]
*  nuclear facilities would put US soldiers in the region in harm's way when Iran strikes [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=531.6199999999999s)]
*  back. Remember the United States has military bases all throughout the Middle East. I'm [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=537.6199999999999s)]
*  not talking here about sprawling highly fortified military bases, basically small military bases [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=544.6199999999999s)]
*  of a thousand troops here, two thousand troops here in Jordan, in Iraq, in Syria. They're [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=550.5s)]
*  not really highly vulnerable in theory but that have been attacked over the last two [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=556.22s)]
*  years. Service members have died, US service members at military bases attacked by drones, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=559.6600000000001s)]
*  by Iraqi militias, by other forces in the region and all of them will be extremely vulnerable [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=565.1800000000001s)]
*  to counter attack by Iran if the United States or some combination of the US and Israel attack [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=572.34s)]
*  Iran. This is a country three times the size of Iraq with a vastly more sophisticated military [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=576.5s)]
*  than Iraq had. You had a bunch of sheep herders basically in Afghanistan who fought off the [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=586.9s)]

*  why did the Islamic revolution constantly chant death to America? It's probably because [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=874.72s)]

*  I just want to show you a little bit of this. Here's the Guardian from September of 2012, [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=1190.86s)]
*  which is 13 years ago. The headline, Benjamin Netanyahu demands a quote, [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=1197.98s)]
*  red line to stop the Iran nuclear program. Israel's prime minister tells the UN General [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=1202.7s)]

*  Netanyahu marked a line near the top of the bomb. He drew a graphic of a bomb and there was a line [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=1212.3s)]
*  there. Beyond which he said Iran should not be allowed to pass. That line representing 90% of [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=1217.4199999999998s)]

*  that said that was actually completely false. There you see from the Guardian a leaked cable [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=1243.6599999999999s)]
*  shows that Netanyahu's Iran bomb claim was contradicted by Assad. There's that little [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=1248.4599999999998s)]

*  warned the UN in New York that Iran would be able to build nuclear weapons the following year and [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=1285.1s)]
*  called for action to halt that process. But in a secret report shared with South Africa a few weeks [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=1289.74s)]
*  later, Israeli intelligence agency concluded that Iran was, quote, not promoting the act, not [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=1295.5s)]
*  performing the activity necessary to produce weapons. The Assad briefing about Iran's nuclear [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=1300.9399999999998s)]
*  program in 2012 was in stark contrast to the alarmist tone set by Netanyahu, who has long [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=1306.06s)]
*  presented the Iranian nuclear program as an existential threat to Israel and a huge risk to [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=1311.34s)]

*  to close gaps in areas that appear legitimate, such as enrichment reactors, which will reduce [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=1328.78s)]
*  the time required to produce weapons from the time the instruction is actually given. But the [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=1334.62s)]
*  report also states that Iran, quote, does not appear to be ready to enrich uranium to the higher [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=1339.02s)]
*  levels necessary for nuclear weapons. To build a bomb requires enrichment to 90 percent. Assad [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=1343.82s)]
*  estimated that Iran then had about 100 kilograms of material enriched to 20 percent. Iran has always [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=1348.94s)]

*  lied continuously. These are the people who told you Iraq had a nuclear program. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=1364.14s)]
*  That Saddam was in the market for nuclear weapons, that he had biological and chemical weapons, [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=1368.94s)]

*  Who in their right mind would believe them now with the same exact claims but about a different [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=1380.8600000000001s)]
*  Israeli enemy? The Jerusalem Post, February 2013, headlined Netanyahu, Iran is closer than ever to [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=1385.0200000000002s)]
*  a nuclear bomb. Quote, Iran is closer today than ever before to obtaining the necessary [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=1392.38s)]
*  enriched uranium for a nuclear bomb, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Thursday evening. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=1398.38s)]
*  He was reacting to the publication of details of a confidential report by the International [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=1403.18s)]
*  Atomic Energy Agency that Iran had begun installing advanced centrifuges at its main uranium [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=1408.7s)]
*  enrichment plant. Netanyahu termed the report, quote, very grave and said it proved that Iran [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=1413.5800000000002s)]
*  was moving swiftly toward the red line he had set out the UN in September. He said during that [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=1419.1s)]
*  address that Iran must be stopped before it crossed the line, something he said at the time [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=1423.8999999999999s)]
*  could happen as early as the spring. Lots of domestic criticism happened in Israel at the time [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=1429.34s)]
*  from Netanyahu's very exaggerated claims. Here, former Prime Minister Olmert criticizes Netanyahu's [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=1437.58s)]
*  alarmism from Ynet News in April 2013. Olmert, Iranian threat is exaggerated. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=1445.42s)]
*  Former Prime Minister said the Iranian nuclear program is not progressing, calls on Netanyahu [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=1452.22s)]
*  to work intelligently and calmly with U.S. leaders. So over and over this is the sort of thing that [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=1456.6200000000001s)]
*  has happened. Here from the Jerusalem Post, months later, July 2013, Netanyahu, Iran is, quote, [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=1464.3000000000002s)]
*  weeks away from crossing the red line. This is 2013, weeks away. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=1473.66s)]
*  The Times of Israel from January of 2013, Netanyahu, Iran set back only six weeks by nuclear [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=1481.8200000000002s)]
*  deal. Prime Minister said the whole world notes Iran is after nukes. Final agreement will be the [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=1488.8600000000001s)]
*  true test of Tehran's intentions. Here's the Times of Israel and three years later, March of 2015, [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=1493.66s)]
*  when Obama was negotiating the nuclear deal, Netanyahu, the deal will leave Iran, quote, [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=1501.82s)]
*  less than a year away from having a bomb. Quote, the time Iran will need to break out of a nuclear [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=1507.6599999999999s)]
*  program if it signs a deal with world powers in Lausanne, quote, will be reduced to less than a [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=1512.9399999999998s)]
*  year and probably a lot less than that, the Prime Minister warned. Such a deal, whose emerging terms [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=1517.74s)]
*  have been the subject of many reports, would, quote, pave the way to a nuclear weapon. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=1522.7s)]
*  That was the deal that ultimately was signed. Iran did not get a bomb in less than a year [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=1528.14s)]
*  to say nothing of far less than that. Do you see the relentless tsunami of propaganda coming from [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=1533.66s)]
*  Israel, Netanyahu, and its legion of supporters trying to induce the United States to participate [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=1543.34s)]
*  in an attack on Iran based on the sort of propaganda that induced the United States to attack [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=1553.74s)]
*  Saddam Hussein? Look at how many times these warnings have been issued with great urgency. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=1561.1s)]
*  Iran is weeks away, months away. If you do the Iran deal, they're going to get it in a year or far [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=1565.02s)]
*  or less. None of it ever happens. At some point, a rational person has to start doubting these claims. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=1569.4199999999998s)]
*  Here's a news story. Mexico extradites 29 drug traffickers to the US to avoid trade tariffs. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=1575.26s)]
*  We all know how deceptive corporate media can be. They push agendas and censor voices, [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=1585.26s)]
*  make sure you only see one side of the story. That's exactly why I started this show on Rumble, [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=1590.3s)]
*  because I believe in free speech and real conversations and the best pursuit of the [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=1594.22s)]
*  truth possible. And it's also why I partnered with an app and website that believes in those values [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=1598.94s)]
*  Ground News prioritizes free speech over controlling the narrative. For every story, [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=1604.86s)]
*  every news story, you can find all the articles reporting on it worldwide with context, such as [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=1609.98s)]
*  if a news source has any political bias, how credible they are, and if any major corporation [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=1614.86s)]
*  is influencing their reporting. All I have to do is swipe through coverage with tags indicating [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=1619.5s)]
*  if it's coming from liberal or conservative sources or corporations or independent voices. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=1624.94s)]
*  I can decide for myself if Mexico's unprecedented extradition of 29 cartel members to the US really [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=1629.8999999999999s)]
*  is proof that Trump's tariffs are working, like some conservative sources insist, or if it's just [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=1636.3799999999999s)]
*  a routine legal process and one of the cartel members pled not guilty anyway, as many center [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=1642.9399999999998s)]
*  and left sources are insisting. Different sources are saying different things as usual. If I just [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=1647.98s)]
*  read one of these stories, I'd have a completely skewed or incomplete view of reality, but with [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=1653.34s)]
*  Ground News, I can now pull all of them side by side and decide for myself who's actually telling [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=1658.7s)]
*  the truth. Ground News even created a dedicated feed called Blind Spot that exposes stories that [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=1663.98s)]
*  either side of the political spectrum isn't reporting on, making it possible to spot stories [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA9mxUUkwBo&t=1669.5800000000002s)]
