# Israeli Influence Campaigns on U.S. Campuses Investigated with Journalists Lee Fang and Jack Poulson
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [June 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY)
*  Another breaking story of independent reporting, an original reporting, very important reporting [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=0.0s)]
*  that was published today about the extent of the Israeli influence operation machine [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=13.16s)]
*  inside the United States and it was done by two highly accomplished independent journalists. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=19.72s)]
*  Lee Fong is one of them. He was a colleague of mine back at the Intercept and after wisely leaving that outlet [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=26.32s)]
*  before it completely sunk into the sea, he is now doing that work at his own sub stack where he [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=32.52s)]
*  regularly breaks big stories using standard and tireless investigative techniques which is why he [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=39.0s)]
*  is so often on our show because he's constantly breaking those kind of stories through just sheer [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=44.2s)]
*  hard investigative work. His co-author on this story is Jack Paulson who was an independent [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=49.6s)]
*  journalist who focuses on the intersection of technology and the military. He completed his [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=55.04s)]
*  PhD in computational and applied mathematics at UT Austin in 2012 before serving as an assistant [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=60.48s)]
*  professor of computational science and engineering at Georgia Tech and then an assistant professor [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=66.48s)]
*  of mathematics at Stanford University. The duo teamed up to publish a journalistic investigation [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=71.12s)]
*  that was published today in collaboration with The Guardian into the extent of the Israeli influence [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=77.16s)]
*  campaign aimed at the United States. The article there you see on the screen is entitled, quote, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=82.32s)]
*  Israeli documents show expansive covert US influence campaign. Israeli government officials [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=87.83999999999999s)]
*  closely coordinate with advocacy groups shaping congressional and state legislation, social media, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=94.63999999999999s)]
*  and campus discourse. Now this is obviously a topic that we have been covering quite some time. We [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=101.0s)]
*  think it is of the utmost importance that there is a foreign country who is working very hard with [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=107.36s)]
*  a lot of money to not only influence public opinion in the United States but also the laws that the [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=113.16s)]
*  states and our federal legislature enact that have a very direct relationship with that foreign [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=119.24s)]
*  government and we are delighted to welcome both of them to the show. Good evening. It's great to [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=125.24s)]
*  see you guys both. Congratulations on the story and I just want to kind of dive right into these [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=129.72s)]
*  questions because they do have a fair number of them and I guess you guys can decide amongst [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=136.56s)]
*  yourselves who you're going to answer. If you want I can just direct them but let me just ask, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=140.96s)]
*  let me ask each of you actually and Jack you can go first. As I said there's been a lot of reporting [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=146.72s)]
*  recently, over many years as well as recently, about the extent of what the Israelis are doing [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=152.56s)]
*  to influence American politics, the lawmaking process, American public opinion. What is one [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=158.6s)]
*  or two of what you think are the most significant new revelations in the story that you published? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=166.08s)]
*  Yeah so there's a U.S. non-profit called the Institute for the Study of Global Antisemitism [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=172.72000000000003s)]
*  and Policy which is a bit of a mouthful or pronounced is gap typically. It was originally [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=180.32000000000002s)]
*  a center within Yale. It was kind of kicked out in 2011 for not being sufficiently rigorous [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=187.52s)]
*  and what I think hasn't really been paid attention to is that they have publicly claimed credit for [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=195.28s)]
*  the hearings that led to the firings of the several university presidents. For example, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=201.83999999999997s)]
*  in particular claiming credit for the December 5th hearings in front of Congress where Elise [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=208.88s)]
*  Stefanik really grilled Harvard president Claudine Gay and basically we trace out what led to that. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=213.76s)]
*  In particular, there are reports on alleged Qatari influence on U.S. student campus protests [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=222.56s)]
*  and then how that fits into broader kind of formal public-private partnership that's pretty [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=232.16s)]
*  widely reported known as CONSERT or you know it's undergone several different names. It kind of uses [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=239.76s)]
*  all of them interchangeably to this day. Originally it was Kela Schlomo, then it was CONSERT and now [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=247.52s)]
*  it's Voices of Israel and it's really a way for the Israeli government to chip in half the money [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=254.64000000000001s)]
*  and then for philanthropists in the U.S. and around the world to chip in the other half to fund kind [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=261.6s)]
*  of pro-Israeli non-profits to advocate and lobby on behalf of the Israeli government. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=267.04s)]
*  So Lee, if you want to pick out one or two nuggets of the story that you think provides [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=273.36s)]
*  kind of new revelations about the influence campaign by this foreign government inside [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=278.32s)]
*  the United States, please do so. But also let me just add to that the kind of broader perspective [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=283.36s)]
*  of what the significance is of the fact that Israel is doing this. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=289.2s)]
*  Well look, just a few weeks into the Gaza War, there was a discussion in the Knesset, the Israeli [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=293.76s)]
*  Parliament about what to do around all of these students at universities, particularly elite [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=301.76s)]
*  universities where there's a lot of influence in American society that were critical of Israel. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=308.4s)]
*  And there was a government minister Amichai Chikli who said, don't worry, we're going on the offensive [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=314.15999999999997s)]
*  and I'm paraphrasing him, and we're going to do it in the concert way. And he's referencing what [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=321.04s)]
*  Jack was just talking about, this kind of semi-covert organization that's controlled by the Israeli [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=325.52000000000004s)]
*  government that's run these kind of covert PR campaigns in the past. They were set up to be a [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=333.20000000000005s)]
*  quote PR commando unit to control kind of troll armies on social media to lobby in the U.S. to [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=338.8s)]
*  help pass laws in the U.S. They were partially responsible for the passage of anti-BDS laws [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=347.44s)]
*  over the last few years and in state capitals around the country. Well, after October 7th, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=357.6s)]
*  there was a relaunch of this unit and it's partnering with a number of groups. Some of [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=363.6s)]
*  its partners are doing outreach to Black Democrats. They have a partner organization in the U.S. that's [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=369.2s)]
*  mobilizing support from lawmakers from the African-American community. Many of their former [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=376.32s)]
*  leaders are working with an Israeli NGO, but very active in the U.S., that's helping Metta, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=382.56s)]
*  that's Facebook and WhatsApp and Instagram, as well as TikTok, censor media. They're using the same [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=391.68s)]
*  rubric that many other NGOs use, Media Matters and ADL and others, saying that we're just here to [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=399.84000000000003s)]
*  provide assistance in stopping misinformation, disinformation, hate speech. But they're very [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=408.08s)]
*  clearly working with the Israeli government and censoring it and content moderating speech that's [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=412.88s)]
*  critical of Israel. In addition to all of that, just as this same entity that worked to pass [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=420.32s)]
*  anti-BDS laws in the past, and that's been well documented, what we're documented here that's [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=426.88s)]
*  completely new is that they are openly discussing their strategy to pass laws like the IHRA, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=432.0s)]
*  International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, definition of anti-Semitism and to basically [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=440.96s)]
*  encode that into U.S. law, state law, federal law. We saw the passage of the bill in the House last [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=446.4s)]
*  month on education policy, but there are similar laws around the country that basically say that [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=452.0s)]
*  a form of illegal discrimination, of anti-Semitism, is certain forms of harsh criticism. It's saying [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=460.0s)]
*  terms like, or slogans like, Israel is a racist country. That can be viewed as a hate crime or [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=467.84s)]
*  as an illegal form of discrimination. That's a big part of their agenda, redefining the term [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=476.56s)]
*  anti-Semitism to stifle certain criticisms of Israel. We were able to obtain exclusive documents [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=483.6s)]
*  showing that even the Israeli Foreign Ministry has been in touch with these local state lawmakers in [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=492.32s)]
*  Florida to pass this type of legislation. They're openly talking about it in the Knesset. They're [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=498.40000000000003s)]
*  saying this is their top priority. They're very clear in discussing their strategy. We looked at [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=503.84000000000003s)]
*  transcripts. We looked at various business filings, public documents, government contracts. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=510.56s)]
*  We really blend together a lot of sources to tell the story. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=516.4s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. I really encourage people to read it on their own. We're not going to be [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=519.28s)]
*  able to do every part of it justice. Here tonight, I want to highlight the important parts and then [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=522.08s)]
*  draw out the implications. I just want to add one thing, which is the very first story that I ever [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=526.72s)]
*  reported in my entire life on the question of big tech censorship at the behest of governments [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=531.6s)]
*  was at the end of 2015, maybe the beginning of 2016, when there was a document that was released [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=537.76s)]
*  showing that the Israeli government had an ongoing relationship with the top leadership of Facebook [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=544.5600000000001s)]
*  where they were able to submit lists of Facebook pages that the Israeli government alleged were [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=551.76s)]
*  promoting terrorism or were in some way inciting hatred toward Israel. That basically means any [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=558.0s)]
*  page run by Palestinians that were critical of Israel. In something like 98% of the cases, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=563.84s)]
*  Facebook was taking these requests and approving them and banning whatever accounts the Israelis [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=569.44s)]
*  indicated. Of course, this has been going on since then where they've been meeting, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=576.72s)]
*  Israel has with big tech companies and saying, we demand that you remove [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=581.2s)]
*  disinformation. One of the things they listed as disinformation was the idea that the Israeli [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=585.6s)]
*  military actually killed some of their own citizens on October 7th, something that is now proven [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=590.5600000000001s)]
*  beyond any shadow of a doubt is true. The Israeli government even acknowledges that. They're trying [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=595.52s)]
*  to prevent, and again, not in Israel, but in the United States, the ability for Americans to express [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=599.6800000000001s)]
*  certain views. Yet another example where the parts of the right have been indignant about this [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=605.52s)]
*  government big tech collaboration to censor. This is one of those areas where magically, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=612.7199999999999s)]
*  the pro-Israel part of the right seems to have no problem. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=619.68s)]
*  Jack, let me ask you, and actually I want to hear your view on this as well. There's been this [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=623.4399999999999s)]
*  obsession on the part of certain segments of the American punditry with what's going on in American [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=630.4799999999999s)]
*  colleges for quite some time. There's always been this kind of strange, you could even say creepy [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=637.28s)]
*  dynamic where 45-year-old writers from the New Republic, New York Magazine and those kind of [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=643.6s)]
*  places are just constantly focused on what 19 and 20-year-olds are doing and writing articles [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=651.68s)]
*  about that on college campuses. One of the arguments you could make is that, well, the reason [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=656.8s)]
*  you have to focus on that is because these people and those trends become, in the future, the leaders [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=662.0799999999999s)]
*  are shaping our culture. But one of the things I've started to believe over the last 18 months to [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=666.72s)]
*  24 months, a lot of those pundits who have been focused on colleges happen to be among the most [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=672.64s)]
*  vocal supporters of the Israeli government in all of US media. They justify this focus on colleges [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=679.6s)]
*  under an anti-woke banner, like people like Barry Weiss and Ben Shapiro, that whole crowd. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=687.44s)]
*  And at the same time, there have been strategy documents from the Israeli government saying [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=693.5999999999999s)]
*  the most important thing that we need to do is focus on American college campuses and prevent [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=698.0799999999999s)]
*  the growth of anti-Israel sentiment on American college campuses because that is such a threat to [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=704.48s)]
*  our national interest. What have you been able to discover in this new reporting about the [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=711.52s)]
*  the priority that the Israeli government has been giving to try and control or influence [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=716.32s)]
*  American citizens or American college campuses? [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=723.84s)]
*  I would say that that's actually been pretty consistent since the start of [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=729.44s)]
*  Concert or Kelosh Lomo, as it was known before. I think this was actually pretty well, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=735.12s)]
*  the focus on campuses was pretty well documented by some undercover footage [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=741.44s)]
*  collected by an Al Jazeera journalist that was actually lobbied not to be formally released in [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=745.6s)]
*  the United States, but eventually was through the electronic intifada. And the wording that was used [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=752.24s)]
*  was really that, hey, every politician at some point was in college. And so if you really want [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=759.6s)]
*  to impact future leaders, you should do this. In terms of the methodology for how that's being done, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=766.64s)]
*  I think the focus has really been on pushing for reports in a sort of pseudo academic way [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=775.52s)]
*  that Qatar is secretly bankrolling in behind all of the protests and then to push through closed [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=785.28s)]
*  door congressional meetings for investigations into the financing of these student groups. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=793.68s)]
*  One of the lines in this article was linking to a May, I believe, May 7th meeting between the head [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=800.48s)]
*  of this nonprofit, ISGAP, with the House Oversight Committee. And then the next week, there's a letter [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=809.8399999999999s)]
*  submitted to Janet Yellen demanding an investigation into these students. And then ISGAP claims credit. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=816.0799999999999s)]
*  And so to some degree, I would say lawfare is a central component of this and kind of mapping out [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=823.92s)]
*  how that lawfare works as part of the interest. Lee, I wanted to ask you about that as well. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=828.8s)]
*  The kind of obsession of the Israeli government and a lot of pro-Israel pundits inside the United [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=834.88s)]
*  States with what's going on on campus. And you have this paragraph in your article that relates [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=841.5999999999999s)]
*  to this because I think a lot of the, and I'm going to read it in a second, but I think a lot of the [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=849.8399999999999s)]
*  concern on the Israeli government is that the boycott, divestment, and sanctions activism that [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=853.36s)]
*  brought down or helped bring down the apartheid government in South Africa in the 1980s [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=860.3199999999999s)]
*  might also do the same to the Israeli government or to the Israeli occupation. And a lot of that [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=864.88s)]
*  activism came in 1980s from colleges and now is coming again from colleges as we've seen with the [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=869.04s)]
*  protests against the Israeli war in Gaza. So one of the things that I've been most disturbed by are [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=874.16s)]
*  the enactment of these laws in 24 American states that basically require as a condition for having [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=880.88s)]
*  contract work with the state that you sign a pledge that you don't believe in and will not [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=888.08s)]
*  participate in any boycott of the state of Israel. You can boycott any other country you want. You [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=891.68s)]
*  can boycott American states, just not the Israeli government. You have to sign a pledge about this [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=897.4399999999999s)]
*  foreign government in order to get a job inside the United States with a state. And here's the [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=903.6s)]
*  paragraph that you have that I'm interested in. You said quote, the concert remark referred to [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=908.88s)]
*  a sprawling relaunch of a controversial Israeli government program, initially known as [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=914.72s)]
*  Kaish Slomo, designed to carry out what Israelis called quote, mass consciousness activities [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=920.88s)]
*  targeted largely at the U.S. and Europe. Concert, now known as the voices of Israel, [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=927.36s)]
*  previously worked with groups spearheading a campaign to pass so-called quote, anti-BDS state [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=933.44s)]
*  laws that penalize Americans for engaging in boycotts or other non-violent protests of Israel. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=939.6800000000001s)]
*  You know, it was bad enough when I thought that, you know, like Israel obsessed politicians in the [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=948.24s)]
*  Democratic Party or evangelical obsessed politicians, evangelical politicians obsessed with Israel in the [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=953.2800000000001s)]
*  Republican Party were passing these kind of assaults on our free speech rights inside the United States, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=958.24s)]
*  but it turns out that the Israeli government is playing a major role in that. What is that role? [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=963.2s)]
*  Well, historically and now what's continued on to today with the post-October 7th campaign, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=970.08s)]
*  there's this kind of duality where the Ministry of Diaspora Affairs and previously the Ministry [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=977.6800000000001s)]
*  of Strategic Affairs in Israel, they set up these public benefit corporations that are used to funnel [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=982.88s)]
*  Israeli and some private money to certain organizations to carry out these legislative [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=990.32s)]
*  goals. So previously it was a focus on these anti-BDS laws, very successful in that. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=996.72s)]
*  And now it's the IHRA. But, you know, just in terms of reporting this story, it's fascinating [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1005.2s)]
*  because, you know, we were going into the minutia of the Knesset hearings where government ministers [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1011.76s)]
*  experts openly, you know, they have public broadcasts and transcripts to their credit [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1020.0s)]
*  discussing strategy of what they're doing. And, you know, they're saying that we really need to [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1026.0s)]
*  focus on these elite colleges. These elite colleges, as Jack said, will become the leaders [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1030.0s)]
*  of tomorrow, but also they are kind of the opinion setters, more mid-tier lower colleges, [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1034.72s)]
*  they mimic what the elite colleges do. It influences the culture. So they are laser focused [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1040.3200000000002s)]
*  on shaping what happens on these college campuses. So in addition to what I mentioned earlier, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1045.68s)]
*  they're providing money through a sister kind of public benefit corporation called Mosaic United [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1050.64s)]
*  that funds major Jewish and pro-Israel student groups. That's Hillel, that's Chabad on campus, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1057.3600000000001s)]
*  and they're asking them to provide intelligence reports essentially, monitoring the [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1065.1200000000001s)]
*  Palestinian student groups, lobbying the university administrators to kick out certain [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1069.44s)]
*  pro-Palestinian or groups that are critical of Israel. They're taking kind of a really expansive [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1075.28s)]
*  role in influencing these campuses. And just to back up a little bit, you know, in terms of how [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1083.68s)]
*  they pass these laws, we've seen from really important investigative reporting from Israeli [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1087.92s)]
*  journalists in the past, looking into these very similar programs, there was money sent from the [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1094.0s)]
*  Israeli government to certain Christian Zionist groups in America, the Israeli Allies Foundation, [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1099.92s)]
*  which is, you know, supported by Mike Pence and many Republican lawmakers, Christians United for [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1105.84s)]
*  Israel, that's Pastor John Hagee, who's close to Ted Cruz and Nikki Haley. These groups were supporting [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1111.44s)]
*  the push for the anti-BDS laws. They lobby Congress, they lobby the state legislatures every day. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1118.48s)]
*  They're lobbying again for this same round of laws that attempt to curtail speech that's [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1123.44s)]
*  critical of Israel. So it's a lot of the same playbook that was documented five or six years [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1130.8s)]
*  ago with the BDS campaign. We've just compiled the documents and other forms of evidence to [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1135.3600000000001s)]
*  show that it's been relaunched. There's been a new injection of money and a new push that's again [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1141.1200000000001s)]
*  focused in Congress, focused on these college campuses. Yeah, there was this article in The [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1146.64s)]
*  Atlantic from a couple months ago by Theo Baker, who sort of like the embodiment of a nepo-baby in [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1151.76s)]
*  journalism. His father, I think they identify as non-binary with the pronouns they, them, so let [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1157.28s)]
*  me try and respect that. Their father is Peter Baker, who's the New York Times Chief Washington [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1164.56s)]
*  Bureau correspondent, and their mother is Susan Glasser, who has worked with The New Yorker and [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1172.24s)]
*  Politico and of course lo and behold they get the opportunity that almost no other 20-year-old gets [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1177.28s)]
*  to write this major article for The Atlantic edited by Jeffrey Goldberg in which Theo Baker [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1182.8799999999999s)]
*  describes being a student at Stanford. He kind of tattles on all the different activists, anti-Israel [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1189.92s)]
*  activists, things they've said, things they've done. It's exactly this kind of like student to [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1195.44s)]
*  student surveillance and creating dossiers of people who are critical of this foreign country [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1200.6399999999999s)]
*  on American campuses. Now Jack, let me ask you because Lee mentioned Hillel and you know when I [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1206.48s)]
*  was in college Hillel was you know a very influential group. It's generally a group of [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1212.48s)]
*  Jewish students whose main cause is Israel and Lee was describing the part of your reporting in this [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1217.44s)]
*  article that linked the Israeli government and its funding to Hillel and the encouragement of Hillel [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1224.48s)]
*  to kind of be the arm of the Israeli government on American college campuses. One of the things, [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1229.76s)]
*  one of the people you mentioned was someone named Adam Lehman who's the chairman of Hillel [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1234.56s)]
*  and this visit that he made to the Knesset, the Israeli legislature, in February of 2024 where he [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1239.04s)]
*  eventually reported to them or boasted of the kind of surveillance activities in which they're engaged [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1244.96s)]
*  on behalf in the United States on behalf of Israel. Let's show this part of this speech that he gave [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1252.48s)]
*  to the Knesset. The great American Jewish community. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1257.6799999999998s)]
*  I'd like to give Adam Lehman. Thank you very much. Hillel International. Yes from Hillel [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1263.2s)]
*  International. Thank you Chairman Ford. Thank you to the other esteemed members of the committee. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1269.1200000000001s)]
*  We're honored to be here. I want to talk about what's happening on college campuses. Isolated [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1276.0s)]
*  incident from more of an epidemic and this truly has become that epidemic. What are we doing about [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1281.28s)]
*  it? Very importantly we have great partners in Israel and I want to give credit to the Jewish [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1287.68s)]
*  Agency for Israel through our partnership of having 80 Shachim on our campuses. That's been [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1292.8s)]
*  fundamental. Our Mosaic United partnership supported through the Ministry of Diaspora Affairs [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1298.08s)]
*  has been very important as well. Our fighting back is legal and we cannot fall short of using [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1303.36s)]
*  every legal channel available. We have been as Harriet pointed out lobbying aggressively with [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1311.12s)]
*  the United States government to make sure that they are enforcing Title VI of the Civil Rights [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1316.32s)]
*  Act. That is making an enormous difference. We have more than 60 investigations now publicly [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1321.76s)]
*  announced and that matters. We have something called the Campus Anti-Semitism Legal Line which [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1328.0s)]
*  is a partnership with the Brandeis Center and ADL where we've had more than 400 students be able to [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1334.24s)]
*  report the issues that they have encountered and receive direct legal advice so they can bring action. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1339.68s)]
*  We are working with university administrators to get them to change policies to protect Jewish [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1346.48s)]
*  students and to make sure that Israel is not demonized on campus and that Jewish students [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1352.64s)]
*  can be safely Jewish and Zionist at the same time. We have 75 universities now who are part of what [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1357.76s)]
*  we call the Campus Climate Initiative doing that work and finally we are educating. We are an [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1364.96s)]
*  educational institution working in educational environments and we need to continue to break [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1370.0s)]
*  through the horrible propaganda which demonizes Israel. We have something right now, a teach-in [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1377.52s)]
*  tour that's going to 200 campuses bringing Israel educators including from Israel as well as from [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1384.0s)]
*  North America doing that work. I'll close just by pointing out a few signs of hope. Of course [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1390.4s)]
*  we have to take seriously the issue. Okay so Jack, I mean someone might hear that and say [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1397.44s)]
*  I don't know that seems pretty benign to me. You have a chairman of a group Hillel International [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1403.92s)]
*  that operates on American college campuses and he went to Israel to kind of report on their [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1411.3600000000001s)]
*  successes in promoting the cause of Israel on American campuses. Why is this something that [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1416.24s)]
*  ought to be of concern to us? Well right after you cut off clip is where Wayman claims credit for [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1421.68s)]
*  MIT's president disbanding their chapter of what he refers to as SJP or Students for Justice in [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1431.1200000000001s)]
*  Palestine. Let me interrupt you because I did accidentally do that. Let's just hear him saying [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1440.0800000000002s)]
*  that part quickly and then I'll go I want to go back to you. But we are going to prevail on campus [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1444.5600000000002s)]
*  just like Israel will prevail in its war here. We are changing administrations. Just last week [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1450.4s)]
*  MIT, the same president who was lambasted in front of Congress, took the step of fully suspending [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1457.1200000000001s)]
*  her Students for Justice in Palestine chapter for crossing lines and for creating an unwelcome [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1465.76s)]
*  environment for Jewish students. We've had now dozens of administrations change policy and this [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1472.0s)]
*  is going to make a difference on campus today. And finally we need to invest in... All right so [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1479.04s)]
*  there are a lot of seeming successes they've had that he's reporting to the state of Israel about [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1486.8799999999999s)]
*  their ability to influence American college campuses but when I interrupted you I was asking [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1493.6s)]
*  you what's wrong with that? Why should people be concerned about that? These are fundamentally [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1497.84s)]
*  non-profits in the United States being funded by and working hand in glove with the Israeli [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1504.6399999999999s)]
*  government to shut down the free speech of college students. I would say that's kind of the bottom [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1510.0s)]
*  line but in terms of the mechanism obviously the redefinition of anti-Semitism has if you listen to [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1515.04s)]
*  the words of Natan Sharansky who's a central figure in our reporting who's the former minister of [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1522.8s)]
*  diaspora affairs circa 2003 to 2006 very famous for being arrested by the Soviet Union [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1530.64s)]
*  allegedly for working with the CIA and if you listen to his actual history of the definition of [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1537.3600000000001s)]
*  IHRA it's actually the entire purpose was to oppose a call at the UN in 2001 right before [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1543.68s)]
*  9-11 in fact that referred to Israel as an apartheid state and then over time it ramped up [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1551.92s)]
*  specifically to oppose BDS and so I would say the entire purpose of this redefinition is to shut [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1557.36s)]
*  down the free speech of these college students and so yeah. All right Lee just to wrap this up [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1564.32s)]
*  because we do have a couple more updates on the Julian Assange story that we want to [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1572.16s)]
*  cover before we sign off for the night and again I really encourage people to go and look at your [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1576.72s)]
*  article I believe it's on the Guardian site but also on your substack where people should [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1583.44s)]
*  I hope would go and read it would support the work that you're doing there because this is the kind [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1589.3600000000001s)]
*  of work you do regularly but and we'll put the link in the notes to the show as well but I just [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1593.2s)]
*  wanted to raise this issue which is the question of Apex influence inside the United States we did [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1601.0400000000002s)]
*  a show on that last night in or the other night in in terms of their attempt to remove Jamal [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1607.44s)]
*  Bowman from Congress for his refusal to be sufficiently supportive of Israel and the kind [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1612.16s)]
*  of singular power they have to do things like that inside the United States there's always been this [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1616.96s)]
*  question that you know we do have laws in place that require groups that are advocating for the [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1622.5600000000002s)]
*  interest of a foreign country and getting financing in order to do that that they have to basically [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1628.88s)]
*  register as a foreign as an agent of a foreign country people have gone to prison for failing [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1634.0s)]
*  to do so that was one of the laws called fair fair that they used to try and prosecute some of [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1639.2s)]
*  Trump's associates claiming that they were acting on behalf of foreign governments and didn't [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1644.32s)]
*  disclose it and the argument has always been from APAC well we don't have to register as agents of [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1648.16s)]
*  a foreign country because we're not agents of Israel we're American citizens who just happen [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1656.0s)]
*  to believe that it is in the interest of our country the United States and our fellow citizens [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1660.88s)]
*  to do everything possible to support Israel to pay for its military to finance all of its wars to [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1666.72s)]
*  isolate ourselves on the world stage in order to protect Israel what is your reporting what kind [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1672.4s)]
*  of light does it shed on that question not necessarily with response with regard to APAC but [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1679.92s)]
*  the this entire universe of pro-Israel organizations operating in the United States based on the claim [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1684.56s)]
*  that they're operating independently of and not as agents of the Israeli government [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1692.08s)]
*  you know just before I answer that I want to add one point to your previous question to Jack [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1696.8s)]
*  no you have to just answer that yeah I don't want not interested in your separate point [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1701.2s)]
*  no I'm just kidding go ahead no but for the Hillel statement you know protecting Jewish [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1704.48s)]
*  safety and fighting anti-Semitism on campus you know I don't see any problems with that that's [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1711.1200000000001s)]
*  great that's an important cause but you see what he does there with the strategic guidance of the [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1716.96s)]
*  strategic guidance of the Ministry of Diaspora Affairs with funding from the Israeli government [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1722.56s)]
*  he's saying that we're also pushing back on student groups that are criticizing Israel [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1727.04s)]
*  and we're fighting to say you know that that that we're fighting to protect Israel from criticism [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1731.9199999999998s)]
*  on college campuses that's an entirely different story and conflating the two is very dangerous [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1738.3999999999999s)]
*  and in terms of this question about foreign lobbying and foreign registration you know since [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1743.6s)]
*  the 1930s we've had the Foreign Agent Registration Act FARA that's to you know just require lobbyists [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1749.2s)]
*  who are representing foreign governments to do some basic registration to disclose their activities [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1756.8s)]
*  there's a really fascinating history in this we don't have time to get into around APAC and many [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1762.88s)]
*  of these pro-Israel groups and and kind of dodging these regulations for decades but what's incredible [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1767.3600000000001s)]
*  here is that you know we have documented evidence of groups that are heavily funded by the Israeli [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1773.2s)]
*  government at least historically and likely today that are now staffed even some of them [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1778.4s)]
*  by Israeli intelligence officers or former intelligence officers who are taking credit [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1783.68s)]
*  for lobbying and enacting law and lobbying congress to help encourage congressional [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1788.0800000000002s)]
*  investigations that are meeting with lawmakers every day and none of these groups that we've [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1794.5600000000002s)]
*  discussed today have registered under FARA and FARA is not just about money you know you can you [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1799.6000000000001s)]
*  don't have to receive a dime from a foreign government if you're taking a coordinated action [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1805.6s)]
*  to shape public policy and public opinion on behalf of foreign government you still have to [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1811.6799999999998s)]
*  register so these groups that have taken money that's a trigger they should register but there [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1817.28s)]
*  but for for the ones that are openly coordinating you know we've we've we've listed all these [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1821.76s)]
*  Knesset hearings and other examples of of clear coordination in addition to the money none of them [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1826.56s)]
*  have registered you know it just seems like a very lopsided enforcement of the law especially [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1832.88s)]
*  if you look at since 2016 after the Russian meddling kind of scandal controversy in that [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1837.44s)]
*  presidential election we've had a huge increase in enforcement of FARA FARA which is enforced by the [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1844.88s)]
*  department of justice there have been many enforcement cases many civil and criminal actions [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1850.8000000000002s)]
*  uh but nothing in terms of pro-israel advocacy groups where there's documented ties to the [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1857.68s)]
*  Israeli government yeah it's amazing there's so much obsession of course with Russia's alleged [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1862.56s)]
*  interference in our sacred democracy and influence campaigns people claim they're concerned about [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1868.0s)]
*  that when it comes to governments like Qatar and Qatari money and yet this is so far beyond [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1873.6s)]
*  any of that especially given the relationship between the United States and Israel that it's [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1879.84s)]
*  almost impossible to feign concern for those other involvements of foreign governments in [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1884.16s)]
*  our political affairs while being indifferent to this massive long-standing multi-pronged campaign [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1890.3200000000002s)]
*  of the Israeli government not only to manipulate our discourse but to facilitate all kinds of [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1896.96s)]
*  changes to our colleges to our laws to our free speech rights it's it's really quite extraordinary [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz1Zsf26XY&t=1901.3600000000001s)]
