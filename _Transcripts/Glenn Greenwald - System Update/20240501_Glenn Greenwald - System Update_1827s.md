# Dr. Jill Stein on Israel's Crimes; PLUS: WashU Protest Arrest
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [May 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE)
*  Dr. Jill Stein is one of the best-known independent politicians in the United States. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=0.0s)]
*  She has twice run for president as a Green Party candidate both in 2012 and 2016 and [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=11.64s)]
*  is doing so again this year. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  She is a medical doctor having graduated from Harvard University and then she practiced [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=18.98s)]
*  internal medicine for the next 25 years. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=23.2s)]
*  Although Democrats who can never accept responsibility for their own losses blame her for the loss [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=26.6s)]
*  of Hillary Clinton in 2016 and frequently call her all kinds of names including being [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=32.64s)]
*  a Russian asset, we consider her to be one of the most important and interesting independent [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=37.84s)]
*  voices in this country especially when she is a presidential candidate as she is this [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=42.52s)]
*  year and we are delighted to welcome her to the show. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=47.040000000000006s)]
*  Dr. Stein, good evening. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=49.96s)]
*  It's great to see you. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=51.24s)]
*  Thanks for coming on. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=52.24s)]
*  Great, Glenn. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=53.24s)]
*  It's really wonderful to be with you. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=54.24s)]
*  Great honor. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=56.88s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=57.88s)]
*  So let's begin with the somewhat dramatic episode that happened to you this week. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=58.88s)]
*  You were exercising your first amendment rights as an American citizen by participating in [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=64.08s)]
*  a protest on Washington University's campus in St. Louis and along with dozens of students [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=68.2s)]
*  who were participating in that protest as well against the Israeli war in Gaza and US [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=74.92s)]
*  support for it, you ended up being arrested. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=78.2s)]
*  Why did you end up getting arrested? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=81.1s)]
*  What happened there? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=82.44s)]
*  I had been at a campaign event at a public library just a couple blocks away. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=85.88s)]
*  There were some wonderful students there from the encampment and just speaking in a really [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=89.8s)]
*  eloquent way about what they were doing and on the way out from the library another student [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=95.48s)]
*  from the university asked me to stop by and I said of course, we so support what the students [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=103.16s)]
*  are doing who are really the moral fiber of America at the moment. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=108.92s)]
*  When we arrived at the campus, the students who were at the encampment then asked us would [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=114.24000000000001s)]
*  we please go and try to deescalate the situation with the administration. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=119.0s)]
*  So myself and two of the aldermen for St. Louis who were also there to support the encampment [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=126.32000000000001s)]
*  went over to try to negotiate. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=132.04000000000002s)]
*  It wasn't really successful, I will say. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=134.16s)]
*  After that the students asked me to join the circle around the encampment to defend their [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=138.52s)]
*  constitutional rights to free speech and the right to protest on a subject of absolutely [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=144.12s)]
*  critical importance to the moral conscience of the nation and our values and so on. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=150.16s)]
*  So as we were standing there, basically the police assaulted us with bicycles as a weapon. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=156.28s)]
*  They did appear to specifically single me out and say to get her and you can see in [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=163.92000000000002s)]
*  the footage that they were basically pushing me and my campaign colleagues around me and [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=169.56s)]
*  the students, they were pushing us over and were about to flip me backwards onto my head [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=178.24s)]
*  and one of the cops at that point bent down and picked up one of my feet in an effort [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=185.4s)]
*  to come in for the final blow and jerk me into a backflip basically onto the ground [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=190.28s)]
*  and I, in the effort to recover my balance, I wiggled out of his grip and then he informed [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=196.6s)]
*  me that I had just assaulted him. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=202.51999999999998s)]
*  Apparently my foot may have made contact with him as he was trying to assault me. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=204.83999999999997s)]
*  My foot made contact and he told me that I was assaulting him and that I would be so [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=211.44s)]
*  charged they eventually toppled me and all of us over, cuffed us face down on the ground [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=215.95999999999998s)]
*  and then walked us over to the paddy wagon. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=223.16s)]
*  We were processed and there were about 100 of us actually. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=226.16s)]
*  Everyone eventually at the encampment wound up at the jail. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=229.44s)]
*  We were processed which went on for like five hours and at the end of that time I was then [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=233.48s)]
*  separated from the group because they hadn't said anything about this assault charge. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=239.56s)]
*  I was then separated and I was told to go in a different direction and there was one [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=245.12s)]
*  other person there who was a professor also in his 60s, I'm in my 70s, he was in his 60s, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=249.44000000000003s)]
*  not a particularly vigorous man. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=256.52000000000004s)]
*  There's footage of his assault as well where he was basically a number of officers just [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=259.96000000000004s)]
*  lunged at him. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=265.52000000000004s)]
*  He was just taking photographs. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=266.52000000000004s)]
*  He wasn't even part of the circle around the encampment. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=267.52000000000004s)]
*  He was just a bystander documenting what was going on and they assaulted him, knocked [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=271.56s)]
*  him down on the ground, cuffed him and then face down dragged him by his feet and he was [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=276.8s)]
*  quite injured and beaten up. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=281.64s)]
*  The two of us were the ones that were being booked I guess for assault charges although [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=283.96s)]
*  it's hard to say because it's not on my yellow slip but we were separated. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=289.04s)]
*  We had our mug shots and our fingerprints and urine sample, medical admission. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=292.76s)]
*  It looked like we were being admitted to the jail and then when all that processing [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=298.76s)]
*  was done they said okay now go out that door and that door was an exit so sure enough we [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=303.56s)]
*  were being turned loose. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=307.52s)]
*  Paper doesn't say anything about assault charges but it does appear as though I'm going to [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=308.92s)]
*  be charged with assault for having been assaulted with a bicycle by these riot police who were [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=313.36s)]
*  creating a riot. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=320.52s)]
*  Well I've long said that I consider you to be a very physically imposing and intimidating [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=322.32s)]
*  especially when it comes to confronting armed agents of the state like these police officers [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=326.72s)]
*  so I'm sure they were quite petrified for their safety. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=330.92s)]
*  Let me ask you of the major candidates meaning the people who are recognizable, the people [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=335.48s)]
*  who have a demonstrated ability to run a serious campaign, you are the only Jewish candidate [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=341.28000000000003s)]
*  of the presidential candidates in the 2024 race. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=348.12s)]
*  I know that you're familiar with what is being said about what's happening at these protests [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=351.52s)]
*  and these encampments namely that it's driven by bigotry and hate speech and extreme violence [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=356.28s)]
*  toward an attempt to intimidate Jews and Jews who are on campus. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=361.36s)]
*  Did you see any of that there as a well-known Jewish political figure yourself? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=366.03999999999996s)]
*  To the contrary I'm constantly hearing expressions of community, love and appreciation especially [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=372.96s)]
*  for being a Jewish voice and you know Jewish voices are certainly in the leadership now [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=380.52s)]
*  of these encampments, of these protests, of the demand to end the genocide in Gaza committed [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=385.96000000000004s)]
*  by the apartheid state of Israel. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=391.8s)]
*  I don't hear or see any anti-Jewish sentiment. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=393.96000000000004s)]
*  I hear lots of really pro-Jewish support and gratitude for what I consider to be a basic [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=397.48s)]
*  Jewish value which is that genocide is unacceptable. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=403.52000000000004s)]
*  That was certainly what I was taught growing up within the Jewish community outside of [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=406.66s)]
*  Chicago after the Holocaust. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=411.48s)]
*  I was growing up shortly after the Holocaust. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=413.24s)]
*  My parents were the children of refugees from pogroms in Eastern Europe. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=416.48s)]
*  My grandfather's name was Israel. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=424.72s)]
*  We were very mindful that genocide is really kind of an existential crisis really. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=427.12s)]
*  It's a crisis of civilization and to people growing up in the wake of the Holocaust it [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=436.52s)]
*  was really difficult to come to terms with and one of the ways that our community came [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=442.44s)]
*  to terms with it was by resolving that it would never happen again, not to anybody, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=445.11999999999995s)]
*  didn't matter who, but that genocide is the responsibility not only of the perpetrators [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=449.32s)]
*  but also of the bystanders. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=454.44s)]
*  I just grew up with that in my bones and there was no way that I could stand by. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=456.79999999999995s)]
*  I feel like I have felt so much gratitude from the Muslim community in particular and [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=463.17999999999995s)]
*  students who are up in arms about this. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=470.48s)]
*  I feel so much gratitude from them. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=472.64000000000004s)]
*  To me the problem is that the Zionist community is trying to hide behind Judaism and Zionism [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=475.52000000000004s)]
*  is not Judaism and to say that being against genocide is anti-Semitic is the biggest anti-Semitic [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=484.36s)]
*  slur of all because that essentially says that it's okay with Jews for genocide to [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=493.20000000000005s)]
*  happen. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=498.12s)]
*  If you look at things like the Nuremberg trials and the principles that were established [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=499.76s)]
*  after World War II they were very much not about the idea that one particular group is [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=504.28000000000003s)]
*  particularly vulnerable to these kind of evil acts. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=509.2s)]
*  It was about the nature of humanity being such that any nation, any group of people [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=512.2s)]
*  at any time could perpetrate atrocities of this kind and it was our responsibility to [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=517.28s)]
*  enforce these principles universally against any group including they said the nations [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=522.44s)]
*  that were present and acting as the perpetrators of justice at the Nuremberg trials. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=527.38s)]
*  We do have some video of your arrest that I just want to quickly show so that people [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=532.5s)]
*  can see it with their own eyes what you've described. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=537.54s)]
*  Let's go ahead and put that up. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=539.82s)]
*  Hold the line now! [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=541.2600000000001s)]
*  Hold the line! [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=543.2600000000001s)]
*  Hold the line now! [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=545.2600000000001s)]
*  Hold the line! [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=547.2600000000001s)]
*  Hold the line! [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=549.2600000000001s)]
*  Hold the line now! [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=551.2600000000001s)]
*  Hold the line! [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=553.2600000000001s)]
*  So for people who aren't watching you can see there the bicycle being held by the police [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=555.2600000000001s)]
*  officers and Dr. Stein standing with students being pushed back with that bicycle. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=559.7s)]
*  It definitely looks to me like the police officers are very much in physical control [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=564.94s)]
*  of the situation. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=569.54s)]
*  The idea that they're being endangered or assaulted seems to be quite visibly false. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=570.54s)]
*  But yeah, that definitely illustrates more or less exactly what you were describing. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=576.8199999999999s)]
*  Alright, let me ask you, this is not a new thing for you. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=582.06s)]
*  You have been a long time critic of the treatment by the Israelis of the Palestinians. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=586.54s)]
*  It is not new that the Israelis are bombing Gaza. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=592.62s)]
*  They have done so many, many times over the past several decades. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=594.8199999999999s)]
*  When they were occupying it, now when they're blockading it. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=598.54s)]
*  On the scope of things that you have seen, moral atrocities and war and the like, both [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=601.14s)]
*  in terms of the Israeli treatment of the Palestinians and then more broadly modern day war in the [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=607.34s)]
*  21st century, where do you rank the current destruction of Gaza by the Israelis on that [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=612.9s)]
*  list? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=617.7s)]
*  You know, I think it is the most horrifying thing that we have witnessed. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=618.7s)]
*  This is a genocide that's being live streamed. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=624.1800000000001s)]
*  This is, you know, people, I feel like as a medical doctor, I feel like I am on a death [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=626.9399999999999s)]
*  watch right now for two million people. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=631.78s)]
*  And this is extremely comfortable. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=633.78s)]
*  You know, extremely uncomfortable. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=635.18s)]
*  It's actually intolerable. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=637.38s)]
*  I don't think I could stand to witness this without fighting it with every fiber of my [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=638.62s)]
*  being. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=644.86s)]
*  I also feel this as a mother, you know, as a mother, as a parent, you know, as an uncle [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=645.86s)]
*  or an aunt. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=650.18s)]
*  It's intolerable to witness the torture and murder of children on an industrial scale. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=651.18s)]
*  So, you know, it's both the fact that this is live streamed in real time as well as the [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=657.42s)]
*  intensity of the onslaught here, you know, and that's been documented time and again [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=661.9s)]
*  that the degree of the violence, the intensity of the violence, the intensity of the bombing, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=666.62s)]
*  the fact that some eight times the number of bombs dropped on Iraq in six years, you [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=671.6999999999999s)]
*  know, so that full volume of bombing has the volume of bombs dropped on Iraq has been exceeded [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=680.26s)]
*  eightfold in the first 100 days. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=688.02s)]
*  You know, this is just like unbelievably monstrous what's taking place. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=690.22s)]
*  The elimination of hospitals, the assault on hospitals, the mass graves of hundreds [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=694.5400000000001s)]
*  of innocent civilians, patients, doctors and nurses are there by the hundreds in mass graves [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=699.94s)]
*  and at least two of the hospitals that have been destroyed. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=706.86s)]
*  Pretty much all of the hospitals have been destroyed. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=709.74s)]
*  The ambulances, the ambulance drivers, the universities have been flattened, the schools. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=711.86s)]
*  I mean, what's going on now is it's almost beyond compare from anything I have ever seen [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=716.74s)]
*  or heard. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=723.14s)]
*  The entire, you know, the survival of an entire people, their culture is being erased, flattened, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=724.26s)]
*  pulverized. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=731.38s)]
*  You know, it's a monstrous event that's taking place. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=732.38s)]
*  And I think it really challenges us, you know, what is our moral fiber here? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=736.14s)]
*  What is our moral core? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=740.3s)]
*  Because what happens in Gaza, you know, they are normalizing the torture and murder of [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=742.1s)]
*  children. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=747.02s)]
*  They are normalizing the violation of international law. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=748.02s)]
*  They are normalizing the, you know, the abolition of human rights. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=750.98s)]
*  So to sit by and let this happen in Gaza is basically to say that this is okay, you know, [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=755.86s)]
*  for the future of the world. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=761.7s)]
*  Obviously as an independent candidate outside the two-party system, as a Green Party candidate, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=763.9000000000001s)]
*  one of the foundations of your campaign is that you critique the bipartisanship of both [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=768.98s)]
*  political parties in the way in which they agree on things and impose destructive things [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=775.5s)]
*  in the world. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=779.46s)]
*  One of the apparent differences or the claimed differences between the two parties is that [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=780.46s)]
*  Democrats have increasingly embraced theories of censorship when it comes to things like [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=785.46s)]
*  They've worked with the security state to impose a censorship regime on the internet, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=790.6600000000001s)]
*  whereas conservatives and Republicans were saying how profoundly opposed they were to [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=794.7800000000001s)]
*  this kind of suppression of free political speech. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=800.38s)]
*  Since October 7th, what we've seen is not a debate but essentially a union between those [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=805.0200000000001s)]
*  two groups yet again to essentially insist that criticism of Israel should be deemed [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=810.6600000000001s)]
*  hate speech, that it should be deemed to be inherently violent. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=816.0999999999999s)]
*  There's now a concerted effort to shut down these political protests, including ones that [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=819.66s)]
*  are entirely peaceful. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=825.7399999999999s)]
*  What do you make of this kind of unity between Democrats and Republicans when it comes to [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=827.8199999999999s)]
*  questions regarding Israel and even attacks on our free speech rights in the name of shielding it? [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=832.9799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=840.3399999999999s)]
*  Unfortunately, this is an example of where Democrats and Republicans converge basically [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=841.62s)]
*  on an agenda of war and Wall Street. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=847.22s)]
*  They both share the agenda of bailing out Wall Street whenever it needs it. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=851.74s)]
*  The Democratic and Republican consensus after the crooks crashed Wall Street in 2008, they [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=858.58s)]
*  were quick to bail them out to the tune of trillions of dollars even while the American [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=865.82s)]
*  public was screaming, don't do it. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=869.8199999999999s)]
*  So Wall Street got bailed out and everyday people got thrown out losing their homes by [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=872.3399999999999s)]
*  the millions. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=876.8199999999999s)]
*  Appropriations for Ukraine or for Israel, they're a dime a dozen and the Republicans [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=879.9s)]
*  may grandstand based on usually not compelling issues like they wanted to militarize the [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=889.66s)]
*  border before they provided the funding for Ukraine. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=897.38s)]
*  But on basic issues, unfortunately, there's widespread agreement here and they're both very much [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=901.5s)]
*  in the pocket. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=909.1s)]
*  Joe Biden appointed a former member of the Raytheon board of directors to be the secretary of [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=910.5s)]
*  defense. So they're both really joined at the hip with the war industry, the war profiteers and [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=917.78s)]
*  with Wall Street. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=926.34s)]
*  So the differences between them, I think, are pretty shallow and superficial. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=927.34s)]
*  Unfortunately, they're all pretty much taking their marching orders from APAC and the war [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=931.46s)]
*  profiteers and ignoring the overwhelming consensus of the American people that they want an immediate [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=936.5s)]
*  ceasefire and a negotiated solution. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=943.7800000000001s)]
*  Just a couple of questions more with the time we have left. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=945.74s)]
*  There was just a recent poll out this week from one of the more credible polling agencies [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=951.94s)]
*  that says that 70% of Americans think that the economy is going poorly and a similar percentage, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=955.7s)]
*  66%, disapprove of Biden's handling of the economy. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=963.1400000000001s)]
*  Now, and this is very consistent with polling down the way we've seen for over a year now. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=967.1400000000001s)]
*  Now, if you listen to liberal pundits, the sort of loyalists of the Democratic Party, they will insist [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=971.1400000000001s)]
*  that the data shows that the economy actually is doing quite well and there are actual metrics and [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=976.34s)]
*  data that you can point to that suggest that there's been improvement in the economy since the COVID [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=981.86s)]
*  pandemic and the like. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=986.18s)]
*  And they basically, in this kind of very now characteristic democratic way, are almost saying that the [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=987.4599999999999s)]
*  people in the country are stupid, that they don't realize how good they have it and they're kind of [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=993.78s)]
*  malcontents. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=997.78s)]
*  Why do you think that even though you can point to some data that suggests that some things have [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=999.4599999999999s)]
*  improved, that so many Americans on such a widespread basis believe the economy is going so poorly for [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1004.5799999999999s)]
*  them? [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1009.86s)]
*  Well, I think there's a lot of data to show that if you're not in the upper 10% or so, if you're not [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1011.7s)]
*  heavily invested in the stock market, the economy really is pretty devastating for most working [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1017.54s)]
*  people. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1025.46s)]
*  Most working people are living with incredible insecurity right now. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1025.78s)]
*  If they make ends meet, it's generally by going into debt. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1029.94s)]
*  So we know 63% of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1032.9s)]
*  We know that half of all renters are severely economically stressed trying to keep a roof over [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1037.6999999999998s)]
*  their heads, paying more than 30% of their income just to pay their rent, which doesn't leave much [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1042.82s)]
*  money to pay their student debt, which is also just really devastating to 44 million Americans, [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1048.5s)]
*  100 million Americans who are in medical debt, 87 million Americans who are either underinsured or [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1054.8999999999999s)]
*  not insured at all. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1062.7399999999998s)]
*  Child poverty rates have doubled. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1064.4199999999998s)]
*  Homelessness is at a record high. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1066.66s)]
*  If you poll young people, people under 25, 50% of young people say that they are hopeless about the [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1071.22s)]
*  future. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1078.98s)]
*  One quarter of young people say that they have considered harming themselves because of this [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1079.7s)]
*  fact within the last two weeks of the poll, which is an absolutely terrifying metric about the state [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1086.58s)]
*  of our society. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1093.22s)]
*  Things are not going well once you get beyond the upper crust. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1094.9s)]
*  So there may be these macroeconomic indicators that are okay because the upper crust is doing so [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1099.0600000000002s)]
*  well, but the vast majority of people are pretty desperate now and only becoming more so while [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1105.3s)]
*  Congress appropriates almost $100 billion at the drop of a hat in order to conduct more war, which [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1111.3s)]
*  is impoverishing us 50% of our Congressional budget. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1119.62s)]
*  In fact, more of that is being spent on the endless war machine, which is doing nothing but [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1122.74s)]
*  creating failed states, mass refugee migrations, continuing terrorist threats, and not making the [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1127.22s)]
*  world a safer place, in fact, making the world a much more dangerous place. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1133.3s)]
*  So what's wrong with this picture? [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1136.6599999999999s)]
*  What's wrong with this picture is that our electoral system, our democracy has pretty much [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1138.74s)]
*  been sold to the highest bidder. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1144.1s)]
*  This is what's driving policy, why we have Congress voting in pretty much lockstep to [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1146.74s)]
*  continue funding this stuff while the needs of the American people are just desperately met. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1151.3799999999999s)]
*  So fortunately, a lot of people are saying enough is enough and it's really time to stand up. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1155.9399999999998s)]
*  There are going to be three pro-war, pro-genocide, anti-worker campaigns on the ballot. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1160.98s)]
*  That is RFK, Biden, and Trump. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1167.3s)]
*  Our campaign is the only anti-war, anti-genocide, pro-worker campaign that is on track to be on [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1169.78s)]
*  the ballot across the country. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1176.74s)]
*  It is likely to be a four-way race. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1178.42s)]
*  If the vote is split four ways, in fact, it can be one with as little as 26%. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1180.82s)]
*  Recently, we've been running 8% in the most recent poll in Wisconsin and 22% [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1186.1000000000001s)]
*  among people 30 and under. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1193.94s)]
*  Bernie Sanders percolated along at 2% to 3% until he broke through in 2016 in the primary. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1195.3s)]
*  So I'd say, hold on to your hats. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1201.62s)]
*  We don't know what's happening, what the outcome of this election will be. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1203.46s)]
*  But the American people are in uprising now for very good reason in spite of the propaganda [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1206.98s)]
*  of the Democrats to just tell you to sit down, be good little boys and girls, and be happy [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1212.6599999999999s)]
*  with your very screwed over life as it is. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1217.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1221.1399999999999s)]
*  There's no question there's massive evidence of systemic discontent with both political [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1221.54s)]
*  parties and there's a huge opening, I think, more so than ever before. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1226.1s)]
*  Just one or two questions about... [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1229.54s)]
*  You mentioned a couple of times the war in Ukraine. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1231.22s)]
*  You know the argument against pulling out or ceasing to fund it. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1232.82s)]
*  The Republicans, Democrats just united to send another $60 billion to Ukraine. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1237.7s)]
*  They got Mike Johnson to just switch completely the view that he had claimed for years he [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1243.54s)]
*  believed in, not just on that but on warrantless eavesdropping and the like. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1248.5s)]
*  So we're sending another $60 billion to fuel that war to keep it continuing. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1251.54s)]
*  The argument, of course, is that if we don't, the Russians would just overrun Ukraine, [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1255.38s)]
*  that the Ukrainians would lose their country, that Russia would annex it and take it over, [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1259.62s)]
*  and that we can't allow that to happen. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1263.06s)]
*  What's your response to that critique? [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1265.14s)]
*  Well, that is a mythology, you know, and experts in the region, John Mer-Shymer and [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1268.42s)]
*  people like that who know the region, you know, are pretty clear, as the evidence is clear, [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1275.7s)]
*  that Russia actually cannot afford to expand as an empire. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1280.74s)]
*  It can't take that on. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1285.22s)]
*  Russia is defending its border, which the U.S. has done as well when Russia put [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1286.26s)]
*  nuclear missiles in Cuba. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1292.42s)]
*  We had launched the nuclear bombs into the air. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1293.78s)]
*  We were not going to allow our border to be threatened by nuclear missiles. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1296.18s)]
*  And with the expansion of NATO eastward, there are nuclear compatible missiles now on Russia's [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1301.9399999999998s)]
*  border. Russia did not want to see that happening along the very extensive Ukrainian border as well. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1307.62s)]
*  Russia was very clear from the outset what it wanted was neutrality, explicit neutrality for [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1313.2199999999998s)]
*  Ukraine after the war was begun. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1318.4199999999998s)]
*  You know, and Russia has been offering to basically make a deal and hold to a deal [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1321.06s)]
*  before the war in an effort to avoid it. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1327.86s)]
*  This war was predicted. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1330.26s)]
*  It was understood to be an inevitable consequence of violating the promise that was made to [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1331.94s)]
*  Gorbachev, you know, whenever it was the... [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1338.5s)]
*  And the fall of the Berlin Wall in the late 1980s. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1341.54s)]
*  Exactly. That the reunification of Germany was dependent on the guarantee that NATO would not [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1346.74s)]
*  be expanding further to the east. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1353.22s)]
*  And that began to be violated shortly after the agreement was made, and especially under [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1355.38s)]
*  Clinton, NATO began to march to the east. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1361.38s)]
*  And it was clear that this war was in the offing, but all that needed to be done was to abide by [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1363.7s)]
*  that promise that was made at that time to Gorbachev. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1368.42s)]
*  So this was an absolutely avoidable war. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1374.0200000000002s)]
*  Russia simply wanted to defend its border. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1376.5800000000002s)]
*  It's been invaded across that Ukrainian border many times over the course of history. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1378.74s)]
*  And most recently, they lost 27 million people. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1383.78s)]
*  They are touchy about their border. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1386.5s)]
*  It would have required absolutely nothing from the U.S. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1389.7s)]
*  It would have been no loss of power or status or anything to simply have respected the Minsk [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1392.82s)]
*  Accords, which were negotiated on that basis, or simply the request for neutrality for Ukraine. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1398.02s)]
*  This would have been an easy win here. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1403.3799999999999s)]
*  But, you know, for very, you know, just wrongheaded reasons, you know, the U.S. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1407.3s)]
*  has an explicit military policy known as full-spectrum dominance that we will not [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1412.58s)]
*  allow competitors to emerge in any region of the world and will suppress those competitors. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1417.3s)]
*  And the U.S. has been, you know, quite insistent on suppressing any further development of Russia [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1423.22s)]
*  and the potential for Russia to emerge as a regional power. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1430.42s)]
*  We didn't want to see that. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1433.62s)]
*  So we've been, you know, bleeding Ukraine in order to bleed Russia. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1434.74s)]
*  And this is just a disaster for the people of Ukraine. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1438.34s)]
*  And it's really shameful. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1442.34s)]
*  We could, you know, Russia is not a threat here. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1444.4199999999998s)]
*  It's not a threat. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1449.54s)]
*  Unfortunately, to end the war now because a lot of territory has been taken, as was predicted, [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1450.58s)]
*  as Barack Obama himself acknowledged, this wasn't an area to begin a fight because Russia has every [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1457.3799999999999s)]
*  reason to defend its borders here. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1464.1s)]
*  And we do not. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1465.9399999999998s)]
*  This is not our territory. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1467.1399999999999s)]
*  So this was predictable. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1468.82s)]
*  It's going to be more difficult to negotiate a solution right now. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1471.22s)]
*  But Russia has, you know, continued to negotiate even after the war. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1473.7s)]
*  And, you know, there will be more concessions at this stage of the game. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1479.06s)]
*  But, you know, what are we going to do? [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1483.46s)]
*  Bleed Ukraine to death? [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1485.8600000000001s)]
*  You know, and we've got two wars now and potentially a third, you know, if the [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1487.38s)]
*  warmongers get their way, they're warmongering against China as well. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1492.34s)]
*  This is nuts. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1495.78s)]
*  This endangers us all. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1496.9s)]
*  There are nuclear threats here. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1498.66s)]
*  The potential for this to explode into a nuclear conflict. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1500.58s)]
*  And likewise, there is also in the Middle East with Netanyahu trying to drag us into a wider war [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1503.1399999999999s)]
*  with Iran and attacking the Iranian embassy. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1510.58s)]
*  And Iran is networked with Russia. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1513.22s)]
*  So this could all get very complicated and potentially nuclear at the drop of the hat. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1514.8999999999999s)]
*  It's very important for us to say, you know, this is over. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1519.46s)]
*  This is not advancing security for the people of Ukraine. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1523.06s)]
*  It's really, you know, a horrible, terrible, costly mistake that the U.S. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1526.82s)]
*  bullied its way into this war to start with. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1532.82s)]
*  Yes, it was illegal and criminal for Putin to launch the attack on Ukraine. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1535.3799999999999s)]
*  And that is, you know, absolutely war crimes that are being committed here on both sides, [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1542.1799999999998s)]
*  of course. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1547.78s)]
*  But this was absolutely avoidable. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1548.1799999999998s)]
*  Russia wanted to prevent this war and the U.S. insisted on forcing it forward. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1550.8999999999999s)]
*  And when there was an opportunity to negotiate and there was a treaty which was ready to be signed, [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1557.1399999999999s)]
*  the U.S. disrupted it in order to keep the war going. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1562.1s)]
*  We need to stop. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1564.6599999999999s)]
*  Enough is enough. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1565.86s)]
*  Enough Ukrainians have died. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1566.6599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and as sensitive and touchy as you said about how the Russians are with that part of the [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1568.82s)]
*  border, they get even touchier when they hear German leaders vowing to pursue the [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1573.7s)]
*  glories of victory over the Russian army until the end and then sending German tanks [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1578.9s)]
*  eastward through Europe into Ukraine right up to the Russian border as the Germans have been doing. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1582.98s)]
*  Last question. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1588.5s)]
*  There are a lot of things Democrats are not very good at. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1590.98s)]
*  One of the things they're particularly poor at is accepting responsibility for their own defeats. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1592.98s)]
*  They, in 2000, to this day, blame that 2000 loss not on themselves but on Ralph Nader. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1597.14s)]
*  In 2016, they blame, to this day, that loss on a variety of people, WikiLeaks, The New York Times, [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1603.9399999999998s)]
*  Russia, but especially you. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1609.9399999999998s)]
*  And you know the argument, which is that your candidacy, however eloquent you may be and [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1611.62s)]
*  however noble your platform might be, that the only actual effect of it is that you are stealing [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1616.34s)]
*  votes that the Democrats are entitled to that they apparently think they own. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1621.9399999999998s)]
*  And because of your candidacy, a bunch of people who would vote for Biden are going to vote for you [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1626.9799999999998s)]
*  instead and therefore jeopardize Biden's ability to beat Donald Trump. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1632.26s)]
*  What is your answer to that? [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1636.1s)]
*  No one owns your vote. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1639.3s)]
*  No one is entitled to your vote. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1640.42s)]
*  Politicians need to earn your vote. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1641.94s)]
*  And anyone who tries to intimidate you or to extort your vote based on the notion that they own it [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1644.26s)]
*  doesn't deserve even consideration of your vote if they are trying to prevent you from [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1651.78s)]
*  doing what you need to do and you want to do. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1656.18s)]
*  Your vote is not meaningful unless it expresses what you want to do. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1658.66s)]
*  And silence is not a political strategy. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1664.74s)]
*  Let me point out that starting with Ralph Nader, he put Medicare for All, called single payer at [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1668.98s)]
*  the time, on the map, on the political map. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1675.22s)]
*  In our campaign, we put free public higher education and abolishing student debt on the map. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1677.78s)]
*  We put reparations on the map and ranked choice voting, a way to make this issue and this question [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1684.66s)]
*  of vote splitting absolutely a moot problem entirely. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1691.7s)]
*  So, green have made a very powerful impact on the political agenda. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1695.78s)]
*  The Democrats adopt that agenda, but they don't actually fulfill that agenda. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1703.1399999999999s)]
*  And here we are, you know, continuing to go down the tubes. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1707.54s)]
*  So, I'd say it's important to stand up and fight back against anyone who is trying to [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1710.4199999999998s)]
*  silence your political agency because, you know, power concedes nothing without a demand. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1716.74s)]
*  It never has and it never will. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1722.4199999999998s)]
*  We need to stand up for what we need, not simply against who we hate the most, which is kind of how [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1723.86s)]
*  our system works right now. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1729.9399999999998s)]
*  We need to stand up for what we need and support a candidate who's actually going to deliver that. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1731.3799999999999s)]
*  Otherwise, we are not going to move forward and we are continuing to basically go over a cliff [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1736.02s)]
*  right now. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1740.98s)]
*  We're on a trajectory which is extremely dangerous and I think people are more ready than ever [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1741.46s)]
*  to stand up and fight for what it is that we need. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1747.7s)]
*  The world, our lives depend, our world depends, I think, on our changing course right now and [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1751.3799999999999s)]
*  a lot of people know that and are ready to act on it. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1756.82s)]
*  Well, I'd be willing to bet a lot of money that there are a lot of people who may not agree with [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1759.22s)]
*  every last one of your positions and platforms but who are so happy that there are people who [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1763.22s)]
*  are willing to try and expand our discourse and our debate beyond this kind of dreary, [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1767.78s)]
*  bipartisan consensus that keeps us all imprisoned in this kind of jail cell that is so suffocating [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1773.38s)]
*  and so limiting. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1781.14s)]
*  I'm so happy that you're doing what you're doing. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1782.18s)]
*  I think it takes a lot of courage. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1783.8600000000001s)]
*  I think you are having a very positive effect on our country's politics and I hope and I'm sure [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1786.1000000000001s)]
*  that you will continue and as you do we will continue to report on it and hope to have you [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1793.22s)]
*  back on the show. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsljMQOzJXE&t=1796.18s)]
