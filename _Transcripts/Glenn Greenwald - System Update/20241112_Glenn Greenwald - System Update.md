# What Do Trump's Personnel Picks Reveal About Next Admin?
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [November 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms)
*  So there have been, there's been a lot of questions and a lot of confusion now that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=0.0s)]
*  Donald Trump is one about what the second Trump administration is going to look like. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=11.88s)]
*  Will it be similar to the first Trump administration that was beset by all sorts of factional infighting [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=16.44s)]
*  by people who were able to burrow their way into the Trump administration even though [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=23.84s)]
*  they were clearly there to sabotage and undermine what Donald Trump said his agenda was, what [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=28.86s)]
*  they were really impeded by all sorts of media scandals that they had to constantly attend [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=35.7s)]
*  to and as a result I think there was a lot of ideological incoherence in Donald Trump's [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=41.34s)]
*  administration both in terms of economic policy and foreign policy. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=46.5s)]
*  Remember for example that the 2016 campaign of Donald Trump's was very oriented toward [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=51.06s)]
*  economic populism. Steve Bannon's plan was let's get into office, raise taxes on the rich, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=57.3s)]
*  then do a bipartisan infrastructure bill to create jobs and then build a wall and instead [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=62.9s)]
*  the first thing Donald Trump did was not anything remotely populist but anti-populist which was cut [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=69.22s)]
*  taxes on very large corporations. So there was always this kind of tension between things that [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=75.02s)]
*  Trump clearly believed and things that the Trump administration did and a lot of the explanation [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=82.06s)]
*  was well look there's just certain, you need time to understand how Washington works and if you don't [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=86.26s)]
*  have that you'll get thwarted and defeated and subverted by a lot of the permanent power factions [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=91.06s)]
*  in Washington, the administrative state, the US security state and so a lot of Donald Trump's [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=96.46000000000001s)]
*  promises about what the second administration would be was that it would not be driven by [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=102.34s)]
*  neoconservatives or interventionists or warmongers of the kind that Donald Trump has long railed [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=106.34s)]
*  against and there was a lot of concern over the last several weeks that people like Mike Pompeo [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=112.3s)]
*  and Nikki Haley who embody that ideology would be part of his administration and in response to [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=117.78s)]
*  those concerns Trump announced and obviously in general you don't announce who won't be part of [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=124.7s)]
*  your administration but Trump decided to try and signal to his base that he would not be going in [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=130.54s)]
*  that direction again and he said the following quote, I will not be inviting former ambassador [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=136.74s)]
*  Nikki Haley or former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to join the Trump administration which is [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=140.94s)]
*  currently in formation. I very much enjoyed and appreciated working with them previously and would [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=147.06s)]
*  like to thank them for their service to our country. Make America great again. Now that came after Ben [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=152.1s)]
*  Shapiro went on the free press a couple of weeks ago and basically said that he was certain that [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=158.57999999999998s)]
*  Mike Pompeo was going to be part of the Trump administration that gave Ben Shapiro a lot of [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=166.34s)]
*  comfort because Mike Pompeo has a similar foreign policy to Ben Shapiro when it comes to wars, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=171.78s)]
*  interventions and especially Israel. Here's what Ben Shapiro said. From a policy perspective do [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=176.78s)]
*  you think a Harris administration would be better on Israel than a Trump administration? I do because [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=182.26000000000002s)]
*  it would be staffed by sane people and what we have again do you want Mr. Pillow guy in the [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=187.38s)]
*  conversation with Mike Flynn and Candace Owens who's going to be in there? Jack Psobiak? No, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=195.38s)]
*  I mean there's a policy Mike Pompeo and David Friedman are the most likely people to be in the [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=201.54s)]
*  administration and on Kamala Harris's side it's most likely to be Philip Gordon. He is surrounded [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=205.26s)]
*  by grifters and maniacs. Sam I know precisely the people talking to him. I'm not speculating about [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=208.85999999999999s)]
*  that. All right so Ben Shapiro strongly suggested that Mike Pompeo was going to be part of the [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=216.46s)]
*  administration. I think Trump for whatever reasons said to preempt this concern okay they're not [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=222.3s)]
*  going to be part of my administration. Now that was taken as a fairly positive sign by a lot of [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=229.98000000000002s)]
*  people concerned about the infiltration of warmongers and neoconservatives into the Trump [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=238.02s)]
*  administration that he was going to be making an effort to keep such people out and in response to [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=242.66000000000003s)]
*  that Dave Smith who I think has become one of the most incisive political commentators said the [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=249.5s)]
*  following quote the stop pump the stop stop Pompeo movement is great but it's not enough right now we [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=255.82s)]
*  need maximum pressure to keep all neocons and war hawks out of the Trump administration they [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=262.82s)]
*  have had their time at the table and brought nothing but disaster to the world and to this [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=269.02s)]
*  country and above that Donald Trump jr. who by all accounts and my information as well is exercising [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=274.1s)]
*  more influence than he previously ever has and I think he's one of the people in the Trump's in [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=282.90000000000003s)]
*  Trump's most inner circle most opposed to these kinds of neocons and to these kinds of war hawks [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=289.06s)]
*  in response to Dave Smith saying stopping Pompeo is not enough we have to stop all people like that [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=294.58000000000004s)]
*  from getting into Trump's administration Donald Trump said I'm agreeing agreed 100 100 100% I'm [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=301.86s)]
*  on it basically saying look I agree with you and these are not going to be the kind of people who [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=307.38s)]
*  were who are going to be in the administration now in response to Trump's announcement that neither [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=312.65999999999997s)]
*  Mike Pompeo nor Nikki Haley would be in his administration the Wall Street Journal a bad [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=319.62s)]
*  page which is very aligned with the Bush Cheney Republican establishment foreign policy had a [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=325.53999999999996s)]
*  conniption a sort of fit and they editorialized as follows on November 10th quote behind Trump's [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=331.42s)]
*  Mike Pompeo ban Don Jr. and his allies veto Nikki Haley and the former secretary of state for the [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=338.21999999999997s)]
*  cabinet they don't want competition for JD Vance in 2028 quote the Pompeo ban makes more sense in [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=345.26s)]
*  light of the charging height changing hierarchy behind the scenes in Mr. Trump's world Mr. Trump's [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=351.9s)]
*  son Don Jr. is wielding greater influence as is the media provocateur Tucker Carlson and their [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=357.18s)]
*  coterie they lobbied hard to make JD Vance Mr. Trump's running mate and they're already pulling [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=363.90000000000003s)]
*  strings to make him heir apparent they'd like to block anyone who might challenge Mr. Vance from [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=369.1s)]
*  gaining stature by holding a cabinet position in the second Trump term now that's the speculative [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=373.82s)]
*  gossip here's the key quote there is also a foreign policy calculation at work Mr. Pompeo [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=380.22s)]
*  and Ms. Haley believed in real robust U.S. leadership in the world including support for [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=386.46s)]
*  Ukraine NATO and alliances in the specific the Don Jr. crowd and Mr. Vance want to pull back [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=391.5s)]
*  from some of those commitments one online one online MAGA acolyte which is Dave Smith who's [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=398.14s)]
*  name they didn't want to use tweeted Sunday what we just showed you the Stomp Pompeo movement is [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=404.62s)]
*  great but right now we it's not enough we have to keep maximum pressure to keep all the neocons and [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=408.78s)]
*  war hawks out of the Trump administration Don Jr. retweeted his assent agree 100 percent I'm on it [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=413.82s)]
*  we told you before the election that Don Jr. was emerging as an inside power player but we wonder [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=419.82s)]
*  if his father likes this boasting that the kid is telling dad what to do obviously trying to provoke [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=424.21999999999997s)]
*  Trump to not listen to Don Jr. anymore when he says keep neocons out it isn't clear where the [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=430.38s)]
*  president-elect will come out on all of this and the cabinet choices he does make will tell us more [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=435.98s)]
*  but the ban on Mr. Pompeo who would have made a fine defense secretary and Arkansas defense [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=441.66s)]
*  Tom Cotton's declaration that he wants to remain in the Senate aren't favorable signs for Trump [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=448.38000000000005s)]
*  foreign policy in other words they are favorable signs for Trump's foreign policy they signal [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=453.66s)]
*  that Donald Trump is trying to avoid the infiltration of neocons and warmongers in his [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=459.18s)]
*  cabinet though that's what it seemed like as of December 10th when he announced that [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=465.9s)]
*  preemptive banning of Nikki Haley and Mike Pompeo what then happened though was that [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=473.09999999999997s)]
*  Trump began announcing more appointees to his national security team and in many ways it went [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=482.38s)]
*  in the exact opposite direction it started including people whose foreign policy views [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=490.46s)]
*  are basically indistinguishable from Mike Pompeo's and Nikki Haley's in fact the position that Nikki [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=496.53999999999996s)]
*  Haley occupied in the first Trump term which was UN ambassador to US ambassador to the UN [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=504.78s)]
*  is now going to be filled by congresswoman Elise Stefanik as the New York Times reported yesterday [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=510.46s)]
*  Trump offers Elise Stefanik a role as UN ambassador quote Ms. Stefanik who represents an upstate New [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=516.46s)]
*  York district in the house and is a member of the Republican leadership in the chamber has been a [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=522.94s)]
*  vocal supporter of Mr. Trump she has been an outspoken supporter of Israel and had a high [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=527.82s)]
*  profile role in the congressional hearings that led to the resignation of several university [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=533.1s)]
*  presidents over their handling of campus unrest following the terror attack by Hamas on Israel [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=537.9000000000001s)]
*  and the subsequent war in Gaza in a statement Mr. Trump called her a quote strong tough and [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=543.26s)]
*  smart America first fighter and she's a vocal supporter of the US war in Ukraine [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=548.06s)]
*  she tried to right before the election kind of give a signal that she was trying to wield in [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=558.86s)]
*  rein in some of the unlimited spending but she has a worldview that is very aligned with Nikki Haley [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=566.22s)]
*  and Mike Pompeo so it's good that Mike Pompeo and Nikki Haley are banned but the fact that [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=572.3s)]
*  Elise Stefanik who's probably well definitely as much of a supporter of Israel's as Nikki Haley [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=578.78s)]
*  and who has become a vocal supporter of all these foreign policy views in general is going to now be [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=586.9399999999999s)]
*  taking Nikki Haley's place so you can question how significant was the ban on Nikki Haley [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=593.8199999999999s)]
*  right before we went on air just a few minutes before we did Trump announced his choice for [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=599.6600000000001s)]
*  national security advisor which is obviously an important position that is a person who advises [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=607.34s)]
*  Donald Trump on national security matters is his top national security advisor in the White House [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=612.5400000000001s)]
*  and for that position he chose Congressman Mike Waltz of Florida who was a former Green Beret [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=618.22s)]
*  who was deployed in Iraq and he has a very hawkish and hardline view on things like supporting [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=625.66s)]
*  the US war in Ukraine in fact his criticism has been that [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=636.54s)]
*  Joe Biden and Kamal Harris hadn't done enough he's also now saying things like we have to rein in the [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=645.42s)]
*  blank check but he is he actually Mike Waltz worked with Liz Cheney to oppose Trump's plan [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=652.06s)]
*  to withdraw from Afghanistan saying that look I'm sorry I know you want to leave Afghanistan was [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=661.26s)]
*  his view but you have to accept this is an intergenerational war we're there to fight terrorism [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=665.9799999999999s)]
*  and we have to stay until we win even if it means we stay several more decades he's also very hawkish [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=672.14s)]
*  on China he is a skeptic on NATO he believes that NATO countries should be forced to spend a lot [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=677.66s)]
*  more money on their defense because it's unfair to the United States something that Donald Trump [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=685.26s)]
*  vehemently believes he's been a long-time Trump supporter so Mike Waltz who is definitely not an [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=688.38s)]
*  anti-interventionist to put it mildly is the person who will be national security advisor and [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=693.98s)]
*  then after we went on the air Trump announced his choice for secretary of state that person will be [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=700.14s)]
*  Senator Marco Rubio the Republican of Florida now as you might remember Marco Rubio in 2016 was one [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=707.5s)]
*  of the people who ran against Donald Trump along with Jeb Bush in fact once Jeb Bush was dispatched [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=715.1s)]
*  Marco Rubio became the choice of the Republican establishment and Donald Trump frequently [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=721.74s)]
*  criticized him at the time validly so for being one of those neocons for being one of those war [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=725.5s)]
*  hawks Marco Rubio is a fanatical supporter for example of US funding of the war in Ukraine [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=731.26s)]
*  he's been an ardent supporter of every American intervention he will do anything to finance and [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=738.38s)]
*  arm Israel and its war so these last three choices are conflicting with the first two with that ban on [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=746.14s)]
*  uh Nikki Haley and and Mike Pompeo at the same time JD Vance who was his vice president's choice [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=756.14s)]
*  was campaigned for by people like Donald Trump jr and Tucker Carlson [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=764.7s)]
*  was a choice that signaled a more populous bent I can't you can find statements from JD Vance [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=770.0600000000001s)]
*  that are supportive of Republican foreign policy but you can find a lot of ones that are very [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=778.7s)]
*  skeptical of it as well and that's why neocons like the wall street journal page were [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=782.78s)]
*  very angry at the choice of JD Vance instead of Marco Rubio for uh for vice president so I think [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=788.3s)]
*  what you have here is something that seems quite similar to me to be what shaped and drove Trump's [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=797.1s)]
*  first term as president I don't think Trump likes to give anyone too much power to make any faction [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=805.18s)]
*  feel like they have him under their thumb I think enjoys putting different factions in power giving [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=814.54s)]
*  some people some things giving other people other things and on some level we can sit here and try [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=823.5s)]
*  and decipher every signal from every one of these appointees about the direction in which Trump is [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=829.3399999999999s)]
*  going but I think what Trump has proven is that he often operates by instinct he's not very reliable [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=834.54s)]
*  ideologically you don't really know what Trump's going to do so he has been very clear that he [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=843.02s)]
*  wants the war in Ukraine to be over the only way the war in Ukraine can be over is by handing the [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=848.9399999999999s)]
*  parts of Ukraine that Russia occupies over to Russia and there are critical people that he's [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=855.18s)]
*  now appointed in top level national security positions including Elise Stefanik and Mike [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=861.5s)]
*  Waltz and Marco Rubio the last three who would be vehement opponents of doing that [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=866.62s)]
*  the same is true for trying to end the war in Gaza or the war in Lebanon these are a lot of people [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=873.58s)]
*  who have beaten their chest and the war drums about war in Iran so if you're looking for a [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=879.1s)]
*  series of uniformed anti-interventionists or anti-neocons who Trump is going to select as [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=887.42s)]
*  his key national security positions you're already going to be disappointed Marco Rubio, Michael [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=895.5s)]
*  Waltz, Elise Stefanik do not give any comfort at all in terms of avoiding the repetition of [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=901.3399999999999s)]
*  the problems of the first administration Donald Trump jr.'s vow that he was trying to keep people [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=909.5799999999999s)]
*  like that out I'm sure he tried but clearly Marco Rubio as Secretary of State is something that's [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=914.78s)]
*  going to make every single neocon and standard Republican warmonger very happy and very comfortable [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=920.9399999999999s)]
*  with as well as these others we already know that Mary Madelson has immense power in the Trump [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=927.3399999999999s)]
*  administration this fanatical Israel supporter Trump himself said that she and her husband [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=935.3399999999999s)]
*  Sheldon Adelson were probably the most frequent visitors to the White House in his first term [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=940.22s)]
*  and he gave them everything on Israel including more than what they asked for she now has [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=945.02s)]
*  given him a hundred million dollars for his campaign and obviously expects a lot in return [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=949.66s)]
*  from that so I'm not going to be premature and sit here and describe a Trump administration that has [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=955.26s)]
*  yet to begin and I think one of the things that makes people in establishment institutions so [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=961.18s)]
*  uncomfortable with Trump is that he is quite unpredictable sometimes he will affirm and follow [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=967.26s)]
*  and align with standard DC foreign policy consensus and other times he'll just [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=974.14s)]
*  be ready to blow it up but if you're looking for signals in these early appointments [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=980.9399999999999s)]
*  and these early gestures I don't think you can find any thing that you're here to say that [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=988.54s)]
*  it looks likely like Donald Trump is going to wage war against American [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=994.38s)]
*  neoconservatives or warmongers in Washington but a lot of times the people Donald Trump appoints [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=998.0600000000001s)]
*  are not people who end up expressing the direction in which he will actually go there will be a lot [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=1005.0200000000001s)]
*  of competition a lot of factual conflict over who will influence and drive Donald Trump [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=1011.34s)]
*  you can find people like Tucker Carlson heaping scorn on many of the people that he just named [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=1019.1800000000001s)]
*  there's no question Tucker Carlson is influential in that world same with Donald Trump Jr. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=1023.18s)]
*  but obviously there's a lot of people who are important to Trump and who are close to Trump [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=1028.1399999999999s)]
*  who he also listens to who have very different views so I think it's premature to say the Trump [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=1031.6599999999999s)]
*  administration is going to be this or that especially given the question mark that Donald [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=1037.1799999999998s)]
*  Trump always is and I think that's always been the appeal of Donald Trump I recently heard my [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=1042.3s)]
*  former intercept colleague Jeremy Scahill no fan of Donald Trump describe Trump as a quote [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=1046.78s)]
*  circuit breaker I think he was quoting Seymour Hersh saying that Trump is the only person who [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=1052.22s)]
*  can be a circuit breaker on how the DC bipartisan foreign policy class operates just through his [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=1057.02s)]
*  unpredictability through his obvious descent from a lot of foreign policy dogma and his instincts to [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=1064.14s)]
*  avoid war but he's certainly constructing his administration with people who are in key positions [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=1072.14s)]
*  top jobs who are ardent supporters of the foreign policy that both the Democrat and Republican [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=1078.78s)]
*  establishments like a lot and are very comfortable with culminating in the appointment of Marco Rubio [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=1085.1s)]
*  as his Secretary of State so we will obviously continue to report on this it's one of the big [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=1092.1399999999999s)]
*  concerns about what the second Trump administration would be I think the problem is there were no [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=1096.06s)]
*  question marks about what the Harris administration would be we knew exactly what it would be [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=1100.1399999999999s)]
*  she would be just an empty vessel and servant for establishment dogma and if that's what Trump ends [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=1105.02s)]
*  up being when it comes to foreign policy nothing gained nothing lost but I think the potential [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=1111.5s)]
*  is a lot higher for Trump to buckle from that and deviate from it but there's nothing in these [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=1118.62s)]
*  initial choices that suggests that that's what he's planning on doing [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_aIUbTwms&t=1123.82s)]
