# Richard Medhurst Eviscerates US/UK Govts for Assange Trial
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [February 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4)
*  As a lawyer, you know, I oftentimes would participate in a hearing and in an argument [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=0.0s)]
*  before a court and a lot of times you would get a pretty clear sense of where the judges [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=12.72s)]
*  were likely to rule based on the comments they were making, the way they were treating [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=18.3s)]
*  particular arguments and certain lawyers. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=21.82s)]
*  Having been able to witness that hearing, was there a lot of expression of doubt or [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=24.9s)]
*  skepticism or support by the judges who are going to rule on favor of one side or the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=29.54s)]
*  other? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=34.7s)]
*  Were you able to develop an expectation about how you think this court would rule? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=35.7s)]
*  Well, it is good to see you Glenn and thanks for having me. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=39.14s)]
*  What surprised me this time about the judges is that usually in these hearings with Assange, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=43.099999999999994s)]
*  they would make it their mission to indicate their contempt for him. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=48.14s)]
*  I think during the first bail violation hearing where they sent him to Belmarsh for 52 weeks, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=56.22s)]
*  they called him a narcissist and then during the actual extradition case, they would either [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=62.480000000000004s)]
*  say nothing, like express no interest or they would say something like, you know, trivial [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=67.18s)]
*  and then say style him for four days. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=73.06s)]
*  This time, they were actually asking questions and asking the right questions, which surprised [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=75.1s)]
*  me honestly, because if you look at their backgrounds, and I can get into that afterwards, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=80.25999999999999s)]
*  you would think they really would be against them as all the judges are. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=84.61999999999999s)]
*  One of the questions that they asked, for example, was the names of these informants [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=88.74s)]
*  in the leaks because the US are basically arguing that WikiLeaks and Assange harmed [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=93.25999999999999s)]
*  informants even though the US military said themselves that it's not true. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=99.02s)]
*  One of the judges, her name is Sharp, she asked Assange's lawyers, like, the names [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=105.06s)]
*  of these people in the documents and the disclosures, are they the same ones that committed all [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=109.78s)]
*  these war crimes? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=114.62s)]
*  You know, the torture, the rendition, the killings, the helicopter machine gunning, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=115.62s)]
*  and the answer is like, yeah, not every single one of them, but they all participated in [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=120.94s)]
*  this war machine. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=125.14s)]
*  Another question that they asked, for example, was- [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=127.38s)]
*  In other words, just to stop there because it's such an important point, just to make [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=128.38s)]
*  sure that there's clarity on this. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=131.3s)]
*  The examples that the government was pointing to of names that appeared in the documents [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=133.46s)]
*  and reporting that WikiLeaks published were actual names of the people who performed the [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=139.5s)]
*  acts that were the war crimes that WikiLeaks was reporting on. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=144.12s)]
*  That's not in every case, but at least some of them, even the British government conceded [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=147.94s)]
*  some of the examples they pointed to are the people who were the subject of the reporting. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=153.26000000000002s)]
*  Is that essentially the case? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=156.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=158.66s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, again, it's not every single name, but the point here is that what Assange [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=159.66s)]
*  published had to be published because the risk to informants does not outweigh the public's [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=163.9s)]
*  right to know and the explosive nature of the materials. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=171.26s)]
*  It just doesn't. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=175.46s)]
*  They were telling them, like, if you can deny us this application to make an appeal hearing [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=176.7s)]
*  at the High Court, but when we go to the European Court of Human Rights, because the UK is a [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=181.68s)]
*  founding member of the European Council, so that's an option. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=186.7s)]
*  When we go there, they're going to side with us because they're going to look at what happened [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=189.3s)]
*  here. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=193.18s)]
*  What did Assange and WikiLeaks publish? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=194.18s)]
*  And they're going to say this counts more. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=195.18s)]
*  These videos of war crimes count way more than whatever you're going to attribute to [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=197.58s)]
*  informants. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=202.58s)]
*  And that's what the US lawyers were saying, that informants in Syria and China and Iraq [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=203.58s)]
*  and Afghanistan. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=207.46s)]
*  I mean, again, if you go back to Chelsea Manning's court martial, the DOD themselves are saying [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=208.46s)]
*  they couldn't find a single case of this. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=214.10000000000002s)]
*  Another question that the judges ask, for example, is the death penalty, because the [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=217.56s)]
*  issue with extraditing Assange is not just that he will be put in oppressive conditions, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=222.56s)]
*  which is the reason the whole extradition was blocked in the first place, but there's [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=226.28s)]
*  the rule of specialty. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=229.68s)]
*  So how do you know the United States are not going to add other charges on top of this? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=231.26s)]
*  Let's just explain that. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=236.72s)]
*  In other words, under the law of pretty much every European country which opposes the death [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=238.64000000000001s)]
*  penalty, if there's a chance that the person whose extradition is being sought will face [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=244.24s)]
*  the death penalty under the law, the government is essentially legally barred from extraditing [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=249.88s)]
*  that person. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=255.54000000000002s)]
*  Is that basically the case? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=256.54s)]
*  Yeah, that's absolutely correct. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=258.44s)]
*  And this goes to the second main part of Assange's appeal, which is it's directed at the Home [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=261.36s)]
*  Secretary because they have the final say on extraditions. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=267.82s)]
*  And they were basically saying that you cannot send someone to the United States or any country [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=271.12s)]
*  knowing that there is a risk they could be sentenced to death. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=276.26s)]
*  It's just it's illegal. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=279.12s)]
*  You cannot do that. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=280.12s)]
*  And the judges were seeking clarification from the US lawyers. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=282.16s)]
*  They were saying, is there any guarantee that he won't be sentenced to death? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=285.92s)]
*  And even the US lawyers were saying, no, there isn't really a guarantee. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=291.44s)]
*  So they were basically admitting that, yeah, there's a likelihood that he could be given [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=294.48s)]
*  the death penalty. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=299.48s)]
*  The US could say, you know, these are capital offenses and then sentence him to death. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=300.64s)]
*  And I should also just point out that even if you give Assange, let's say, 30 years in [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=305.8s)]
*  prison, he's 50 now. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=309.44s)]
*  It's akin to a death sentence. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=311.38s)]
*  And the prison they want to send him to, ADX Colorado, is a supermax prison. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=312.84s)]
*  You know, the former warden said, once you go in, you never see the sun again. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=317.96s)]
*  It's a hellhole. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=322.4s)]
*  You know, and so it was interesting seeing the high court justices ask these questions [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=323.84s)]
*  because typically a lot of these judges, they have ties to MI6, they have ties to the British [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=328.88s)]
*  establishment. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=333.44s)]
*  And, you know, they basically hate people like Assange because Assange really put the [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=334.84000000000003s)]
*  spotlight on the US and UK war machine. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=339.28000000000003s)]
*  And, you know, they don't like anything that actually democratizes or actually does [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=343.08000000000004s)]
*  journalism. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=350.56s)]
*  So that was really surprising to see from the high court justices that they were actually [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=351.40000000000003s)]
*  interested and they asked these specific questions. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=355.6s)]
*  Yeah, you know, when I was doing this noted reporting, I was involved with almost every [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=358.40000000000003s)]
*  country in Europe where we're doing specific reporting. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=363.0s)]
*  But obviously, the UK was the country with which we are most involved after the United [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=365.92s)]
*  States, in part because I was at the British Guardian. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=369.56s)]
*  But I had the case where the British government detained my husband and also invaded the [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=371.36s)]
*  Guardian newsroom. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=376.04s)]
*  And I had lost all faith in the British judiciary. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=376.96000000000004s)]
*  I think it was probably the country with the most authoritarian culture in terms of condemning [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=380.36s)]
*  the idea that journalists should ever report on anything that the government has decreed [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=384.88s)]
*  ought to be a secret. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=390.2s)]
*  And so I certainly don't have very much expectation in the independence of the British [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=391.11999999999995s)]
*  judiciary. And it's, I think, encouraging to hear you say that although you're not [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=396.56s)]
*  predicting the outcome, it sounds like they were at least trying to be more dignified in [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=400.08s)]
*  recognizing that there are some really serious problems with this extradition request in a [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=405.03999999999996s)]
*  way that you didn't expect. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=410.08s)]
*  Let me ask you, you alluded to this appeal that Assange by legal right would have where [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=411.8s)]
*  even if he loses in what is essentially effectively just describe it as shorthand, kind of [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=417.92s)]
*  like the British Supreme Court, it's the highest and last appeal that he would have within [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=422.88s)]
*  the British judiciary. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=428.24s)]
*  But he would then have an appeal to European courts because Britain, even though they left [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=429.88s)]
*  the EU, is still subject to these conventions and treaties that guarantee a whole bunch of [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=434.24s)]
*  rights that Assange is claiming are violated. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=439.4s)]
*  But as a practical matter, if the British High Court rejects Assange argument and approves [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=441.8s)]
*  the US extradition request, you have a government that has made very clear they despise [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=450.03999999999996s)]
*  Assange, a Tory government. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=454.4s)]
*  The Home Secretary just is a new Home Secretary, but still, I presume, has a lot of [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=456.88s)]
*  hostility toward Assange and a lot of loyalty to the United States. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=461.12s)]
*  Is there a possibility that they could act very, very quickly? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=464.44s)]
*  In other words, wait for this hearing and before Assange can even file his appeal, take [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=468.04s)]
*  him and put him on a plane and send him to the United States. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=473.36s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, everything you said is so true about the culture in the UK. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=477.44s)]
*  And just as a quick note, they didn't even want people to report on this case. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=482.32000000000005s)]
*  And it's been the entire time because they wanted to be like a secret trial. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=486.68s)]
*  But yes, under the European Convention on Human Rights, they can issue an Order 39, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=491.6s)]
*  which could basically stay the extradition. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=497.44s)]
*  So that basically they could not just put Assange on a plane and then send him to the [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=501.16s)]
*  United States. So the thing is that today, you don't know. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=505.44s)]
*  And especially with this case, you don't actually know if the British government are going [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=508.8s)]
*  to comply with that, because there's a probability, albeit a small one, that they could [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=512.32s)]
*  just say, screw it. You know, we do have these obligations under the European Convention [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=516.84s)]
*  on Human Rights, but we're just going to send him anyway. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=522.28s)]
*  That possibility still exists. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=524.96s)]
*  We shouldn't underestimate for one second how brutal and how thuggish the security [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=526.96s)]
*  state can be. And you mentioned the time when they harassed your husband as well. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=533.76s)]
*  This culture hasn't disappeared. It's still there. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=539.4s)]
*  It's absolutely there. So legally, there is there is a way to stop the execution, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=541.28s)]
*  excuse me, the extradition for the time being. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=546.08s)]
*  But when you look at the rights that are being violated, I just want to remind people [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=548.9200000000001s)]
*  these are not like European laws or something. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=552.08s)]
*  They're enshrined in UK law under the Human Rights Act. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=554.48s)]
*  So it's not like something optional. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=558.32s)]
*  The United Kingdom has to respect Julian's rights. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=560.96s)]
*  And almost every single one of them is being violated. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=564.04s)]
*  It's truly incredible. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=567.16s)]
*  If you look at Article 5 under the European Convention on Human Rights, you know, the [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=569.12s)]
*  fact that you can't just arbitrarily put someone in jail, that is what's happening, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=573.72s)]
*  because this is a political offense. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=577.76s)]
*  You know, treason, espionage, these things are classical political offenses. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=579.56s)]
*  So that's a violation of the extradition treaty. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=584.4s)]
*  It's a violation of Article 5. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=586.88s)]
*  If you look at Article 6, the CIA spied on Assange. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=588.84s)]
*  They spied on his conversations with his lawyers. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=591.6s)]
*  How can you spy on someone's privileged conversations with their lawyers and then say [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=594.28s)]
*  that they're getting a fair trial? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=599.04s)]
*  Any case in the world would be thrown out, no matter who we're talking about or what [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=600.52s)]
*  we're talking about. And the fact that if he goes to the US, he'll be given a jury of [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=604.48s)]
*  CIA employees in the district court. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=609.0s)]
*  In Northern Virginia, that's where they're being and his conviction. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=611.76s)]
*  Just anyone tried under the Espionage Act, which is a very repressive law designed to [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=615.84s)]
*  guarantee convictions, automatically is almost condemned to guilt no matter what. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=620.12s)]
*  And then you put someone like Julian Assange in a place where there's military contractors [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=624.0s)]
*  and CIA operatives and pretty much nothing else but that in Northern Virginia. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=628.16s)]
*  And that's the reason they put them there, because they're beyond pro-national security [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=631.92s)]
*  judges. They are just agents of the US security state. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=635.4s)]
*  You a couple of times mentioned when you went to say extradition, you instead said [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=639.16s)]
*  execution. And in a way, it's kind of misspeaking. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=643.96s)]
*  But I think in a bigger way, it's actually not because there's obviously a great deal [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=646.36s)]
*  of concern about Julian Assange's physical and mental condition. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=650.72s)]
*  The last time I saw him was in 2017 or 2018, shortly before he was taken out of the [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=654.76s)]
*  embassy by the British police when Ecuador was coerced and bullied by Mike Pompeo to [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=662.56s)]
*  withdraw their asylum that allowed the British police to go in. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=668.96s)]
*  And this is before he went into Belmarch prison. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=671.9200000000001s)]
*  And just to give people a sense, Belmarch prison is not a joke. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=675.48s)]
*  The BBC has called it the British Guantanamo. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=678.0400000000001s)]
*  It's a high security prison. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=680.84s)]
*  It's the place where terror suspects and people like that are put. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=682.12s)]
*  He's done now five years of hard time. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=685.44s)]
*  And when I saw him still in the embassy, he was looking, you know, just very fragile, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=687.72s)]
*  very gaunt, very unwell, as you would expect for somebody who hadn't been outside or [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=692.32s)]
*  seen the sunlight in, you know, eight years and was trapped in this tiny little apartment [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=696.9599999999999s)]
*  essentially for all of those years, year after year after year. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=701.7199999999999s)]
*  Assange was not at, as I understand it, the two days of hearings. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=706.0s)]
*  Have you been able to obtain in your time there any information about his physical and [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=709.52s)]
*  mental condition? [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=714.24s)]
*  Yeah, that's correct. He wasn't there. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=716.64s)]
*  I asked someone who did see him recently about three months ago in October. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=718.8399999999999s)]
*  And these are the words that this person used. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=723.12s)]
*  They said that he looks 70, 70 with zero, 70 years old. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=725.6s)]
*  So, you know, I think that's that's quite descriptive. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=730.16s)]
*  The last time I saw him, which was on a video feed because he was he was tuning in from [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=733.16s)]
*  the prison to watch one of the hearings. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=737.28s)]
*  This is about two years ago. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=740.96s)]
*  I didn't even understand that that was him at first. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=743.92s)]
*  Just to give you an idea of how how how shocking, you know. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=746.08s)]
*  And again, I I feel really bad for him. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=750.12s)]
*  He just looked bad. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=753.32s)]
*  And I didn't it took me a minute to understand that that was him because we were getting [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=754.5600000000001s)]
*  our things ready and we're getting ready to report. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=757.16s)]
*  And he really doesn't look well. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=759.16s)]
*  And this is the consequence of this persecution. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=760.84s)]
*  It's not just, you know, a legal case. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=763.96s)]
*  Now, they're really killing him slowly. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=767.08s)]
*  And obviously, when you're sent to the US, if you're sent to the US and you're put [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=768.96s)]
*  under special administrative measures, it's going to be way worse than Belmarsh. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=773.96s)]
*  But that doesn't mean Belmarsh is OK. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=777.48s)]
*  You know, the fact that anyone in England is is number one, given a custodial sentence, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=780.0s)]
*  so they're put in prison for a bail violation is I mean, it's rare. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=784.9200000000001s)]
*  And not to mention in a maximum security prison, which is Belmarsh, which is one [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=789.6400000000001s)]
*  Britain's Guantanamo, as you said. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=794.0400000000001s)]
*  And then on top of that, given 52 weeks, I mean, this is so clear that they want him [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=795.5200000000001s)]
*  to be in prison and they did this on purpose so that the United States can then [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=799.6800000000001s)]
*  unseal this indictment. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=804.1600000000001s)]
*  And I should just remind people that the original indictment had about six counts [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=805.4s)]
*  under the Espionage Act, which is already ludicrous. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=809.76s)]
*  And then after the deadline had already passed, they came out with a superseding [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=812.12s)]
*  indictment with 17 counts. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=816.12s)]
*  So it was all a ploy. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=817.96s)]
*  It was all a trick to get Assange in there, hit him with this indictment and make sure [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=819.08s)]
*  he never leaves. And there are people who were in Belmarsh prison. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=824.48s)]
*  One of them is Abu Qatada. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=828.28s)]
*  He was like a Jordanian suspected member of al-Qaeda. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=829.44s)]
*  And even he was given better treatment out of the same prison and put under house arrest. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=833.0s)]
*  There's no reason Julian Assange, you know, if you're really going to argue, OK, he's [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=838.0400000000001s)]
*  a flight risk, you can put him under house arrest. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=841.36s)]
*  He doesn't have to be in a maximum security prison where you're slowly killing him. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=843.48s)]
*  There's just no argument for this, not to mention the fact that he shouldn't be under [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=847.0s)]
*  house arrest at all. But, you know, it just goes to show you how adamant and insistent [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=850.5600000000001s)]
*  they are on killing him. And I want to point out another thing in the court. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=855.52s)]
*  It had, you know, they discussed the fact that the CIA want to kill him. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=859.36s)]
*  And in the original ruling in 2021, when the extradition was blocked, it was only [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=863.56s)]
*  blocked on health grounds. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=869.04s)]
*  The judge didn't seem to think that this was relevant information, that the CIA want [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=870.4399999999999s)]
*  to kill him. She was saying, well, you know, this is a court case that's still playing [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=874.52s)]
*  out in Spain because the security company contracted by the CIA was in Spain. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=877.8399999999999s)]
*  So, you know, she basically shrugged it aside. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=882.8s)]
*  And then the US lawyers, what they what they did this week is they said, well, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=885.16s)]
*  there's this is not new information. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=888.56s)]
*  The Yahoo News article. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=890.52s)]
*  And I was laughing to myself because in a way the US lawyer was right. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=891.88s)]
*  Her name is Dovin. We already know the CIA was trying to kill Assange in 2020. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=895.64s)]
*  And we didn't need the Yahoo News article, but it is relevant evidence. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=899.68s)]
*  So, you know, it's maybe not fresh evidence, but it's certainly relevant evidence. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=903.1999999999999s)]
*  And the fact that, you know, they want to send Assange to a country that has plotted [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=907.56s)]
*  to kill him is egregious beyond words. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=912.6s)]
*  I mean, any proper court in the world would have already thrown this case out from day [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=914.96s)]
*  one. I don't even know why this has been going on for four years. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=919.5600000000001s)]
*  And, you know, they put on such a show with these these mighty buildings and, you know, [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=922.36s)]
*  royal courts of justice. There's no justice in these courtrooms. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=927.52s)]
*  I guarantee you that, Glenn, it's really a kangaroo court. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=930.0s)]
*  Oh, I know, I know. And, you know, you know what? [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=932.44s)]
*  Honestly, you know, it makes me so sick is, as you know, you're describing so accurately [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=934.0s)]
*  the fact that they're they're murdering Julian in real time, like, you know, in this kind [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=939.76s)]
*  of slow, deliberate way. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=943.64s)]
*  I think it's worth noting and you kind of alluded to it, but just to make it manifest, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=946.64s)]
*  he hasn't been charged with any crimes. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=952.28s)]
*  He's not in prison because he's been convicted of any crimes. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=953.8s)]
*  They originally convicted him of a bail jumping misdemeanor and gave him the maximum [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=956.1999999999999s)]
*  sentence possible under the law, which is 51 weeks, just under a year that he has served [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjVY8dELcq4&t=960.72s)]
