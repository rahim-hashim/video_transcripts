# No, TikTok Is *Not* a Chinese Spy App
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [November 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo)
*  I'd be willing to bet a lot of money that there are a lot of you who believe this, who [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=0.0s)]
*  believe that TikTok is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, that the censorship or content [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=10.76s)]
*  moderation decisions they make are designed to manipulate young American people, young [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=16.8s)]
*  Americans into hating their government and to fighting with one another, just like we [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=21.96s)]
*  were told the Russians do. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=26.48s)]
*  We're constantly told the Russians are trying to infiltrate social media, to turn us against [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=28.439999999999998s)]
*  each other, to create division. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=32.379999999999995s)]
*  That was for a long time the reason more social media censorship was needed to prevent the [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=34.28s)]
*  scary Russians from dividing us. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=40.36s)]
*  Now they've added China to it, knowing that a lot of people aren't afraid of Russia, that [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=42.0s)]
*  the Russiagate hoax proved to be a fraud. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=47.599999999999994s)]
*  They've now switched the fear mongering to China. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=50.36s)]
*  And I know there are a lot of people who oppose the war in Ukraine, the U.S. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=52.28s)]
*  control in the war in Ukraine, who know Russiagate is a fraud, who say no, Russia is not [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=56.72s)]
*  rendering China. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=60.6s)]
*  That's who we really have to be afraid of. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=62.0s)]
*  Now, what happened was I actually did a lot of investigation and research into this because [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=65.64s)]
*  I wrote about it here in December of 2022 when I was still at Substack. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=70.72s)]
*  Reflecting new U.S. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=75.84s)]
*  control of TikTok censorship, our report criticizing Zelensky was deleted. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=77.24s)]
*  What happened was we produced a segment on our show here that was very critical of [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=81.6s)]
*  President Zelensky and of the Ukrainian government and the war effort of the United States [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=88.88s)]
*  in Ukraine. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=93.8s)]
*  And it got went pretty viral. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=94.8s)]
*  A lot of people were spreading it around and watching it. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=96.56s)]
*  And then suddenly, very quickly, it got banned, taken down by TikTok that sent us a note [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=99.39999999999999s)]
*  saying, this video is a violation of our terms of service. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=105.11999999999999s)]
*  And of course, I thought to myself, OK, I kept hearing that China censors to [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=108.28s)]
*  propagandize Americans against their government. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=114.6s)]
*  So why would they want to delete my video critical of the U.S. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=116.47999999999999s)]
*  government? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=120.0s)]
*  Why would they want to protect the U.S. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=121.0s)]
*  government from my criticism of it? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=122.16s)]
*  Why would they want to protect the U.S. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=124.16s)]
*  government's war effort in Ukraine by banning critiques of it? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=125.64s)]
*  That doesn't make any sense, does it? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=130.68s)]
*  Just like it doesn't make sense that TikTok banned mention of the U.S. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=132.12s)]
*  And we went and investigated what actually was going on. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=135.67999999999998s)]
*  And it turns out that what's really going on, I'm going to show you the evidence and [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=139.27999999999997s)]
*  you can make your own decision, is that the CIA and the FBI have taken the position they [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=144.16s)]
*  want TikTok banned. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=149.04s)]
*  The people who own TikTok, who are the founders of TikTok, the main founder in particular, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=153.23999999999998s)]
*  is someone who was born in Singapore. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=159.88s)]
*  He went to the London School of Economics. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=161.72s)]
*  He then went to Harvard Business School. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=164.88s)]
*  He's a capitalist. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=167.23999999999998s)]
*  He's trying to get wealthy. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=168.23999999999998s)]
*  He's getting rich. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=169.72s)]
*  He's the founder of TikTok. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=170.92s)]
*  And the U.S. is an incredibly lucrative market for TikTok that they don't want to lose [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=173.28s)]
*  access to because it would cost them billions of dollars in valuation of their company. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=177.84s)]
*  They're now trying to get into the U.S. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=182.79999999999998s)]
*  market. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=183.95999999999998s)]
*  Because it would cost them billions of dollars in valuation of their company. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=185.68s)]
*  They're now trying to compete with Amazon and have e-commerce on that site. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=189.20000000000002s)]
*  It's a gold mine. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=194.04000000000002s)]
*  And so they're desperate not to get banned from the United States. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=196.68s)]
*  And so they've told the CIA and the FBI, look, we don't care about political censorship. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=200.16s)]
*  We'll turn that over to you. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=204.76000000000002s)]
*  We'll let you tell us what you want censored in order for us to stay in the United States. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=206.20000000000002s)]
*  And that is what's been happening. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=213.24s)]
*  The U.S. security state has been gradually commandeering the ability to content moderate [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=216.56s)]
*  on TikTok as a condition for allowing TikTok to remain in the United States. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=224.16s)]
*  So here is the article we wrote. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=233.28s)]
*  For years, U.S. officials and their media allies accused Russia, China and Iran of tyranny [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=234.48s)]
*  for demanding censorship as a condition for big tech access. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=239.92s)]
*  That's what China and Iran and Russia do. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=242.6s)]
*  They say, hey, Google and Facebook, you can only come in our country if you agree to censor [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=245.16s)]
*  as we command. That's what Brazil is doing as well to Facebook and Google and Twitter. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=249.8s)]
*  We'll let you be in our country, but only if you censor as we demand. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=254.72s)]
*  And Facebook, Google and Twitter want access to the Brazilian market. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=257.8s)]
*  It's a huge market. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=264.12s)]
*  And so they censor as the Brazilian government tells them to. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=266.0s)]
*  Elon Musk had a controversy because right before the Indian election, the Indian government [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=268.48s)]
*  told Twitter, we want all these accounts banned and Elon Musk banned them. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=272.68s)]
*  And when he was criticized over it, he said, well, look, I'm not going to lose access to [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=277.48s)]
*  India, a gigantic democracy. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=281.40000000000003s)]
*  Of course, I'm going to censor as the government tells me to if the threat is if I don't, I'll [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=284.12s)]
*  be banned from their market. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=288.88s)]
*  That's what the United States is doing to TikTok. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=290.6s)]
*  It's telling them we're going to ban you from our country unless you're going to be banned [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=292.28000000000003s)]
*  from the United States. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=297.36s)]
*  You censor the way we want. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=298.36s)]
*  We know that the United States government is very interested in controlling the flow of [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=300.92s)]
*  information on Big Tech. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=304.03999999999996s)]
*  That's what the Twitter files were about. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=305.03999999999996s)]
*  They were doing that with Facebook and Google and Twitter. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=307.03999999999996s)]
*  And of course, they're doing that with TikTok as well. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=309.68s)]
*  And so here's what we wrote. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=313.59999999999997s)]
*  Quote, concerns over China's ability to manipulate US public opinion were based on claims that [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=314.59999999999997s)]
*  China was banning content on TikTok that was contrary to Beijing's interest. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=320.08s)]
*  Western media outlets were specifically alleging that the Chinese government itself was censoring [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=325.76s)]
*  TikTok to ban any content that the CCP regarded as threatening to its national security and [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=329.64s)]
*  internal order. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=335.28000000000003s)]
*  Rather than ban TikTok from the US, the US security state is now doing exactly that which [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=337.04s)]
*  China does to the US, to US tech companies, namely requiring that as a condition to [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=341.28000000000003s)]
*  maintaining access to the American market. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=346.24s)]
*  TikTok must now censor content that undermines what those agencies view, the CIA, the FBI, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=348.08s)]
*  the DHS as undermining American national security interests. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=354.92s)]
*  TikTok, desperate not to lose access to hundreds of millions of Americans, has been making [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=359.56s)]
*  a series of significant concessions to appease the Pentagon, CIA and FBI, the agencies most [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=363.72s)]
*  opposed to deals that allow TikTok to stay in the US. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=370.72s)]
*  Among those concessions is that TikTok is now outsourcing what the US government calls [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=373.12s)]
*  content moderation, a pleasant sounding euphemism for political censorship, to groups [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=379.40000000000003s)]
*  controlled by the US government. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=384.56s)]
*  And this is a report from Reuters, quote, TikTok has already unveiled several measures aimed [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=387.52s)]
*  at appeasing the US government, including an agreement for Oracle Corporation to store [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=392.2s)]
*  the data of the apps users in the United States and a United States Data Security Division, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=397.44s)]
*  part of the US government, to oversee data protection and content moderation decisions. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=403.6s)]
*  It has spent $1.5 billion on hiring and reorganization costs to build up that unit, according to a [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=409.16s)]
*  source familiar with the matter. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=415.16s)]
*  TikTok has been hiring away from Facebook, from Instagram, all their security state executives [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=417.20000000000005s)]
*  who had overseen censorship for Facebook and for Google and putting them in charge of content [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=423.52000000000004s)]
*  moderation and TikTok to show the US government, we're going to censor the way you want, just [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=428.40000000000003s)]
*  like Facebook and Google do as a condition to allowing us access to your market. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=432.40000000000003s)]
*  Keep an open mind on this. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=438.88000000000005s)]
*  Whenever government officials start trying to scare you and then in conjunction with it, say, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=440.92s)]
*  now that we put you in fear of China and what they're doing on TikTok, give us the power to censor [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=446.28000000000003s)]
*  what your kids can and can't hear or what adults can and can't hear. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=450.48s)]
*  Be open minded to what actually is happening, at least. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=454.68s)]
*  It was the White House that first demanded TikTok be banned. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=460.92s)]
*  It was Karine Jopierre, the White House press secretary, who did so in March of this year. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=465.0s)]
*  And when she did, a TikTok user named Luke David Johnson produced a video. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=473.2s)]
*  He's a prominent TikTok user. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=481.04s)]
*  He's not a child. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=483.04s)]
*  He's not a young adult. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=483.92s)]
*  He looks to be in his 30s or 40s. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=484.88s)]
*  He produced a video explaining why it's so dangerous to allow the Biden White House to try [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=487.68s)]
*  and ban TikTok. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=492.96s)]
*  And I'm going to show you this video because he lays out the argument very clearly and very [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=493.92s)]
*  persuasively. And I hope it'll just at least have people keep an open mind. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=500.24s)]
*  The way she casually thumbs through her notebook without even looking at the pages, knowing [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=514.08s)]
*  there's nothing in there that's going to help her with probably the most important question [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=520.0s)]
*  anyone has asked her in weeks. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=524.4799999999999s)]
*  As she tries to act like it's just some run of the mill question. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=527.52s)]
*  Oh, by the way, TikTok. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=531.8399999999999s)]
*  You're the press secretary. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=535.28s)]
*  You're all things media. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=536.64s)]
*  You're obsessed with the media. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=538.0s)]
*  TikTok has a hundred million users that use it for 90 minutes a day. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=539.4399999999999s)]
*  You know this is huge. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=543.8399999999999s)]
*  She tries to play it down like it's practically nothing. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=545.92s)]
*  Should ban TikTok when he was asked about this. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=550.16s)]
*  Now the administration seems to be hardening its stance. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=552.56s)]
*  You're backing this legislation as you mentioned. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=554.7199999999999s)]
*  We've learned now warning that a possible ban could be at risk here. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=557.12s)]
*  The key part of that, like it usually is, what changed? [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=563.4399999999999s)]
*  I'll tell you what changed. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=568.4799999999999s)]
*  TikTok didn't start collecting any kind of data that it wasn't already collecting before. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=570.0799999999999s)]
*  It's also not collecting data that a million other companies don't harvest and sell in [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=574.48s)]
*  nice tight neat little packages to all kinds of people around the world, which are freely available. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=579.84s)]
*  I don't think that China went out of its way to create an app in order to track and monitor [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=586.4s)]
*  stuff that's widely available on the market already. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=591.52s)]
*  Would have been a lot more cost effective for them to just go buy it. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=594.5600000000001s)]
*  But what they did do was give Americans the ability to communicate with each other. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=598.4s)]
*  And what has been happening, as she mentioned, there's a hundred million users now 90 minutes a day. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=603.0400000000001s)]
*  Using this platform to communicate with each other. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=609.44s)]
*  That is a huge threat. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=612.32s)]
*  And not to the Americans, not to the individuals who are communicating their ideas to one another, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=614.32s)]
*  but to the administration in power. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=620.48s)]
*  And that's why this is a bipartisan bill that she's so proud to keep pointing out. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=622.8000000000001s)]
*  It's bipartisan because both parties in power agree that it's dangerous for the American [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=628.08s)]
*  people to communicate their ideas to one another without their control. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=634.4000000000001s)]
*  See, it's fine when it's the mainstream media that they have control over. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=640.1600000000001s)]
*  It's fine when it's Twitter and Facebook and other companies that they have control over. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=643.84s)]
*  But it's not fine when it's a company they don't have control over. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=648.24s)]
*  Twitter was okay before. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=651.7600000000001s)]
*  Now Twitter is a problem because it's no longer controlled by the US government. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=653.12s)]
*  See how this works? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=658.24s)]
*  This is probably the biggest question she's ever been asked in her career. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=659.6800000000001s)]
*  And she has to know it. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=663.44s)]
*  She's a press secretary of the United States of America. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=665.12s)]
*  TikTok is a really big deal. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=670.1600000000001s)]
*  It's way bigger than any conversation they've ever had from that podium about anything. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=672.08s)]
*  So do you see what he's saying? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=679.5200000000001s)]
*  Saying the United States government has worked very hard to make sure it controls [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=682.32s)]
*  all important means of communication. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=688.0s)]
*  It obviously has the US media in the palm of its hands. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=689.6s)]
*  The US media reports what the CIA and the FBI tell it to and doesn't report what they [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=693.36s)]
*  tell it not to say. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=700.48s)]
*  The big tech platforms, Facebook and Google and Twitter before Elon Musk, as we know, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=702.96s)]
*  were subject to constant orders from the government about what to censor and they did it. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=708.96s)]
*  And the reason they're so fixated on Elon Musk and the reason they hate Rumble and any [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=714.8s)]
*  other site that doesn't obey them is because they can't stand the notion that Americans [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=719.6s)]
*  can go on a platform and communicate ideas that they can't stop. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=724.8s)]
*  And this is what the threats to ban TikTok are about, is about trying to have the American [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=730.88s)]
*  government be able to commandeer those censorship decisions so that they can't be [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=736.9599999999999s)]
*  critical videos of Zelensky and the war in Ukraine or topic videos about the Bin Laden [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=744.32s)]
*  letter get censored because the US government wants it to and they can easily get Google [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=750.64s)]
*  and Facebook to censor it. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=754.72s)]
*  It's a little harder with TikTok. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=755.92s)]
*  And TikTok has had to agree more and more because they don't care about political censorship. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=759.04s)]
*  They care about profit. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=764.72s)]
*  These are capitalists. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=765.76s)]
*  They don't care about giving the US government control over content moderation. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=769.28s)]
*  They're happy to do it. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=773.76s)]
*  If that's the condition they have to meet in order to keep access to the very lucrative [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=775.68s)]
*  US market. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=780.3199999999999s)]
*  Here is TikTok constantly reassuring the United States and the US government TikTok's [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=781.92s)]
*  commitment to US national security. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=788.24s)]
*  They are saying here that their commitment is to US national security. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=791.92s)]
*  Put simply, Project Texas, which is the TikTok project to hand over control of data and content [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=798.0s)]
*  moderation to American agencies and companies, is an unprecedented initiative dedicated to [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=805.4399999999999s)]
*  making every American on TikTok feel safe with confidence their data is secure and the [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=811.4399999999999s)]
*  platform is free from outside influence. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=815.8399999999999s)]
*  This is the thing about this idea that the Chinese are spying on us with TikTok. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=817.68s)]
*  As Luke Johnson said, leaving aside how much Facebook and Google spy on us, how much data [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=822.8s)]
*  they have about you and me and everybody, we covered before about how the CIA and the [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=827.92s)]
*  FBI buy on the open market enormous amounts of data about Americans that are for sale, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=835.8399999999999s)]
*  that have been bundled, that they would be prohibited constitutionally from collecting [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=840.9599999999999s)]
*  on their own, but they buy it commercially instead. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=847.1999999999999s)]
*  And if the goal of the Chinese government was to spy on Americans and gather data about [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=849.36s)]
*  Americans, it would be much more cost effective to just go buy it on the open market rather than [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=854.0s)]
*  having to create this whole entire app and attract Americans to use it. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=859.44s)]
*  But the condition for TikTok to remain in America has been to hand over control of content [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=864.96s)]
*  moderation decisions and data to the US government and that's exactly what they're doing. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=869.04s)]
*  Here's more from TikTok. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=875.6s)]
*  They're doing, here's more from TikTok, our content moderation systems and processes, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=877.52s)]
*  both machine and human, will always be subject to outside review to ensure that moderation is [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=882.48s)]
*  taking place only in accordance with our published community guidelines. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=887.8399999999999s)]
*  The USDS will implement these rules and the TTP, American-based trusted technology provider, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=891.8399999999999s)]
*  will have full visibility guaranteeing that there are no expected changes to our system. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=899.68s)]
*  So all promotional decisions will be as transparent and audible to the third-party monitors and US [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=904.9599999999999s)]
*  Content Advisory Council. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=910.0s)]
*  Here is Bloomberg or rather Reuters in June of 2023. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=913.1999999999999s)]
*  I'm sorry, yeah, it was Bloomberg in May of 2023. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=922.64s)]
*  TikTok will soon grant Oracle full access to their code and algorithm. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=926.8s)]
*  TikTok will soon grant Oracle Corporation full access to its source code, algorithm, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=931.28s)]
*  and content moderation material as part of efforts to alleviate national security concerns [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=935.6s)]
*  about the app. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=939.6s)]
*  Here from Reuters, TikTok moves US users' data to Oracle servers. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=940.56s)]
*  TikTok had previously been storing its US user data at its own data centers in Virginia with [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=945.52s)]
*  a backup in Singapore. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=950.24s)]
*  It will now delete private data on US users from its own data centers and rely fully on [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=951.92s)]
*  Oracle's US servers, it says. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=956.8s)]
*  TikTok has also set up a dedicated US data security team known as USDS as a gatekeeper [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=958.8s)]
*  for US user information and ring-fencing it from ByteDance, a company spokesman told Reuters. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=963.76s)]
*  Now, I understand that if you are just somebody who thinks China is the only threat, the biggest [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=971.12s)]
*  threat, even bigger than Hamas, you're not going to be able to do anything about it. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=978.7199999999999s)]
*  China is the biggest threat, even bigger than Hamas, and everything connected to China, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=985.12s)]
*  where China has mentioned you get very scared and you're ready to give the government all [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=992.64s)]
*  power. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=995.92s)]
*  I know this all seems, with TikTok saying, oh, they're going to hand over content moderation [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=996.56s)]
*  decisions to the US security state, oh, I don't believe China. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=1000.88s)]
*  China will say anything to get access to us. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=1003.8399999999999s)]
*  But again, there's 100 million Americans, 100 million Americans, one out of every three [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=1006.24s)]
*  Americans that use this app voluntarily. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=1011.68s)]
*  And the proof that TikTok is actually making decisions to censor in accordance with what [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=1017.28s)]
*  the US government wants is very clear. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=1025.44s)]
*  We just showed you some. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=1027.04s)]
*  Dave Smith, who I think is one of the smartest commentators around Joe Rogan's program last [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=1029.6799999999998s)]
*  week to talk about the Israel-Gaza war. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=1036.0s)]
*  And he brought up the controversy with the bin Laden letter. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=1040.32s)]
*  And watch this, what happened here. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=1045.92s)]
*  In the same way, you know, like the other week that Osama bin Laden's letter to America [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=1047.6s)]
*  went like super viral on TikTok, and then they scrubbed it off of the Guardian as a [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=1052.0s)]
*  response to it, which is just number one, like, what is that? [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=1056.48s)]
*  Doesn't that just say everything about our society? [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=1059.52s)]
*  Is that that's the response to scrub it off the Guardian? [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=1062.0s)]
*  Take it down so people can't see it. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=1066.08s)]
*  The Guardian being the newspaper covered it? [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=1068.16s)]
*  Yeah, they had published it and it had been up there, I think, since. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=1070.32s)]
*  And what were they they were concerned that it was encouraging people to support it? [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=1074.72s)]
*  Yeah, like a bunch of a bunch of TikTokers, like young lefty TikTokers started like making [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=1078.32s)]
*  these videos where they're like Osama bin Laden was right about everything. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=1082.96s)]
*  And then they were getting heat for it. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=1086.4s)]
*  So they just took it down. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=1087.68s)]
*  I mean, you can still find it like on the archives. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=1088.72s)]
*  And so it's still a lot of people's videos are still up, right? [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=1090.48s)]
*  It's a lot. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=1093.52s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=1094.08s)]
*  I don't know about that. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=1094.72s)]
*  I'm not on TikTok. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=1095.6s)]
*  I kind of just saw on Twitter when people were sharing the TikTok videos. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=1096.48s)]
*  So I don't know if they were taking them down. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=1099.84s)]
*  I know TikTok takes down stuff pretty quickly. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=1101.36s)]
*  But I don't know. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=1104.08s)]
*  I don't know what they were doing with with that. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=1104.7199999999998s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=1106.7199999999998s)]
*  Why would they take that down, though? [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=1107.12s)]
*  If I was a Chinese run propaganda corporation, TikTok removes hashtag for Osama bin Laden's [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=1108.48s)]
*  letter to America after viral video circulate. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=1115.52s)]
*  So they just removed the hashtag. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=1118.0s)]
*  The Guardian also pulled the text of the Al Qaeda founder. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=1119.9199999999998s)]
*  Do you see what just happened there? [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=1123.12s)]
*  Joe Rogan had been hearing and got convinced that TikTok is this propaganda weapon of the [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=1126.1599999999999s)]
*  Chinese Communist Party. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=1130.8799999999999s)]
*  They use it to disseminate information that corrupts Americans. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=1132.24s)]
*  And he's like, why would TikTok possibly ever ban the Osama bin Laden letter from being [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=1136.8799999999999s)]
*  discussed? [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=1142.1599999999999s)]
*  They must love the Osama bin Laden letter. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=1142.48s)]
*  It turns Americans against each other. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=1144.24s)]
*  They would never ban it. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=1145.9199999999998s)]
*  And then suddenly appears on the screen a news story that says TikTok banned the hashtag [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=1146.8799999999999s)]
*  to the bin Laden letter, which prevents people from seeing it. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=1152.9599999999998s)]
*  Joe Rogan said, oh, I guess they did. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=1155.28s)]
*  And then he tried to kind of minimize it and say, oh, they only ban the hashtag. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=1157.2s)]
*  Banning the hashtag is a huge deal because that's how people search for it. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=1161.36s)]
*  And then they can't find it. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=1164.6399999999999s)]
*  But they went much further than that TikTok did. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=1167.52s)]
*  But you see Joe Rogan in his mind has been told so many times or absorbed. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=1169.44s)]
*  Oh, there's a Chinese Communist Party site. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=1173.04s)]
*  They're not going to ban the bin Laden letter. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=1175.2s)]
*  They would spread that. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=1178.48s)]
*  They would love that. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=1179.6s)]
*  But they did ban it. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=1180.8s)]
*  And the United States security state is gaining more and more control over what appears on TikTok and what doesn't. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=1181.92s)]
*  You can also find full episodes the morning after they air across all major podcasting platforms, including Spotify and Apple. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=1212.88s)]
*  All the information you need is linked below. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=1219.68s)]
*  We hope to see you there. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geJoiV5lHBo&t=1221.68s)]
