# Collapsing Apartment Buildings in Yemen: Wise and Just?
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [March 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0)
*  There was a segment of these chats that were about the bombing campaign itself that happened [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=0.0s)]
*  not before the bombing campaign but as the first strikes happened. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=16.88s)]
*  At 1.48 p.m. Mike Waltz sent the following text containing real-time intelligence about [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=20.6s)]
*  conditions at an attack site, apparently in Sanaa. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=25.28s)]
*  He said VP building collapse had multiple positive ID and it was unclear what he was [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=29.84s)]
*  referring to. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=34.88s)]
*  He said the Atlantic article says Mike Waltz was referring here to Hegseth. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=35.88s)]
*  General Michael Corilla, the commander of Central Command in the intelligence community [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=39.6s)]
*  or IC. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=44.64s)]
*  But JD Vance didn't understand the message from Waltz. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=46.56s)]
*  It was just written in a very incoherent way. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=52.84s)]
*  So JD Vance said, what? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=55.6s)]
*  And then Mike Waltz responded this way. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=57.24s)]
*  Sorry, typing too fast. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=60.04s)]
*  The first target, their top missile guy, we had positive ID of him walking into his girlfriend's [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=61.68s)]
*  building and now it's collapsed. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=67.88s)]
*  And then after that JD Vance responded a minute later, excellent. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=76.12s)]
*  And then 35 minutes after that Ratcliffe, the CIA director wrote, a good start. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=82.48s)]
*  And then Waltz followed with a series of emojis, an American flag emoji, a fist emoji, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=86.84s)]
*  and a fire emoji. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=91.88000000000001s)]
*  So I just want to highlight this, that this is what the Emin bombing campaign entailed [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=92.88000000000001s)]
*  to start off. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=96.72s)]
*  They identified someone that they claim was a top missile person for the Houthis. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=98.26s)]
*  They didn't kill him in his car, they didn't kill him on a battlefield. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=103.60000000000001s)]
*  They waited for him to enter a residential building filled with civilians, including [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=107.04s)]
*  his girlfriend. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=112.30000000000001s)]
*  And the way they killed him was by collapsing the entire building. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=114.6s)]
*  And that first day there were many claims of civilian deaths. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=119.88s)]
*  And unsurprisingly, given that these were the rules of engagement. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=123.44s)]
*  Is that something that you think is a legitimate military strategy? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=128.48s)]
*  To find somebody that is, in your view, a legitimate target and just blowing up whatever [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=134.04s)]
*  building they're in, regardless of how many civilians you kill? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=141.4s)]
*  If during the Iraq war, the Iraqis had identified where a military commander lived, and he lived [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=146.12s)]
*  in some 47-foot, 47-floor high-rise apartment in Chicago, would he have had the, would the [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=150.28s)]
*  Iraqis have had the right to just blow up the entire building and said, well, there [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=157.8s)]
*  was one guy in there who was a legitimate target? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=160.52s)]
*  Or what if the Yemenis or the Palestinians blow up a building now in which there was [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=164.64s)]
*  located some kind of military commander? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=173.04s)]
*  And they blow up a building in Washington, or they blow up an apartment building in New [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=177.72s)]
*  York, and their excuse was, well, there was one guy in there who was a military commander [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=180.55999999999997s)]
*  and a legitimate, we would instantly call that terrorism. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=184.32s)]
*  We would say, oh, that's an act of terrorism. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=187.88s)]
*  You blow up an apartment building and you kill 37 American civilians along with one [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=190.96s)]
*  member of the military. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=195.92000000000002s)]
*  But of course, when we do it, it's not terrorism. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=199.04000000000002s)]
*  Somehow it becomes legitimate. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=200.88s)]
*  But if that's what this bombing campaign is, collapsing residential buildings in order [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=202.32s)]
*  to take out some mid-level missile person or their top missile person even, who will [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=208.44s)]
*  just get replaced very easily. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=213.12s)]
*  It's happened throughout the entire world on terror. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=215.24s)]
*  We were told so many times, hey, we got the number three person of al-Qaeda. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=216.98s)]
*  Everyone cheered. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=220.17999999999998s)]
*  And then like a year later, they're like, hey, we got the number three person of al-Qaeda [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=221.17999999999998s)]
*  again because they just kept getting replenished. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=224.73999999999998s)]
*  That's how the war on terror went on and on. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=227.54s)]
*  This is the kind of endless war posture that Trump said he wanted to avoid. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=228.98s)]
*  Remember, Trump criticized Joe Biden for bombing Yemen. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=232.89999999999998s)]
*  Last year, Biden's argument was they're bombing Israel and they're attacking our ships. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=237.22s)]
*  And Trump said bombing Yemen is totally unnecessary. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=241.01999999999998s)]
*  He should pick up the phone and use diplomacy to resolve it. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=242.94s)]
*  And now not only is Trump doing exactly what Joe Biden did, bombing Yemen, and what Barack [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=248.04s)]
*  Obama did as well when he worked with the Saudis for a full-on war with Houthi, just [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=252.06s)]
*  endless war in the Middle East, but he's loosened the rules of engagement apparently, so that [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=256.3s)]
*  the military is free to blow up entire residential apartment buildings as long as one person [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=261.94s)]
*  that they want to kill is in there not caring in the slightest about how many civilians [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=268.26s)]
*  or children or whoever happens to be, unfortunately, have the misfortune of being in that apartment [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=272.66s)]
*  building when it's quote unquote collapse, how many people are killed with it. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=277.58000000000004s)]
*  So there's a lot going on in this story, most of it quite ugly and unnecessary and eroding [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=283.42s)]
*  of credibility for absolutely no reason. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=290.38s)]
*  But the most significant part by far is the fact that we now have another war in the Middle [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=293.88s)]
*  East that is going to be ongoing, that's not going to stop. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=299.4s)]
*  And just to remind you, the Houthis were actually attacking US ships when Biden was bombing [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=304.23999999999995s)]
*  them and when Trump said that bombing campaign was unnecessary. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=308.67999999999995s)]
*  Once there was a ceasefire in Gaza that Trump and his envoy were able to facilitate, the [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=313.35999999999996s)]
*  Houthis stopped attacking ships and said, now that there's a ceasefire, we don't need [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=323.52s)]
*  to attack ships anymore. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=327.0s)]
*  And they only restarted attacking ships once in their view and everyone in the international [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=329.6s)]
*  community agrees that this happened, once the Israelis started blocking the humanitarian [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=335.8s)]
*  aid that the ceasefire called for, food, medicine, water into Gaza and they said because Israel [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=340.24s)]
*  is abiding by the ceasefire agreement, we're only going to attack Israel flagged or Israel [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=347.76s)]
*  owned ships. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=352.64s)]
*  They're not even attacking American ships anymore, just Israel's. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=353.84s)]
*  And that is what prompted Trump, after saying last year that he opposed it, to restart Biden's [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=358.47999999999996s)]
*  war and to escalate it and clearly killing a ton of civilians as usual. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=365.36s)]
*  And then at some point, we'll be attacked and everybody will walk around saying, oh [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=370.36s)]
*  my God, what did we do? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=373.15999999999997s)]
*  Why did they hate us? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=374.4s)]
*  And I think that has to be the focus once this question of how Jeffrey Goldberg, I have [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=378.2s)]
*  to the chat, is resolved and we can move on from that. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=383.52s)]
*  This is what our focus ought to be. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZmAu9gYZl0&t=385.84s)]
