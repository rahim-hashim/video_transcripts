# Biden Spurns Congress to Illegally Arm Israel & Escalate Red Sea Involvement
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [January 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM)
*  So while the United States under President Biden continues to very steadfastly support [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=0.0s)]
*  the Israeli government in essentially everything it's doing in Gaza, and not only just support [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=13.88s)]
*  them rhetorically, I mean the United States is paying for this war. Every year the United [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=17.92s)]
*  States transfers four billion dollars to Israel under a deal that President Obama and Vice [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=23.0s)]
*  President Biden negotiated with Prime Minister Netanyahu in 2016, a record-breaking deal for [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=28.04s)]
*  the United States to give Israel $3.8 billion every year. For 10 years it was a $38 billion package. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=32.839999999999996s)]
*  But then every time Israel has a new war like it does now, the United States separately pays for [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=40.6s)]
*  that as well, which is why the Biden administration requested $14 billion additional in aid to give [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=45.8s)]
*  to Israel. And in addition to that money, the Biden administration has been feeding Israel the [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=52.16s)]
*  weapons. So if some bomb detonates in Gaza or some ordinance is dropped, then people can see it says [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=61.67999999999999s)]
*  made in America, it's an American weapon. Everyone in the region knows that even though it's nominally [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=69.84s)]
*  an Israeli war, it's the United States that is funding and paying for it and providing the [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=74.47999999999999s)]
*  weapons used to destroy civilian infrastructure and kill huge numbers of people in Gaza. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=78.64s)]
*  And aside from the morality of that policy and the geostrategic wisdom of it, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=85.68s)]
*  it's also illegal because the Biden administration is doing this with no approval from Congress. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=91.12s)]
*  Here is CBS News on December 29th. The Biden administration approves emergency weapon sales [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=97.36s)]
*  to Israel, bypassing Congress. Quote, for the second time this month, the Biden administration [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=103.68s)]
*  is bypassing Congress to approve an emergency weapon sale to Israel as Israel continues to [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=108.80000000000001s)]
*  execute its war against Hamas and Gaza under increasing international criticism. The State [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=114.64000000000001s)]
*  Department said Friday that Secretary of State Antony Blinken informed Congress that he had made [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=120.16000000000001s)]
*  a second emergency determination covering a $147.5 million sale for equipment, including fuses, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=124.16000000000001s)]
*  charges, and primers that is needed to make the 155 millimeter shells that Israel has already [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=132.48s)]
*  purchased function. Blinken made a similar decision on October 9th to approve the sale [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=138.0s)]
*  to Israel of nearly 14,000 rounds of tank ammunition worth more than $106 million. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=142.79999999999998s)]
*  Even some Democratic senators are a little bit upset with this. Here is the Vermont Senator [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=150.79999999999998s)]
*  Peter Welch on January 1st. Quote, for the second time in a matter of weeks, the Secretary of State [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=157.04s)]
*  has approved the sale of tens of thousands of rounds of artillery ammunition to Israel [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=163.04s)]
*  by circumventing Congress's right of prior review. This type of heavy ammunition has been used to [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=167.92s)]
*  devastating effect in Gaza, contributing to the death and injury of countless civilians and the [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=173.92s)]
*  displacement of an estimated two million people who are facing daily bombardment without access [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=178.95999999999998s)]
*  to adequate food, shelter, or medical care. Congress must discuss the merits of supporting [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=184.48s)]
*  the transfer of lethal aid, which is grave implications not only for the millions of [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=189.76s)]
*  civilians trapped in Gaza who had no part in the horrific slaughter of innocent Israelis on [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=193.92s)]
*  October 7th by Hamas, but also for the United States. There are actually major consequences [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=198.32s)]
*  for the United States in supporting and arming and funding Israel. Major costs. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=205.2s)]
*  And that's the reason the Constitution requires congressional approval before the United States [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=211.44s)]
*  can get involved in a war, and that's the reason why there are legal schemes requiring congressional [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=216.16s)]
*  approval before the United States can sell lethal weapons to a foreign country as part of a war. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=220.64s)]
*  And the Biden administration is completely ignoring that law. Now again, I know it's very hard when [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=226.79999999999998s)]
*  people get excited about a war, the way a lot of people have been excited about this war in Israel, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=233.68s)]
*  to get people to care about legalities. It seems very besides the point. It seems very boring. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=238.24s)]
*  But even if you're in favor of this war, you should be very concerned that the Biden [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=247.12s)]
*  administration is simply ignoring the law in sending arms to Israel without any involvement by [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=254.08s)]
*  your representatives in Congress, the people you've theoretically elected to be your voice [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=261.52s)]
*  in making decisions about peace, war and peace. Just the Biden White House is saying, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=267.36s)]
*  we don't care. We're going to do this anyway. It's not just that that they're doing, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=272.24s)]
*  but they have also involved the United States in combat in the Red Sea because the Yemenis, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=278.08s)]
*  the country that the United States worked with the Saudis to bomb for many years under President [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=287.12s)]
*  Obama, has been the Houthis in particular, the militia group in Yemen that was formed to fight [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=291.44s)]
*  against the U.S. puppet regime installed in Yemen that had no popular support and is a very well [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=299.52s)]
*  trained militia. They have been targeting Israeli ships and other ships passing through the Red Sea [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=305.6s)]
*  that they perceive to have some connection to the destruction of Gaza. And even though the United [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=312.64s)]
*  States is not claiming they're acting in response to attacks from the United States, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=319.6s)]
*  at least on a couple of occasions, the Biden administration has deployed military force again [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=325.28000000000003s)]
*  without congressional approval. Now again, maybe you think it's the right thing to do to get [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=329.36s)]
*  involved in another war with Yemen. Even while the risk of escalation is very great, the Israelis [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=333.12s)]
*  bombed Syria several times in the last several weeks. They seem to have carried out an assassination [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=339.36s)]
*  in Lebanon in a way that Hezbollah has said is a red line violation because it's in Beirut. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=346.4s)]
*  There was a huge terrorist attack today in Iran that killed over 100 people. The Israelis deny [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=354.71999999999997s)]
*  involvement. No one knows who for sure did it yet, but obviously that contributes to the tension [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=362.64s)]
*  in this region. If we're going to have an escalation of this war beyond what the United States is [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=367.28s)]
*  already feeling in funding, you should at least demand that the Biden White House has to go to [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=372.08s)]
*  Congress to do it. And yet they're also refusing to do that. Here from the New York Times, December [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=377.91999999999996s)]
*  31st, U.S. helicopters sink three Houthi boats in the Red Sea, the Pentagon says. Quote, Iranian [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=381.68s)]
*  backed Houthi gunmen from Yemen had fired on American helicopters responding to an attack on [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=388.64s)]
*  a commercial ship, American officials said. The Houthis had launched an attack on the freighter, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=393.59999999999997s)]
*  a Singaporean flagged container ship, and were attempting to board it as the ship's security [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=399.12s)]
*  forces tried to hold the attackers at bay. Helicopters from the USS Eisenhower carrier [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=404.08s)]
*  group arrived to chase them away and the Houthis opened fire on them. Quote, the American enemy [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=409.2s)]
*  bears the consequences of this crime, they said in a statement, and its military movement to the [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=414.32s)]
*  Red Sea to protect Israeli ships won't prevent the Houthis from, quote, performing their religious, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=418.71999999999997s)]
*  moral, and humanitarian duty and support and aid of those who have been wronged in Palestine and [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=423.6s)]
*  Gaza. The incident now poses a difficult choice for Mr. Biden and his administration. Senior [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=428.0s)]
*  officials said they must decide whether to strike Houthi missile and drone strikes and sights in [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=432.48s)]
*  Yemen or wait to see whether the Houthis back off after the sinking of three of their fast boats [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=438.24s)]
*  and the death of their fighters. Now note there they weren't acting in defense of a U.S. ship. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=442.88s)]
*  So there's no justification that while we use military force immediately in order to protect an [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=450.48s)]
*  American ship or to avenge the attack on American ships, it was a Singapore flagged ship. And again, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=455.76s)]
*  the legalities matter. The Constitution assigns to Congress the right to declare war, not the [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=462.24s)]
*  president to just go in, involve the U.S. in a bunch of wars without any debate or approval from [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=466.48s)]
*  Congress. Here is just foreign policy, the foreign policy group that actually does among the best [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=471.44s)]
*  work in insisting on some congressional accountability for every time the executive [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=478.0s)]
*  branch decides to just use the military like it's a toy, like they're playing risk. Quote, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=485.44s)]
*  the Singapore flagged ship is not a U.S. quote territorial possession. If there's a strong case [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=491.28s)]
*  that the U.S. should participate in hostilities to protect foreign ships, the administration should [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=498.0s)]
*  simply get authorization from Congress which could help define the mission and avoid mission creep. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=503.03999999999996s)]
*  That is one of the major reasons why you want Congress involved so that the administration [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=510.23999999999995s)]
*  can't just go off with no plan and involve the United States in some new endless war. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=517.1999999999999s)]
*  How many wars are we supposed to be involved in? With that war in Ukraine, I know no one talks [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=522.3199999999999s)]
*  about anymore, it's still ongoing. The Congress has not yet authorized the new $60 billion that [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=526.48s)]
*  the Biden administration has asked for, but that war is still ongoing. The United States is still [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=533.04s)]
*  supplying weapons, so is Europe. You have the war in Israel that I really believe once there's more [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=538.88s)]
*  emotional distance between us and the October 7th attack and the definitive evidence of [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=546.16s)]
*  the definitive evidence of how much of civilian life and civilian infrastructure has been [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=554.32s)]
*  destroyed, how many people end up dying, not just from bombs and shells but from disease and [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=559.92s)]
*  starvation. People are going to be very ashamed, not everybody, but a lot of people are going to [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=565.76s)]
*  be very ashamed to have supported this and they will pretend that they opposed it from the start. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=572.24s)]
*  But to now involve the United States in still another conflict involving Yemen and the Houthis [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=576.96s)]
*  in the Red Sea that could easily lead to escalation with Iran is at least a complex decision that we [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=584.24s)]
*  ought to be having a public debate over through our elected representatives in Congress and yet [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=592.64s)]
*  the Biden administration just doesn't care about the legalities of this war. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUc7tzVVcdM&t=596.88s)]
