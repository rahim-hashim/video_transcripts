# Michael Tracey Presses Lawmakers in Debate Spin Room on Dick Cheney, Israel, and More
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [September 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w)
*  All right. Here we are. Philadelphia. The debate is happening tonight. We are in, I [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=0.0s)]
*  don't know, some little side center that they shunt the media into to keep us all placated [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=17.52s)]
*  running around like little lemmings. I'll try to avoid getting too immersed in the media [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=25.8s)]
*  pack mentality. One funny thing about these debates is that there's tons of foreign media, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=32.52s)]
*  conventions too, and they really have no clue what they're doing. No offense to them, nor [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=38.0s)]
*  should they. I mean, if I went to Australia, there's an Australian lady doing some kind [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=42.92s)]
*  of social media video right near us right now. Get her. Good look at her. She seems [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=45.84s)]
*  fine. She might be from New Zealand. I don't know. Sounds Australian to me. But like, I mean, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=50.2s)]
*  if I were covering Australian politics, unless I did a really deep research dive, I'd be kind of [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=56.2s)]
*  out of my element as well. And yeah, here they are. And so we just bore witness to a giant mob [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=61.800000000000004s)]
*  of journalists that surrounded Anthony Scaramucci, who was press secretary for Trump for like, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  what was it, 12 days in 2017. And he's the big Kamala Harris surrogate now. And he was being [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=76.68s)]
*  swarmed by journalists as though he were the king of England, maybe even above the king of England, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=85.48s)]
*  because he's a Republican who has denounced Trump. And so there's not really a whole lot to do right [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=90.2s)]
*  now, other than just kind of mosey around looking like we're doing something important, which we're [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=99.52000000000001s)]
*  not. So I figured I would just do this little intro video because, you know, you might want to [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=104.68s)]
*  get a little bit of a behind the scenes peek at where the media have been relegated to. And even [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=111.60000000000001s)]
*  identifying as media I have some reservations about. So here you see like, I guess this is ABC [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=119.96000000000001s)]
*  with their setup and maybe CNN or all the people who can afford to spend, I don't know, like $10 [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=125.64000000000001s)]
*  million or something on having their dopey little remote studio setup. And then if you want to pay [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=131.92s)]
*  just like, I don't know, $1 million or something, you can get one of these smaller little setups. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=138.56s)]
*  We are we are not well endowed enough financially to afford one of these. But then again, do we [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=144.67999999999998s)]
*  really want them? I mean, I don't see the added journalistic benefit. Oh, there's Scaramucci. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=151.6s)]
*  Looking looking very important. Looks like he's a hot commodity. We could probably interview him. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=158.36s)]
*  I mean, he's being ushered around like he's a star of the show. It was embarrassing. I mean, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=171.4s)]
*  I felt like I felt like I would be disgracing myself and you the viewer if I joined that massive [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=180.36s)]
*  scrub of reporters that encircled him as though they were hanging on his every word. Yeah, so [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=184.12s)]
*  most of what the journalists are doing here, I mean, we heard over her one NPR reporter saying, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=194.28s)]
*  excuse me, I have to do my I'm gonna be on air in a minute. We had to like move from her table. And [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=198.64000000000001s)]
*  her report was like, we are here in Philadelphia, which as you might know, is the capital of [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=202.68s)]
*  Pennsylvania, a key swing state. And that's the big NPR report. And they just like recite the most [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=211.32s)]
*  banal conventional wisdom imaginable about expectations for the debate. What does Kamala [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=219.16s)]
*  Harris have to do? What does Donald Trump have to do? We all for our familiar with Donald Trump, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=224.84s)]
*  but we're maybe not quite as familiar with Kamala Harris. Therefore, what did they each respectively [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=230.16s)]
*  have to do? So what do I have to do? That's a better question. Maybe I don't know. I guess [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=234.16000000000003s)]
*  we'll hang around here for the next several hours. And we'll maybe do a little bit of trolling, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=243.60000000000002s)]
*  have a little bit of fun, have some laughs, have some tears. And then once the the surrogates are [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=249.68s)]
*  funneled into this spin room, so I guess you can demarcate the spin room versus the media [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=259.32s)]
*  filing center based on the color of the carpeting. That's my understanding. A lot of really intense [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=266.48s)]
*  logistics went into that. They're c spanning, they're the only ones who I don't resent. I [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=272.2s)]
*  actually genuinely do appreciate c span. So I even got a c span t shirt and sweatshirt recently, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=278.76s)]
*  partly because I wanted the t shirt and sweatshirt, but also because I wanted to just contribute to [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=286.44s)]
*  c span because I use tons of their content without compensating them. So there's your little, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=291.6s)]
*  I guess, civic good, you know, civic responsibility note. And yeah, they're just were overrun with [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=298.12s)]
*  journalists who are just staring at the computers doing who God knows what. They could be home, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=305.88s)]
*  I guess, instead of here. But you have to be here because that makes you a serious journalist [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=312.04s)]
*  or something, right? I don't know. You tell me. So what does Kamala Harris have to do? What are [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=318.92s)]
*  you expecting? What does Donald Trump have to do? What are you expecting for his performance? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=327.68s)]
*  That's the those are the utterly forgettable questions, which will be repeated over and over [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=332.64000000000004s)]
*  again today. And we'll have no lasting news value or informational value whatsoever. So that's the [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=339.40000000000003s)]
*  fate that we've been to set with all for your edification. And for my eternal dismay. And yeah, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=346.56s)]
*  ABC News. These are the first debates. I mean, this actually is somewhat notable. These are the [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=357.44s)]
*  first debates, meaning tonight's debate hosted by ABC News than the one in June, hosted by CNN, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=363.16s)]
*  which led to Biden being unceremoniously dumped from the nomination that had been organized not [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=368.72s)]
*  by the Commission on presidential debates, which for decades had been the interim intermediary [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=379.84000000000003s)]
*  between the media organizations and the campaigns to host debates, but by the actual media company [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=384.8s)]
*  itself, in this case, ABC News, and then the two respective campaigns. So I don't know, I mean, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=391.12s)]
*  people talk about how corporate media is like on the decline. I don't really get the sense that [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=397.04s)]
*  that's true based on the dominance that corporate media has asserted over the debates this cycle. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=403.64000000000004s)]
*  So yeah, there you go. Oh, and there's Byron Donalds. Maybe we'll go chat with him. All right, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=408.16s)]
*  that's it for now. Sorry. Goodbye. So in April, you voted for the national security [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=419.8s)]
*  supplemental bill, including the Israel funding component. Obviously, the Biden-Harris administration [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=429.4s)]
*  strongly promoted that. There are people on the left or progressives who wanted to see a shift [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=434.12s)]
*  in Israel policy. Some even had aspirations that maybe Kamala Harris would break some degree with [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=440.4s)]
*  Biden on the status quo. But she, in her first interview a week or two ago, said that there [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=445.72s)]
*  would be no difference whatsoever between her policy approach to the Israel Gaza war and that [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=449.96000000000004s)]
*  of Joe Biden. Are there people who might be deflated to hear that within your coalition, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=454.52000000000004s)]
*  or what do you make of that dynamic? Look, I think what's important is, I think first, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=460.8s)]
*  the vice president has been really clear about her position, which is she has been working with [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=464.12s)]
*  the president for a ceasefire and release of hostages. That has been consistent with the [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=467.44000000000005s)]
*  president's position, the White House, this entire time, and she's been consistent in that as well. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=472.2s)]
*  But what I will also say is, if you have listened to any of her speeches, the way that she has met [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=475.88s)]
*  with activists and advocates and folks that are involved in this issue on the ground, I think she's [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=481.92s)]
*  also showing an important willingness to listen, to uplift those voices. And I know that she is [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=487.52s)]
*  doing everything she can every day to ensure that this war ends. And she, knowing her the kind of [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=493.64s)]
*  person she is, I know that what's happening over there is impacting her like it's impacting all of [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=499.28s)]
*  us. It's horrific. And she wants it to end. But as much as she might listen, that doesn't necessarily [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=503.59999999999997s)]
*  correlate to a policy difference, right? Which is what the advocates are calling for. And that she [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=507.47999999999996s)]
*  wouldn't even allow her, the DNC didn't even allow a Palestinian American to speak at the [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=512.68s)]
*  convention. Well, let's be really clear. Her policy position is aligned with the president. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=515.74s)]
*  That's absolutely correct. But let's talk about Donald Trump. You have someone that actually [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=520.3199999999999s)]
*  called for a Muslim ban. You have somebody who's who's who his allies are talking about building [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=523.24s)]
*  real estate in Gaza. You have somebody who has disrespected Muslims in the Arab community, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=529.12s)]
*  who has basically said and told Netanyahu in publicly that he can do whatever he wants, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=533.4s)]
*  he let him do whatever he wants. So the difference is very clear. I understand that there are going [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=537.6800000000001s)]
*  to be people with differences. I get that. But there is no there is no reason why anyone that [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=543.48s)]
*  honestly believes in this war to end shouldn't be voting for Kamala Harris. Donald Trump is [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=550.24s)]
*  going to allow Netanyahu quite frankly, to do whatever the hell he will. Well, there are plenty [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=553.72s)]
*  of Trump surrogates around here. So I'll be sure to ask them about Trump's policy. I want to hear [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=557.5600000000001s)]
*  about Kamala Harris's policy from you, though, since you're a co-chair of her campaign. She has [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=561.28s)]
*  said that she has indicated it's hard to really get that clear of a statement of policy from her, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=567.32s)]
*  but she's indicated that she would not rescind any of the weapons shipments that have been going to [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=571.08s)]
*  Israel. So can we just expect the status quo to be perpetuated where however much she listens to [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=575.16s)]
*  activists or however much she claims that she wants to see the war end, if you're still supplying [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=582.12s)]
*  endless armaments to Netanyahu's government in Israel, then the war presumably is not going to [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=587.56s)]
*  end, correct? Look, I think two things. I think one is, you know, in speaking for the campaign, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=593.36s)]
*  I think that her position has been clear. She wants an end of the war, a ceasefire, and it wants [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=598.0s)]
*  to ensure the hostages are released. What about the weapons shipments? Well, her position has been [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=603.56s)]
*  the same as the president's. I think she's been clear about that. And so, you know, she will [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=607.0s)]
*  announce her policy positions as it relates, though, to voting in this election. And I think [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=610.56s)]
*  you hear this, and I hear this, by the way, from activists on the ground, from folks and from folks [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=615.64s)]
*  in the community, there is a clear difference between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump on this [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=619.3599999999999s)]
*  issue. And so what's the difference really? I mean, the Biden administration has sent more armaments [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=623.4799999999999s)]
*  to Israel than any administration ever. A huge difference. I mean, you have someone who believes [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=628.1199999999999s)]
*  in a Muslim band who is incredibly racist things about not just that community, but other communities, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=632.84s)]
*  and who is committed, I believe, to allowing Netanyahu, who's a government that I personally [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=639.24s)]
*  don't support and I think is horrific, a blank check to do whatever he wants. And so I think [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=643.48s)]
*  there is a clear difference on that issue. And there is a clear difference on many issues. And so [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=648.0400000000001s)]
*  but on this issue, let's be crystal clear, she wants the war to end and she wants to cease fire, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=652.76s)]
*  and she wants to release the hostages. One final question. So Secretary Blinken said today that [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=656.76s)]
*  the US is not going to rule out authorizing Ukraine to use US munitions to strike even farther into [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=660.68s)]
*  Russian territory. That could potentially pose some escalatory risks. I don't know what your [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=667.4s)]
*  position is on that. Is that another issue where the status quo is just going to be perpetuated by [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=672.04s)]
*  Kamala Harris, even though we take these gradual steps up the escalatory ladder? I mean, are you [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=677.8s)]
*  in support of authorizing Ukraine to strike potentially Moscow with US munitions? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=682.8399999999999s)]
*  Well, I mean, first, that's not a position that you that Ukraine is taking to the United States. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=687.16s)]
*  Just just just to be clear, Ukrainians are lobbying for that permission. The United States is not [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=690.4399999999999s)]
*  taking that position. And so I think it's today they're open to it. I mean, the United States is [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=694.4399999999999s)]
*  not taking that position. And that's issues have haven't come before the Congress. And I don't [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=697.8s)]
*  imagine it would. But what I will say is that the vice president's position on Ukraine has also been [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=702.12s)]
*  clear. Her foreign policy has been to support the president of the White House's vice president. Her [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=707.56s)]
*  foreign policy in Ukraine is that she understands that Putin is a danger, that Ukrainian people need [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=711.64s)]
*  the support of the United States. She's been very clear about that. So Joe Biden is the last one. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=715.8s)]
*  Joe Biden is engaged in no direct communications with Vladimir Putin since the war started. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=721.24s)]
*  However much we might dislike Vladimir Putin, don't you want world leaders, especially those [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=728.68s)]
*  who preside over massive nuclear arsenals, to engage in communications? And would Kamala Harris [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=733.0s)]
*  retain that policy of zero communication? I'm going to trust President Biden, who I think is [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=737.64s)]
*  probably the most consequential president that we've had in the modern era and understands foreign [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=742.68s)]
*  policy almost better than anybody. And I trust his judgment and especially the way that he's [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=745.8s)]
*  going to trade and work with Vladimir Putin, who is a dictator. Congressman Garcia of California. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=749.16s)]
*  Thank you very much. Thank you. Hi, Senator Scott Worth Rumble. We have a quick minute with you. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=753.08s)]
*  How are you doing? What's your name? My name is Michael Tracy. This is my name. Hi. Hi. So today [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=759.24s)]
*  Secretary Blinken said that the Biden administration is considering allowing Ukraine [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=765.64s)]
*  to use U.S. munitions to strike even longer range targets inside of Russia. Is that prudent [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=771.3199999999999s)]
*  in your mind? And how would the Trump administration, a future Trump administration, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=778.84s)]
*  handle questions about what constraints to impose or not on Ukraine? Well, first off, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=782.92s)]
*  I think everything that Biden and Blinken and Harris have touched is a disaster. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=787.4s)]
*  If Trump was president, Putin wouldn't have invaded Ukraine. Trump was president, Iran wouldn't have [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=792.28s)]
*  had all the money. So the Houthis, his Bal and Hamas wouldn't have the money and the resources [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=797.16s)]
*  and Hamas wouldn't have invaded. If Trump was president, I don't think we'd have all the problems [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=801.32s)]
*  we have in Latin America. So I think what Biden, Harris and Blinken need to do is decide, do they [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=806.12s)]
*  want Ukraine to win or not? They've held back weapons. They've tried to run the war. So if they [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=812.84s)]
*  want Ukraine to win, let Ukraine win. If they don't want Ukraine to win, stop giving them weapons. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=820.12s)]
*  And looking forward, I mean, we can look in the past and say whether a different approach [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=825.4s)]
*  might have prevented the war. But looking forward to a potential second Trump administration, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=828.68s)]
*  would there be fewer constraints imposed on Ukraine involving questions like this? Would [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=831.64s)]
*  that be your preference? It's up to one person. It'll be up to Donald Trump. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=836.44s)]
*  What insight do we have in terms of what his policy approach would be there? [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=841.72s)]
*  I think you'd have to ask him. I'd love to. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=844.44s)]
*  If you look at his record, we were not at war when he was president. And so he did a variety of things [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=847.32s)]
*  to get us out of war. We did arm Ukraine, right? And that was one of the big grievances cited by [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=852.6800000000001s)]
*  Putin as to why he even went to war in the first place. The US was sending lethal arms to Ukraine. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=858.28s)]
*  Well, if we weren't at war, okay, first off, Putin didn't invade when Trump was president. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=862.6s)]
*  Okay. This all started with the Afghan debacle right after Biden became president and Harris [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=868.76s)]
*  became vice president. So, I mean, you know, you'd have, you know, we'll have to see what happens [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=875.48s)]
*  when Trump wins. But I mean, Biden's done has been a disaster for Ukraine, for Iran, for Israel. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=880.76s)]
*  You just look at the world. The world's a more dangerous place because of Biden and Harris plan. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=889.64s)]
*  So Trump addressed a gathering of the Republican Jewish Coalition last week. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=893.64s)]
*  Mary Maddison introduced him. She's spending a lot of money on this campaign, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=897.72s)]
*  I think a minimum of 100 million. What is her agenda? If you want to put it that way with regard [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=901.88s)]
*  to a second Trump administration, what are her policy priorities? And what is she looking for [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=910.12s)]
*  Trump to give her by with her investment of that amount of money, which is pretty staggering? [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=915.4799999999999s)]
*  I think it's pretty clear Trump was the most pro-Israel president in the history of this country. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=920.3599999999999s)]
*  And Maryam Adelson is somebody that believes in, you know, supports Israel. And if you look at [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=926.04s)]
*  Trump, you know, look at all the problems that Israel's having right now. None of them happened [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=934.04s)]
*  under Trump. It all happened under Biden and Harrison. So she wants the president's going to [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=938.6s)]
*  support Israel. Support Israel is kind of a cliche, though. I mean, what specific specifically would [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=942.36s)]
*  that mean on a tangible level? Would she want the U.S. to authorize Israel to maybe annex the full [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=947.88s)]
*  West Bank? There are some people in Israel who call for that. I think it's real simple. Don't [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=952.76s)]
*  support Iran. Don't appease Iran, which caused all the problems and support Israel. On Iran, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=958.84s)]
*  very quickly, and I'll let you go. The Trump administration had this policy of maximum pressure [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=965.24s)]
*  on Iran, imposing... They had that policy and it worked. Well, it didn't work if the objective was [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=970.84s)]
*  ultimately to change the Iranian government, right? And that seems to be what a lot of people would [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=977.96s)]
*  prefer to ultimately happen. It created a lot of immiseration within Iran. The economy obviously [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=982.2s)]
*  was very damaged by that. In Iran, could import lots of goods, even for medical supplies. So [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=988.5200000000001s)]
*  would we expect sanctions to be used as prolifically in a second Trump administration [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=994.6s)]
*  as in a first? And Biden continued many of those sanctions. I know you quibble with how vigorously [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=999.08s)]
*  he enforced them on the oil exports. He did. Iran has so much money right now because Biden [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1004.36s)]
*  didn't enforce it. And that's why Hamas had the money to go into Iran, why the Houthis [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1011.08s)]
*  still shooting at Americans, and why Hezbollah is shooting rockets into Israel. I mean, it's all [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1018.2800000000001s)]
*  because Biden, Harris have had this appeasement policy towards Shi, the Ayatollah. So when Trump [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1023.72s)]
*  wins, I hope he has maximum pressure against Iran. All right. Thanks a lot, Senator Scott. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1031.88s)]
*  Governor, I spoke to you in July and you said you had total confidence. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1035.96s)]
*  Since they're live and producers taking my head off. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1045.0s)]
*  Governor, I spoke to you in July and you said you had total confidence in Joe Biden's ability [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1049.16s)]
*  to retain sole authority over the nuclear codes until age 86. Do you still believe that? [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1053.4s)]
*  Joe Biden is doing an outstanding job as president of the United States. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1059.5600000000002s)]
*  Anthony Scaramucci, with all due respect, weren't you the press secretary in the Trump [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1065.64s)]
*  administration for like 12 days or something? 11. Sorry, I over- exactly. Tom's director, excuse me. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1070.1200000000001s)]
*  I was on the campaign for nine months. I raised probably $30 million, gave him a million personally. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1076.6000000000001s)]
*  I was on the executive committee for the transition team. So I worked on the campaign [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1082.0400000000002s)]
*  for almost a year. My question is, why does that pedigree make you such a valued surrogate [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1086.92s)]
*  for the Kamala Harris campaign? Like with all due respect, like why do people care? [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1094.68s)]
*  You should ask them. Well, you're standing here talking to me. So I'm indicting myself, I guess. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1099.16s)]
*  You might be indicting yourself, but I don't know why they care. But let me tell you something. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1103.4s)]
*  I'm helping her. It's resonating. It's been effective with independence. We're building a [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1107.72s)]
*  very, very broad coalition. Mr. Trump represents something to me that's very anti-American. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1112.76s)]
*  It doesn't stand for the traditional values of the Republican Party that I grew up in. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1117.96s)]
*  Which values? Well, you want to name one. Okay. Ronald Reagan was pro-immigration. His last speech [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1122.2s)]
*  that he gave was a pro-immigration speech. Mr. Trump is anti-immigration, not just illegal [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1128.44s)]
*  immigration, but immigration overall. He granted protective status to Venezuelan immigrants, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1134.04s)]
*  so it's selective. Read the agenda. Read the 902 page agenda. Read Agenda 47. Read Project 2025. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1139.32s)]
*  Go through the stuff that he's talking about. He's a divisive guy. He blows racist dog whistles [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1148.76s)]
*  every single day of his life. He splits things. I've worked for him. I know the MO. He'll say [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1154.12s)]
*  one thing that's very racist and very dog whistly. Then I'll say a second thing to countermand it so [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1159.64s)]
*  that there'll be enough meat out there for people like the talking heads of Fox News. Oh, he didn't [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1165.8799999999999s)]
*  really mean it. Did you get a chance to say hello to Donald Trump? He was just in the room. I didn't [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1170.36s)]
*  see him, no. But I'm happy to say hello to him. I have nothing personal against him. I just don't [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1173.56s)]
*  want him to be the president of the United States. So, Kamel Harris tonight touted the [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1177.88s)]
*  endorsement of Dick Cheney. Is he one of these traditional Republicans who people are looking [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1181.88s)]
*  back on retrospectively and valorizing? I think it's a very important endorsement for [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1187.5600000000002s)]
*  Vice President Harris because this guy's calling her things like Marxist and Communist and comrade, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1192.6000000000001s)]
*  and a guy like Dick Cheney is not endorsing her if any of those things were true. So, [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1199.4s)]
*  what we know about Mr. Trump, he's a lie machine. He told 30,000, 450 lies. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1204.04s)]
*  So why is Dick Cheney endorsing her? Do they have compatible worldviews? [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1208.52s)]
*  Well, incompatible enough. Remember, Dick Cheney, like myself, is a first principles person. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1211.96s)]
*  So what are you looking for? What's the principle? Invading Iraq? [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1216.44s)]
*  No, you know, you should let me talk. You're like a right-wing journalist, right? Hard right, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1219.56s)]
*  right? I got that. Let me talk. First principles about the Constitution. First principles is about [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1225.56s)]
*  freedom. First principles about where we are, what our identity is, not only to ourselves [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1231.16s)]
*  as Americans, but what our identity represents to the world. Those are first principles. Mr. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1237.5600000000002s)]
*  Trump is a very destructive guy. He's very denigrating to the country. He goes to these [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1242.0400000000002s)]
*  rallies and he denigrates our country. Okay, that's the country of my parents and my grandparents. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1246.76s)]
*  I don't like it very much and I want them to stop. The way he's going to stop is we're going to [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1252.92s)]
*  defeat him. Do you find it bizarre that skepticism of Dick Cheney is coded as right-wing in 2020? [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1256.52s)]
*  I guess I'm old enough to remember the early 2000s where that would have been a punchline to a joke. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1261.72s)]
*  The world has changed over the last 25 years. I think that this guy represents a systemic [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1267.0s)]
*  danger to our system. He's got people on his team and he himself has said this. They want to take [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1272.1200000000001s)]
*  the FBI out of the Department of Justice and link it directly, have it report directly to the [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1277.0s)]
*  president. He wants to fire 50,000 employees in the government and then rehire people to take [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1281.24s)]
*  a loyalty test to him. These are things that the average American looks at and says, you know, [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1286.6s)]
*  I don't want that. Okay. And so, so for me, I don't want my country turning into an autocracy [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1291.08s)]
*  where 5.7 billion other people are living in an autocracy. And Mr. Trump represents that. Mr. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1298.12s)]
*  Trump denied the election results last time. You know, his worst moments tonight, when he was trying [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1303.7199999999998s)]
*  to substantiate the great election lie that his friends at Fox News lost $783 million on. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1309.8s)]
*  It's a disaster. You got a guy who has 40 people that work for him, including his vice president, [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1317.0800000000002s)]
*  that have told you under no circumstances can we work for, endorse or vote for him. 40 people. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1322.68s)]
*  Let me ask this to you rhetorically. Let's say we all worked at a pharmaceutical company [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1329.56s)]
*  and a pill was being made and we saw the pill being made in the factory. He said, hey, [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1333.3200000000002s)]
*  that pill is going to kill your kid. Are you going to take the pill? [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1337.16s)]
*  You have people on his campaign that are telling you how destructive he is and what a threat he [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1340.6000000000001s)]
*  is to the Republic and our constitution. But if those people include John Bolton, [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1346.28s)]
*  Mark Esper, who was a former top Raytheon lobbyist, others, I mean, if you're a little bit [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1351.6399999999999s)]
*  circumspect about the influence of like the military industrial complex, wouldn't it be a [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1357.8799999999999s)]
*  point in his favor that those people have such negative view of him? I understand you have a [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1362.04s)]
*  tinfoil hat on your head. What tinfoil hat? What conspiracy theory did I assert? Because you're [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1366.04s)]
*  asserting something. Mark Esper, not a top Raytheon lobbyist. Trump, it was to his discredit that [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1372.68s)]
*  Trump appointed him defense secretary. Mark Esper served the country. He was a, as a, as a, [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1377.32s)]
*  as a Raytheon lobbyist. No, he didn't. He was in the American army. He wasn't a Raytheon lobbyist. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1382.1200000000001s)]
*  I think he was the top lobbyist at Raytheon when Trump appointed him. Lots of different things in [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1387.64s)]
*  his resume, including working for Raytheon. So don't follow what conspiracy theory I asserted. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1391.56s)]
*  No, you're, you're, you're implying that the 40 people that work for Donald Trump [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1396.68s)]
*  are in the tank of the deep state and you said the word, the term deep state, not me. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1401.0800000000002s)]
*  Ask one more question. Let's go to something else. All right. Here's another, here's another, [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1407.0s)]
*  you don't know my MO. You thought, you thought I'm a right wing because I express second system of [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1412.8400000000001s)]
*  Dick Cheney. Well, I'm not a Republican. I've been a registered Democrat. So I mean, [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1417.0s)]
*  final, final, final question. And maybe this is too conspiratorial for you and maybe it shows [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1423.96s)]
*  I'm wearing a tinfoil hat, but did Dick Cheney and George W. Bush uphold the constitution such [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1427.96s)]
*  that they're now a venerated favorable contrast with Donald Trump? Explain that to me. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1432.44s)]
*  Well, I think it's prima facie. I don't even think that needs to be explained. They, [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1438.44s)]
*  Bush and Cheney upheld the constitution. They certainly did. Really? They certainly [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1441.8000000000002s)]
*  fastened and they made a mistake going to that. What about the fourth amendment went to the UN [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1446.6000000000001s)]
*  and created that work. What, what are you implying the Patriot Act? [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1451.48s)]
*  Well, no, no, there was mass warrantless surveillance that was inaugurated under [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1455.08s)]
*  George W. Bush 2006. Well, first of all, you have to go to a judge to get the warrants. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1458.76s)]
*  Second of all, read the kangaroo court, the Pfizer court. Here we go with the tinfoil stuff. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1464.76s)]
*  There's, I can cite you, endless constitutional scholars who will talk about the kangaroo court [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1469.4s)]
*  of Pfizer court. Disagree with this stuff, but the law got voted in by the Congress. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1476.12s)]
*  It's called the Patriot Act. You may not like the law, then get yourself elected and go raise a [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1481.08s)]
*  caucus of people and get out of the law, vote to renege the law. We made a lot of the law, [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1487.64s)]
*  but the law got put into place and there is a process to protect people. I want my family safe. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1493.08s)]
*  Now I work for the American government. I understand the threats that are out there to the [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1498.52s)]
*  people of the United States and I want my family safe. And I like Bush and Cheney. That's just me. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1503.0s)]
*  All right. Well, I guess, you know, Democrat. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1508.28s)]
*  Congressman Kamel Harris tonight touted the endorsement of Dick Cheney. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1516.2s)]
*  Did you find that at all bizarre? Is Dick Cheney someone who's fit to judge the competence or [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1520.52s)]
*  character of a president? I mean, I'm old enough to remember when Dick Cheney was reviled by [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1526.9199999999998s)]
*  Democrats, rightly so, because he was integral in launching the Iraq war on false pretenses. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1531.3999999999999s)]
*  Dick Cheney is certainly competent to judge the one issue that matters, [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1535.88s)]
*  which is the preservation of our democracy. And look, why is he fit to judge that? [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1540.2800000000002s)]
*  Because he is supporting Kamel Harris, because she actually supports democracy. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1545.8000000000002s)]
*  Unless unlike Donald Trump, who you saw tonight, still can't handle the fact that he lost the [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1550.6000000000001s)]
*  election. He's willing to upend our democracy, put lies into people's heads that somehow this [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1555.16s)]
*  election was stolen. And look, Republicans and Democrats disagree on... Democrats used to accuse [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1561.72s)]
*  Petrani and Bush of stealing the 2000 elections. So how is he in a position to make this judgment [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1566.6000000000001s)]
*  to the extent that Kamel Harris is going to tout her on a national stage before the biggest audience [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1570.92s)]
*  she's ever spoken to? Dick Cheney is putting country over party on the one issue of democracy. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1574.84s)]
*  So Donald Trump incited an insurrection to try to stop the certification of the electoral college. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1583.24s)]
*  I was there on January 6th. I was one of the co-authors of the article of impeachment against [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1590.04s)]
*  Donald Trump, because he is a traitor who does not believe in democracy, and he still can't handle [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1596.76s)]
*  the fact that he lost the election. And you cannot be president of the United States if you don't [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1603.1599999999999s)]
*  respect the one issue that matters to America, which is our elections and respecting the peaceful [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1608.04s)]
*  transfer of power. That is why Dick Cheney endorsed Kamel Harris. I'm sure he doesn't agree with her [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1613.1599999999999s)]
*  on the overall majority issues, but that one issue is so paramount because it's the fundamental [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1618.28s)]
*  nature of our country. It is our democracy. Do you still think Donald Trump colluded with Russia? [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1623.24s)]
*  His campaign absolutely did. And they... Him personally. His campaign manager admitted he gave [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1629.32s)]
*  private, sensitive Trump campaign information to the Russians. It was polling data that anybody [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1636.04s)]
*  could have googled. It was not. It wasn't private and sensitive. It was polling data, which was [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1643.4s)]
*  nonsensical. Why is Trump's campaign manager giving information to the Russians? Just even think about [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1648.92s)]
*  what you're saying. Why are you defending his act of giving information to the Russians? Why is he [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1654.92s)]
*  even talking... Paul Manafort wasn't even charged with... Why wasn't... Paul Manafort is who you're [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1659.3200000000002s)]
*  talking about. He was not charged with colluding with Russia. Mueller could have charged him with [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1664.0400000000002s)]
*  that, correct? He admitted it. You know what Mueller said? Why didn't Mueller charge him? Mueller said [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1668.1200000000001s)]
*  the Russians systematically interfere in the elections in a sweeping manner. Why didn't he [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1672.12s)]
*  bring a single criminal charge against a Trump associate? I think it's very productive, actually. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1679.8s)]
*  Yeah, it's great. Why don't you think it's productive? [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1686.12s)]
*  Hello? You interrupted, so now I'm gonna ask you the question. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1691.9599999999998s)]
*  So much. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1694.76s)]
*  Congresswoman, tonight Kamala Harris endorsed... Sorry, touted the endorsement of Dick Cheney. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1698.76s)]
*  Did you find that at all strange? I mean, I'm old enough to remember the 2000s when Dick Cheney was [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1705.64s)]
*  integral in launching the Iraq war on false pretenses. Would it seem funny for a Democrat down [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1710.76s)]
*  the line to tout his endorsement? Does this mean they have compatible worldviews? What it means is [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1716.04s)]
*  that today's Republican party no longer resembles the Republican party of the past. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1723.48s)]
*  This has become... What's the Iraq war? This has become the Trump party. And I think the point [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1730.2s)]
*  she was trying to make was that people who are fleeing that party are fleeing it because Donald [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1736.44s)]
*  Trump is such a threat to national security. He's such a threat to the Constitution. He's a threat, [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1744.3600000000001s)]
*  a direct threat to our futures as Americans. Did Dick Cheney uphold the Constitution? [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1750.52s)]
*  I think her point was that people are fleeing the Republican party because Donald Trump is such a [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1755.0s)]
*  threat. Would you welcome the endorsement of Dick Cheney? I am here to support Vice President [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1762.36s)]
*  Harris and Governor Waltz, and I'm excited about a new generation of leadership that's going to [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1766.92s)]
*  turn the page on Donald Trump. Can I ask you a quick question about Ukraine? Today, Secretary Blinken [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1772.52s)]
*  said that the U.S. was open to potentially authorizing Ukraine to use U.S. munitions to [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1777.48s)]
*  strike even deeper into Russian territory. Kamala Harris didn't address that directly tonight, [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1782.84s)]
*  nor did Trump for that matter. But does that raise any concerns with you? Isn't that a step up, [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1788.92s)]
*  the escalatory ladder? Is there anything that Ukraine will not ultimately be authorized to do? [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1795.16s)]
*  I did not hear that, and I try not to comment on issues that I haven't directly heard about yet. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1802.2s)]
*  I've been traveling here. We had votes today. As soon as I catch up on that news, I would love to. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1809.8s)]
*  The Biden administration did authorize Ukraine to strike targets somewhat closer to the border [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1817.48s)]
*  with Russia. So you're familiar with that? I am. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1823.1599999999999s)]
*  What are your thoughts on that? Is that a prudent policy? [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1826.6s)]
*  I supported that decision. Why? [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1829.72s)]
*  We are seeing the aggression by Russia continue to escalate, and I think it is [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1833.48s)]
*  prudent for Ukraine to respond in kind. Using U.S. munitions? [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1841.96s)]
*  Yes. Thank you. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1846.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Senator, tonight Kamala Harris touted the endorsement of Dick Cheney. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1850.92s)]
*  She did. Did you find that at all bizarre? Would you welcome the endorsement of [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1855.32s)]
*  Dick Cheney? Am I the only one who remembers that he was integral in launching the Iraq war [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1859.48s)]
*  on false pretenses? Is that all the memory hold now? She's trying to win an election, right? And [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1863.16s)]
*  in winning an election, you're trying to build a coalition that's as big as possible. So it is [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1868.92s)]
*  important that there are a whole bunch of Republicans, many of them who worked very [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1874.84s)]
*  closely with Donald Trump, who having seen him up close are convinced that he is deeply unqualified [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1880.3600000000001s)]
*  to do the job. So I do think it's important that there are a host of people who disagree with [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1888.44s)]
*  Kamala Harris on policy, but are supporting her because they believe that the election of Donald [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1896.3600000000001s)]
*  Trump would mean the destruction of our democracy. It just, I think, solidifies the stakes of the [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1902.2s)]
*  election. But do Dick Cheney and Kamala Harris really disagree substantively? They seem to have [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1908.2s)]
*  fairly compatible foreign policy worldviews from everything I heard from Kamala tonight. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1911.88s)]
*  Yeah, I think they disagree. Significantly. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1915.4s)]
*  On what? [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1917.3200000000002s)]
*  Seriously? On what? [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1917.56s)]
*  Yeah, what do they disagree on? [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1920.36s)]
*  I mean, did Kamala Harris support the Iraq war that Dick Cheney started? [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1922.04s)]
*  She wasn't in public office at the time. She may well have. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1926.84s)]
*  She supported giving unfettered subsidy to the oil and gas industry. So you asked me [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1929.0s)]
*  for some examples, I gave you some. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1935.8s)]
*  Senator, Kamala Harris tonight touted the endorsement of Dick Cheney, [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1939.3999999999999s)]
*  who I'm sure I don't have to remind you. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1943.3999999999999s)]
*  You're smirking. I had a similar reaction, I have to say. Integral in launching the Iraq war on [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1944.76s)]
*  false pretenses. This was Kamala Harris's biggest audience of her career. Very important to how [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1951.08s)]
*  she's being introduced to the American people. And she's choosing to cite the endorsement of [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1958.68s)]
*  Dick Cheney. Didn't you find that bizarre? What I found that the vice president was able to do [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1962.76s)]
*  tonight was to introduce herself to the American people. What I found is that she was able to [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1968.12s)]
*  articulate her vision for the future of the country. I found that she was able to talk about [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1972.36s)]
*  the support of people who are different than her, who think about the world very differently than [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1976.4399999999998s)]
*  she does as a demonstration of how we need to unite our country and move our country in a [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1981.6399999999999s)]
*  direction where all Americans can see themselves and their families doing more than just surviving. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1988.4399999999998s)]
*  But would you welcome the endorsement of Dick Cheney? [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1993.7199999999998s)]
*  I think that, again, what the vice president was doing tonight was talking about how together [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=1997.24s)]
*  we have more in common than what it is that separates us and that together we have to build [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2002.12s)]
*  a pathway for our country, for all Americans. She also denounced Donald Trump for fitfully and [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2007.0s)]
*  in a flawed way, brokering some sort of negotiation with the Taliban, saying, [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2015.0s)]
*  oh, he negotiated with terrorists. That's another cliche from the Bush era. Do you think it was wrong [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2021.32s)]
*  to try to come to some sort of settlement in the Afghanistan war, which Joe Biden culminated when [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2026.2s)]
*  he withdrew U.S. forces in 2021? What did you make of that exchange? [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2032.28s)]
*  What I thought the vice president, again, was trying to communicate was that the role of this [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2038.52s)]
*  country and the commander in chief in global situations around the world is one that has to [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2044.8400000000001s)]
*  be taken very, very seriously. And there are ways that that needs to be done and taken seriously [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2051.64s)]
*  with the kind of character and integrity as expected of the president of the United States. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2058.04s)]
*  And she was offering an example where she thought that that could have been done differently. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2064.52s)]
*  And she objected on principle to the very idea of Donald Trump negotiating with the Taliban. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2068.3599999999997s)]
*  I didn't hear it that way. So maybe we just had a different interpretation of what we saw tonight. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2073.3199999999997s)]
*  All right. Thank you. Thank you. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2077.4s)]
*  Congressman, Kamala Harris tonight touted the endorsement of Dick Cheney. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2082.6s)]
*  That was one of the few people whose support that she touted. John McCain or she invoked the legacy [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2087.72s)]
*  of John McCain, people associated with George W. Bush, Mitt Romney, on Dick Cheney in particular. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2094.2799999999997s)]
*  I'm old enough to remember the Bush years. I know you are. You served in the military in that era. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2100.44s)]
*  What does it tell you that Dick Cheney's worldview is apparently compatible enough [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2105.16s)]
*  with Kamala Harris's worldview that she's going on her biggest national stage of her career [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2110.68s)]
*  and touting the endorsement of Dick Cheney? Did you find that bizarre? [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2116.2s)]
*  No, what this is about is who's fit to be commander in chief, [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2119.3199999999997s)]
*  who actually will respect and support the Constitution of the United States. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2123.96s)]
*  How is Dick Cheney fit to determine who's fit to be commander in chief? [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2127.72s)]
*  And that's why the coalition, the folks that are surrounding and supporting [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2130.8399999999997s)]
*  Kamala Harris is very broad because all the policy issues that we're debating tonight, [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2135.56s)]
*  at the end of the day, there's only one candidate there and that was Kamala Harris, [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2141.08s)]
*  who respects the Constitution, who respects the rule of law, and won't continue to deal in big law. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2144.84s)]
*  Did Dick Cheney and George W. Bush respect the Constitution and rule of law? I remember [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2151.56s)]
*  mass warrantless surveillance being inaugurated under that administration. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2155.4s)]
*  Very clear that this election is about who can actually respect the rule of law, [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2159.0s)]
*  and that is Kamala Harris. You have in Donald Trump, somebody who has repeatedly undermined [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2163.72s)]
*  the rule of law, dealt in a conspiracy. Didn't Dick Cheney undermine the rule of law? [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2167.9599999999996s)]
*  And then actually moved his supporters to attack the U.S. Capitol. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2171.48s)]
*  Senator, Kamala Harris touted tonight the endorsement of Dick Cheney. If memory serves, [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2180.04s)]
*  you lost your leg in combat in Iraq in a war that Dick Cheney was integral into launching [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2185.08s)]
*  on false pretenses. So if you want to claim that Dick Cheney now is putting country above [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2191.96s)]
*  party or what have you, all right, I'll take that point, I suppose. But don't you find it a bit [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2198.68s)]
*  bizarre that Dick Cheney is one of the few people whose endorsement that the Democratic [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2204.2s)]
*  nominee touted in this debate? Well, she touted many endorsements. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2209.08s)]
*  She also talked about all of the retired generals, all of the people, the former Trump, [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2212.84s)]
*  the people that worked with Trump who said, hey, we work with this guy. He is clearly unfit to be [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2217.4s)]
*  president of the United States. He is unfit to be commander in chief. He disparages our troops. He [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2222.36s)]
*  has no respect for our military men and women, our their families. And he is incompetent as a leader [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2226.6s)]
*  of the greatest nation on the face of the earth. What about Dick Cheney? [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2232.44s)]
*  Clear. Well, again, he's one of the people who has come out and list Cheney as well. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2235.56s)]
*  But bottom line is that. And what did you make of her touting his endorsement? [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2240.36s)]
*  I think somebody even even Dick Cheney, even Dick Cheney says that Donald Trump is not fit [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2244.12s)]
*  to be president of the United States. That says something about how low Donald Trump was to say [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2250.7599999999998s)]
*  about Kamala Harris. So, Mr. Kennedy, back in May, you said that Donald Trump had contributed [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2254.04s)]
*  to exacerbating tensions with Russia, had bragged about arming Ukraine. Do you stand by those [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2262.92s)]
*  criticisms? I said it during my speech in Arizona, why my opinions about Donald Trump [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2268.84s)]
*  evolved. And a lot of that, a lot of that evolution came during a series of conversations where we [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2276.84s)]
*  spoke particularly about Ukraine and about what he intends to do when it gave me a lot of confidence [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2283.2400000000002s)]
*  that he's going to have in the war immediately. He hasn't stopped bragging about arming Ukraine, [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2288.2000000000003s)]
*  has he? [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2291.4s)]
*  Mr. Kennedy, what's your message to the President of the United States? [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2321.4s)]
*  And Trump never stopped bragging about arming Ukraine, has he? He still, he repeats that to this day, hasn't he? [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2329.0s)]
*  Senator, there was a moment when Donald Trump referenced the deal that was brokered between [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2343.96s)]
*  Mike Pompeo and the Taliban in 2019-2020. And Donald Trump effectively said that his intent [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2348.92s)]
*  apparently was to renege on the deal or claim that the Taliban had violated the provisions of that deal [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2356.6800000000003s)]
*  and therefore maintain a U.S. force presence in Afghanistan. Does that mean that the war [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2361.8s)]
*  effectively would have not ended if Trump had won a second term? Donald Trump's point was that [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2366.84s)]
*  he negotiated a deal through Mike Pompeo that the Taliban did renege on. There's a brand new report [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2372.04s)]
*  out, it goes hundreds of pages, that shows how they reneged on it. He said he showed a house to [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2377.72s)]
*  the picture of the Taliban's leaders house to him. Why? The message was, we know where you live, [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2382.52s)]
*  we will kill you if you harm the hair of a single American soldier. The exact opposite of what Donald [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2388.6s)]
*  Trump and Kamala Harris have done. So U.S. troops would have remained in Afghanistan under Trump, [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2393.48s)]
*  receiving incoming fire, rocket attacks on Bahamera base and so forth? The Taliban, like most other [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2398.7599999999998s)]
*  foreign leaders, would have been afraid to renege on their deal with Donald Trump and Donald Trump [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2404.84s)]
*  certainly wouldn't have left all those people behind, left all those weapons and equipment [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2409.0s)]
*  behind either. Senator Graham, tonight Donald Trump said that Israel would cease to exist if [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2413.6400000000003s)]
*  Kamala Harris was elected. Hasn't the Biden-Harris administration supplied an enormous amount of [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2419.08s)]
*  munitions to Israel? How would it cease to exist if Kamala Harris gets in office and continues the [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2427.2400000000002s)]
*  same policy? The biggest threat to the Jewish state is Iran and they've let Iran run wild. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2432.2s)]
*  They were broke, they were in a box and they relieved the sanctions and the root of all evil [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2437.8799999999997s)]
*  in the mid-east is Iran and these folks have let Iran run wild and is threatening the very existence [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2445.08s)]
*  of the Jewish state. If the Iranians get a nuclear weapon, I think they will use it. I don't think [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2451.0s)]
*  they're going to stop unless somebody makes them stop and they're not worried about Biden. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2455.96s)]
*  Senator Scott, really quickly tonight, sorry, tonight Donald Trump said that if Kamala Harris [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2463.16s)]
*  were elected, if Kamala Harris were elected, Israel would cease to exist. How could that be the case [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2469.3199999999997s)]
*  if the Biden-Harris administration has supplied such an extraordinary amount of munitions to Israel? [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2475.08s)]
*  Actually, I'd say the reverse of that is actually the truth, that the Biden administration has [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2479.48s)]
*  slow-walked the resources necessary for Israel to have already won the war. Number one, number two, [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2483.8799999999997s)]
*  the first tweet that came out, the first communication that came out of the White House [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2488.84s)]
*  on October the 7th was actually telling Israel to stand down. I would rather have a president [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2492.92s)]
*  who stands strong, firm and completely on the side of right and standing with our greatest ally in [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2497.88s)]
*  the Middle East, Israel. That did not happen under the Biden-Harris administration. So, sorry. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2503.32s)]
*  Yeah, we're fumbling around. So, it was clear that the fact of the matter is Donald Trump has been a [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2510.04s)]
*  strong, clear supporter of Israel and thank you, and Biden-Harris have been, thank you, [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2515.72s)]
*  have a good night, tapping in their support. So, would Trump remove any of the constraints that [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2522.52s)]
*  the Biden administration has imposed on Israel? [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2528.2799999999997s)]
*  Michelle Lujan Grisham, correct? Thank you, first try. Didn't even have to Wikipedia the [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2535.24s)]
*  pronunciation. I don't know they would have given you the right pronunciation, but thank you. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2540.2s)]
*  Can't trust Wikipedia. I know that from experience. So, we're about six weeks since [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2543.96s)]
*  Kamala Harris was effectively named the Democratic nominee. She's given a total of one extended [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2549.16s)]
*  television interview. You do many national television interviews, despite being, you know, [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2555.0s)]
*  cover of Southwestern State. It's not always front and center and American consciousness. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2559.64s)]
*  I'll try. I love New Mexico. Front and center. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2565.0s)]
*  Lots of movies get filmed there nowadays, tax credits. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2568.92s)]
*  You got it, and a lot of important historical things have happened in my beautiful, great state. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2571.96s)]
*  Watch out. Isn't it true that the oldest church in the United States is in New Mexico? I forget [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2577.48s)]
*  the name now, but it's like a San Miguel mission and it's right there in Santa Fe. And we were [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2582.84s)]
*  being governed a mere 200 years before the pilgrims loaded onto the Mayflower. So, we're a state with [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2589.32s)]
*  a long, robust history. And frankly, something that people probably don't know is that Spanish [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2598.36s)]
*  is our official language in New Mexico. That. Okay. And there's also a Las Vegas in New Mexico, [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2604.36s)]
*  which people should be more familiar with. They should. It's not the entertainment capital [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2609.96s)]
*  in that way, but it is a beautiful northern New Mexico rural community where one of half my [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2614.76s)]
*  Hispanic family is from, rural Medellin. Well, the question I did want to ask you was Kamala [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2621.7200000000003s)]
*  Harris has done a total of one televised interview as a joint interview with Tim Walz. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2627.48s)]
*  She's been effectively the Democratic nominee for six weeks. Don't you find that bewildering? [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2633.0s)]
*  I don't, and I'll tell you why. First of all, you all, thank you, are covering every aspect, [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2639.2400000000002s)]
*  and we expect that and we want it. We want people to be able to get their sources of information [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2645.16s)]
*  from a variety of sources. And two, in a campaign, in a close race, where should you be [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2650.28s)]
*  on the campaign trail, meeting voters where they are, telling your personal stories, knocking [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2657.16s)]
*  on doors, having rallies, making phone calls. She is doing the real work that we need. And I don't [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2661.64s)]
*  think it's an indication of anything other than this is a very short abbreviated window, something [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2669.24s)]
*  we're not used to in this country. You know, you campaign for two years. I campaigned for governor [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2675.7999999999997s)]
*  in a state where I met, I've reported 12 generations because I can prove that. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2681.16s)]
*  I'm sure you talk very frequently with media, correct? [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2686.8399999999997s)]
*  I was mostly on the campaign job. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2689.72s)]
*  But you talk to media. I know that. I follow you. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2691.72s)]
*  Yeah, but I was also on Capitol Hill. And there's a gaggle of media that is out my front door, [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2693.7999999999997s)]
*  all the way to my walk to the hill. This is not the same situation. So I think she's doing, [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2700.3599999999997s)]
*  I would make the same decision. I know what it's like when people need to be, you know, [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2706.84s)]
*  hear from you. They want you to respect them enough to be at their front door. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2712.36s)]
*  She's doing the campaign work. And I fully expect that you and others will have a lot more time. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2716.76s)]
*  And given that I'm in a fight to get her in the White House, [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2722.2000000000003s)]
*  I'm expecting you to be on the front lawn talking to her often. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2725.4s)]
*  I would love to talk to her. We haven't gotten the chance. Could you perhaps facilitate that? [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2729.7200000000003s)]
*  Well, I'm going to facilitate that by getting her into the White House. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2733.72s)]
*  OK. Quickly on immigration, obviously a big issue. The Republicans have [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2737.08s)]
*  made that one of their primary attack lines against Kamala Harris. I don't know if you [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2740.9199999999996s)]
*  want to say that she was border czar. That's kind of a made up term, but she was designated [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2745.3199999999997s)]
*  by the Biden administration early on in this term to preside over issues involving, I guess, [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2748.7599999999998s)]
*  the root causes of immigration. So does she bear any responsibility for the massive influx of [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2755.0s)]
*  migrants that have come over the border, as you well know, as a border state governor? [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2760.4399999999996s)]
*  Well, those crossings are down. So I want to make sure they were massively up in the first [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2763.56s)]
*  portion of the Biden administration. Well, they were massively up in the [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2767.7999999999997s)]
*  Trump administration. He wants and not by as much. Well, that because he was taking babies out of the [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2770.68s)]
*  arms of their mothers. You want a chilling, disgusting effects. He wants concentration camps. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2778.12s)]
*  He wants mass deportations. He's not into any concentration camps. That has a strong connotation. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2784.52s)]
*  It does. But I mean, if you look at Project 2025, I read that to say that if you're going to do [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2790.68s)]
*  mass deportations, I'd like to understand exactly what that means. And my connotation in frame of [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2796.9199999999996s)]
*  reference is that this is heinous. Go back to the vice president. She wants a bipartisan border deal. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2802.8399999999997s)]
*  Trump killed one when I was in Congress. I was the chair of the Congressional Hispanic caucus. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2811.48s)]
*  He ripped away protections for dreamers. He has no interest in a bipartisan deal. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2816.7599999999998s)]
*  He wants to sow fear and hate in America. And it is another remarkable reason I stand. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2822.44s)]
*  But what about what? Last question. What about addressing the root causes of these massive [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2829.7999999999997s)]
*  migrant inflows that come from South and Central America, such as in Venezuela, [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2833.8799999999997s)]
*  where the Biden administration has maintained the Trump administration's sanctions regime, [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2838.04s)]
*  thus driving people out because they're in desperate economic conditions? [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2841.7999999999997s)]
*  Have to have a congressional investment and strategy to do any of that. But she has, in fact, [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2845.3199999999997s)]
*  I think, and if you went to the Latin America meeting in L.A., I think it was a lot of movement [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2852.12s)]
*  about the kind of economic opportunities that we could do if we could get Congress on board. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2858.52s)]
*  And I believe she can get that work done. All right. Thanks, Governor. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2863.4s)]
*  Are we rolling? Okay. Yeah, leave it in. What the hell? That kind of that basically sums up [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2875.08s)]
*  my reaction to tonight's debate. Just a really disgusting, phlegm-infested [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2882.84s)]
*  disaster of a cough. That sums it up. Yeah, so we're here, I guess it's past midnight at this point. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2891.88s)]
*  We're still hanging around the spin room. I tried to bring a no-spin room mentality or a [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2899.32s)]
*  no-spin mentality like Bill O'Reilly once did to the spin room. Asked the questions that I think [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2906.44s)]
*  ought to be asked of both Republicans and Democrats. I had a good time asking lots of Democrats about [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2913.0s)]
*  Kamala Harris touting the endorsement of Dick Cheney, which, I mean, [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2921.32s)]
*  would have bewildered any Democrat 10, 15, 20 years ago, but now it's just something to be [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2926.04s)]
*  valued and esteemed, evidently. I did get to talk to a decent number of Republicans as well [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2933.16s)]
*  about some of the more dubious foreign policy, largely prescriptions of Donald Trump. But I [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2942.6s)]
*  really do have to say, and though I usually am not inclined to declare a winner or a loser of a [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2954.04s)]
*  particular debate, I will say that Kamala Harris, in my judgment, was the automatic loser of this [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2958.84s)]
*  debate just by invoking the Dick Cheney endorsement. Because if I didn't say that, I would be betraying [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2964.84s)]
*  like my 16-year-old self. Donald Trump, I would say, was like a secondary loser, just for like [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2970.6s)]
*  babbling about Israel and, you know, weirdly claiming that Putin killed millions of people [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2977.08s)]
*  in Ukraine and all this other kind of stuff. But yeah, the big loser, the one who takes the big L [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2983.4s)]
*  on the forehead to me was Kamala and, to a lesser extent, Trump, but they both lost in my judgment, [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2988.92s)]
*  and so did we as an American public. So, for now, from Philadelphia, the city of, not brotherly love [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=2995.24s)]
*  tonight, the city of brotherly anger and frustration, farewell. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9TGoNtVi5w&t=3003.4s)]
