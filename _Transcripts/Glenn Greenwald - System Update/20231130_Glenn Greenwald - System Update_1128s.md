# How Does It End?! Leading Palestine Expert, Rashid Khalidi, on Israel-Gaza
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [November 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo)
*  Thinking about that, the Israeli midterm or long-term plan, meaning what happens when [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=0.0s)]
*  this bombing campaign finally comes to an end, when the ground invasion either turns [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=13.16s)]
*  into some sort of partial occupation, reoccupation of Gaza or some international force or whatever, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=17.2s)]
*  if you look at the scope of the destruction in northern Gaza, there have been reports [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=24.12s)]
*  that 60% of all buildings, if not destroyed, are architecturally compromised, not safe [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=28.2s)]
*  to inhabit. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=34.36s)]
*  The sewage system, the electrical system, the hospital system are completely destroyed. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=36.12s)]
*  To some extent, northern Gaza has been rendered in a large degree uninhabitable in terms of [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=42.879999999999995s)]
*  just any kind of modern society. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  How would these internally displaced Gazans, who are now in southern Gaza and dispersed [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=52.68s)]
*  throughout the country, really in any reasonable or meaningful way, get back to any kind of [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=58.72s)]
*  meaningful or normal life in northern Gaza, even if the Israelis were to permit that? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=63.36s)]
*  I think rendering northern Gaza uninhabitable was actually a declared war aim. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=69.28s)]
*  The Minister of Defense, Galant, various Israeli generals, said that. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=74.36s)]
*  When you cut off electricity and you cut off water, you are in effect making the place [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=79.2s)]
*  uninhabitable. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=83.12s)]
*  When you destroy or render unusable most of the hospitals in northern Gaza, when you destroy [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=84.24000000000001s)]
*  schools, when you destroy a variety of other infrastructure, you are rendering northern [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=90.52000000000001s)]
*  Gaza uninhabitable. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=97.04s)]
*  Now, the claim is that this was intended to destroy Hamas infrastructure. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=98.04s)]
*  My guess is that there was, as they said, a desire to render that part, at least of [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=104.82s)]
*  Gaza, uninhabitable. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=111.17999999999999s)]
*  Now, you can see that there's a doctrine here. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=112.74s)]
*  It's a doctrine that was first adopted in 2006, or at least first enunciated after the [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=116.61999999999999s)]
*  2006 war on Lebanon. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=120.89999999999999s)]
*  It was the so-called Dahya doctrine, Dahya being the southern suburbs of Beirut, which [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=122.86s)]
*  were flattened by Israeli bombing in 2006. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=127.1s)]
*  The man who is now a member of the war cabinet, a former chief of staff by the name of Gaddi [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=131.54s)]
*  Eisenkot, actually enunciated this. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=135.42s)]
*  He said, we will not accept proportionality. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=137.7s)]
*  We will act un-proportionally, and we will flatten villages. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=140.5s)]
*  We will do what we did to the Dahya. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=145.06s)]
*  In other words, we will destroy in order to destroy in a punitive fashion. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=147.06s)]
*  I think that is what Israel is doing. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=154.06s)]
*  Now, what that means for the day after, well, I think it's connected in the first instance [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=156.1s)]
*  to what they were hoping, which is to get people out of Gaza, decrease the Palestinian [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=160.72s)]
*  population within the borders of mandatory Palestine. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=164.92s)]
*  In other words, launch another stage of the ethnic cleansing of Palestine. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=168.12s)]
*  If that proves impossible, the next best thing is to squeeze them into a smaller area, maybe [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=173.0s)]
*  push them into southern Gaza. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=177.72s)]
*  But I don't think that any of these things are necessarily beyond rendering Gaza uninhabitable, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=179.16s)]
*  which the minister of defense said. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=183.96s)]
*  I don't think any of these things are entirely clear. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=186.6s)]
*  I think, as you suggested, there are multiple factions in this government. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=188.92s)]
*  The military has its own views. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=193.2s)]
*  The prime minister, who basically wants to continue the war and not lose this government, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=195.76s)]
*  which keeps him in power, failing which he would go to trial, presumably. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=201.39999999999998s)]
*  And then other factions within the government, the Likud party, the extreme right-wing parties [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=206.83999999999997s)]
*  which want to see ethnic cleansing as soon as possible and as much of Palestine as possible, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=210.88s)]
*  and so forth. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=215.83999999999997s)]
*  To me, frankly, and I'm reading the Israeli press carefully, it's not clear that they [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=217.4s)]
*  have a clear idea or a unified idea of what they want to do with the Gazans once this [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=221.08s)]
*  military campaign is over, whenever it's over. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=226.76s)]
*  On this stated goal of destroying Hamas, I don't think we ever got clarity about exactly [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=230.68s)]
*  what that means. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=236.0s)]
*  Although the Israelis made clear from the beginning, Netanyahu on down, they said, we [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=237.0s)]
*  don't mean we're going to erode the power of Hamas. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=242.88s)]
*  We don't mean we're going to undermine it. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=246.0s)]
*  We don't mean we're going to weaken Hamas. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=247.28s)]
*  We mean we're going to destroy it, eradicate it, remove it from existing in Gaza. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=248.62s)]
*  Obviously, with a war like this, facts are hard to come by, so let's just take the Israeli [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=253.44s)]
*  numbers, the numbers given by the Israeli military. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=258.48s)]
*  According to the Israeli military, they have thus far killed 1,500 to 2,000 Hamas militants. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=260.64s)]
*  So let's take the maximum number, 2,000. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=267.32s)]
*  And according to the Israelis as well, there are 30,000 Hamas fighters. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=270.12s)]
*  So they've killed 1,15th of all the Hamas fighters that existed at the start of the [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=275.72s)]
*  war. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=280.32000000000005s)]
*  Presumably, there's going to be more anti-Israel radicals and people who hate Israel after [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=281.32000000000005s)]
*  this destruction that they've witnessed, after the amount of death. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=286.16s)]
*  But let's just keep that number in place. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=288.76000000000005s)]
*  30,000 Hamas militants. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=291.56s)]
*  That would mean in order to kill all Hamas militants, just the minimum necessary I would [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=294.08000000000004s)]
*  assume to achieve this goal of destroying Hamas, they would have to kill 15 times more [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=299.92s)]
*  Hamas militants than they have thus far. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=305.84000000000003s)]
*  And at the current rate of civilian death, that would mean that they would basically [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=307.88s)]
*  end up killing 200,000, 250,000 Gazans in total. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=311.84000000000003s)]
*  Do you think there is any world in which the world just stands by and watches something [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=318.24s)]
*  like that take place? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=322.88s)]
*  No, absolutely not. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=324.88s)]
*  The United States wouldn't tolerate it because the Biden administration couldn't tolerate [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=327.44s)]
*  it because public opinion is already against this war. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=331.88s)]
*  Majority of Americans are in favor of a ceasefire. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=335.32s)]
*  They want it to stop. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=337.79999999999995s)]
*  They do not accept the Biden administration and the Israeli government's insistence on [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=339.08s)]
*  continuing the war until, quote unquote, Hamas is destroyed, whatever that means. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=343.52s)]
*  I mean, whether it means killing 20,000 odd more Hamas militants and God knows how many [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=348.2s)]
*  thousand more civilians, tens of thousands more civilians, and destroying even more [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=353.96s)]
*  of the infrastructure of Gaza. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=358.71999999999997s)]
*  60% has already been rendered uninhabitable and unusable. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=360.36s)]
*  God knows how much more there is to destroy. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=363.96s)]
*  But I do not think that the world public opinion, Arab public opinion, but for that [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=366.88s)]
*  matter, American public opinion will put up with that. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=371.44s)]
*  I think there'll be a rebellion within the Democratic Party. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=374.12s)]
*  I think the president would be guaranteed of losing the 2024 election. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=376.96s)]
*  And I think that he would he would be obliged to stop this long before we got to those [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=381.04s)]
*  apocalyptic numbers. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=386.32s)]
*  So I don't think that there is any possibility of our reaching anything like those [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=387.36s)]
*  numbers, even if those numbers are realistic. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=392.64s)]
*  I mean, let's let's assume that they're highly exaggerated, which I think is the case. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=394.40000000000003s)]
*  I don't think there's any chance of killing 10 or 20,000 Hamas militants, no matter how [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=397.68s)]
*  many civilians Israel kills and no matter how many tunnels. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=403.52000000000004s)]
*  You read the Israeli military correspondents and they're saying they've done very limited [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=407.32s)]
*  damage to the tunnel system. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=411.6s)]
*  Well, they've dropped how many thousand tons of bombs a day, a week on Gaza, and they still [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=413.32s)]
*  have only minimally damaged the tunnel system. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=418.71999999999997s)]
*  They've killed 2000 by their estimate, 30,000 militants. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=422.47999999999996s)]
*  I just it just does not seem to me within the world of possibility that this could go [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=426.76s)]
*  on to that extent. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=432.71999999999997s)]
*  How it stops, however, I don't know. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=434.32s)]
*  You're somebody who's followed this conflict for most of your career as a scholar, as an [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=437.0s)]
*  academic, as a historian. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=442.08s)]
*  You've referred to on a couple of occasions this public opinion that has turned against [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=444.0s)]
*  the Democratic Party against Joe Biden for his support of what's taking place in Israel. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=449.28s)]
*  I do think there's an interesting dynamic that it is the case that for a lot of years [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=453.08s)]
*  now, maybe going back to 2014, the Israeli-Palestinian issue has pretty much been on the [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=458.84s)]
*  back burner of American politics. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=462.71999999999997s)]
*  You have all these young people who have started to pay attention to politics for the first [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=464.24s)]
*  time. A lot of people paid attention to politics for the first time only because of Trump. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=467.84s)]
*  This is the first real look they're getting at Israel and the Democratic Party's relationship [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=472.32s)]
*  to it. And you have these mass protests all over the world, hundreds of thousands of people [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=476.56s)]
*  in major Western cities. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=481.64s)]
*  Like you have to go back to the Iraq War to find protests on this level. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=483.08s)]
*  As somebody who has followed this, this conflict has been in the middle of it in so many ways [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=487.88s)]
*  for so long now. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=493.12s)]
*  Is this a kind of radical or fundamental change in terms of public opinion and the amount [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=494.44s)]
*  of opposition to what the Israelis are doing and the way in which the U.S. is supporting [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=500.32s)]
*  them? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=503.96s)]
*  I mean, there has been a trend in this direction, but I think you put your finger on it. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=506.04s)]
*  I think that this is a moment when a newly awakened generation with new access to information [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=509.4s)]
*  is for the first time really looking very carefully at things that are happening in [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=516.16s)]
*  Israel and Palestine. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=521.84s)]
*  And they clearly do not like what they see. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=523.36s)]
*  There's an NBC poll that came out the other day of voters from 18 to 34. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=525.9599999999999s)]
*  Seventy percent of voters in that age group disapprove of the Biden administration's [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=531.7199999999999s)]
*  handling of this war. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=536.7199999999999s)]
*  That's an astonishing percentage. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=538.24s)]
*  I mean, a majority of Americans want to ceasefire, but that 70 percent of young voters, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=540.64s)]
*  that includes Republicans and independents. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=547.1999999999999s)]
*  I mean, that's a remarkable number. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=549.04s)]
*  And it's part of a trend that I think has really been accentuated by this war. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=551.76s)]
*  But that's been going on for actually a very long time. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=556.52s)]
*  The polling over many years shows a drift away from sympathy for Israel and towards [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=558.64s)]
*  greater sympathy for the Palestinians. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=565.56s)]
*  And this war has crystallized that, I think. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=567.64s)]
*  Yeah. So for those of us who have followed this debate, this conflict for a long time, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=570.64s)]
*  there's all the arguments that everybody can rehearse in their sleep. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=576.28s)]
*  You show people the death polls in Gaza and people say, oh, Hamas uses them as human [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=579.8s)]
*  shields. Hamas operates from hospitals, they operate from us. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=584.8s)]
*  All the arguments that everybody knows and knows the responses to. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=587.8399999999999s)]
*  I do want to ask you about a couple of perspectives that are, I think, the most potent [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=591.48s)]
*  ones that Israelis and pro-Israel supporters in the United States and the West offer. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=598.7199999999999s)]
*  And I want to begin by asking you this. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=603.8s)]
*  In almost every war, there's two questions, broadly speaking, I think, that need to be [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=606.0s)]
*  asked. One is, is there a moral or legal justification for the war, for the force [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=609.68s)]
*  being used? And then is it a wise use of force, even if it's morally justifiable? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=614.68s)]
*  Will it produce benefits on the whole as opposed to detriment? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=619.36s)]
*  After the October 7 massacre that did kill hundreds of civilians, whatever that [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=624.76s)]
*  number is, 500, 800, 900, whatever that amount is. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=630.8s)]
*  Do you think Israel had a legal and moral right to use force in Gaza against the [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=635.9599999999999s)]
*  group and the people who perpetrated that attack? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=643.8s)]
*  You know, the problem with that question is its framing. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=648.1999999999999s)]
*  Gaza had been under siege for 16 years. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=653.56s)]
*  Israel had assumed that it could live a peaceful, quiet life while putting its [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=656.36s)]
*  boot heel on the Palestinians in the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=661.48s)]
*  And sooner or later, that had to explode. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=665.8s)]
*  Now, it exploded in a particularly ugly fashion with these massacres. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=667.68s)]
*  It resulted in the highest death toll among Israeli civilians in the entire history of [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=672.48s)]
*  Israel's wars since 1948. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=679.0799999999999s)]
*  So there was going to be a reaction necessarily and inevitably. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=681.6s)]
*  But if you step back one minute, I think it's very clear that if you occupy and if [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=685.48s)]
*  you imprison and blockade and besiege a population, sooner or later, that population [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=691.8399999999999s)]
*  is going to react violently and negatively. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=697.76s)]
*  Israelis talk about this as if it's irrational. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=701.28s)]
*  It's not irrational at all. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=703.52s)]
*  The nature of the violence is, of course, horrific that was carried out on that day. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=705.6s)]
*  But when you do this to people and you pretend that out of sight is out of mind and you [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=710.48s)]
*  can live a normal life in suburban communities with other people in a cage within a [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=716.28s)]
*  couple of miles of you, you are storing up problems that sooner or later are going to [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=721.88s)]
*  erupt. So did Israel have a right to occupy in the first instance? [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=727.12s)]
*  Did Israel have a right to kick those people out in 1948 in the second instance? [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=731.48s)]
*  I mean, you can go on and on and on. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=735.64s)]
*  The people in Gaza are 80 percent refugees from the areas that Hamas invaded on the [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=737.32s)]
*  7th of October. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=743.96s)]
*  So it really depends on where you start and where your perspective is on this. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=745.64s)]
*  If you assume that everything was peaceful and this is France and Germany or this is [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=749.88s)]
*  country A and country B, where country A simply decides to launch a murderous assault on [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=756.08s)]
*  the civilians of country B, then of course country B has the right to counterattack. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=760.96s)]
*  But this is not country A and country B. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=767.52s)]
*  This is an occupier and an occupied population. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=769.24s)]
*  And this is a settler colonial project where the people living in settlements around the [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=772.1600000000001s)]
*  Gaza Strip are living on lands that used to belong to people who are now have now been [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=777.4000000000001s)]
*  living or their ancestors, their parents and grandparents have been living as refugees in [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=783.36s)]
*  the Gaza Strip since 1948. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=787.8000000000001s)]
*  And you have to factor that in. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=789.52s)]
*  Does an occupying power have the right to attack an occupied population? [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=792.08s)]
*  You should be asking, I think, those kinds of questions as well as the question, what [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=796.24s)]
*  should Israel have done? [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=800.32s)]
*  Israel shouldn't have been in occupation of the West Bank in the Gaza Strip in the first [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=801.36s)]
*  place. It should have there should have been a Palestinian state. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=805.12s)]
*  There should have been any number of things should have been the absence of which have [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=808.12s)]
*  led to this horrific situation that we're in, where at least 800 Israeli civilians have [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=812.44s)]
*  been killed, at least 450 or more Israeli soldiers and security personnel have been [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=817.64s)]
*  killed. And apparently over 15000 Palestinians, both civilians and militants have been [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=822.4399999999999s)]
*  killed. And we're not at the end of it. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=828.52s)]
*  I mean, assuming that this ceasefire breaks down over the next several days, we're going [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=830.1999999999999s)]
*  to see many, many much higher casualty. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=834.1999999999999s)]
*  And I think at the end of this, you'd have to ask that question. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=836.52s)]
*  What was achieved? [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=839.4399999999999s)]
*  What was the point of this? [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=841.04s)]
*  Have they stored up more enmity for Israel? [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=842.76s)]
*  Have they improved Israel's position? [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=844.96s)]
*  Are Israelis more secure as a result of killing 15000 Palestinians, including a [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=847.0s)]
*  huge number of children and women and other noncombatants? [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=854.2s)]
*  I don't think the answer is yes. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=857.88s)]
*  I don't think you achieve security in that fashion. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=859.96s)]
*  And I'm not just saying that from an Israeli perspective. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=862.84s)]
*  I would say that from a Palestinian perspective as well. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=865.12s)]
*  Sooner or later, there has to be a political resolution of this. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=868.96s)]
*  I don't think we're nearer to a political resolution as a result of this. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=872.24s)]
*  Not only, I think, because of whatever happened on the 7th of October, but because [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=875.64s)]
*  of the 15 times greater toll that has so far been inflicted by Israel since the 7th [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=881.12s)]
*  of October. And that toll will only, unfortunately, probably increase. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=886.72s)]
*  I'm always amazed at the ability for Western media outlets and governments to just [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=891.72s)]
*  define history however they want. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=897.52s)]
*  They did the same thing with the Russian invasion of Ukraine. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=899.28s)]
*  They just pretended that the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the West began on [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=902.88s)]
*  February of 2022, as opposed to having extended many years back, without which you [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=906.72s)]
*  can't possibly understand what happened in February of 2022. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=912.36s)]
*  And of course, the attempt to pretend that there was no conflict until October 7th. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=915.12s)]
*  And it all started when Hamas invaded Israel. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=919.6s)]
*  But your answer essentially says that the way for Israel to the best thing for Israel [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=922.6s)]
*  to do from its own perspective, from the perspective of morality and legality, is to [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=929.8000000000001s)]
*  resolve the underlying conflict so that there's no more motive for Palestinians to attack [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=933.88s)]
*  Israel. The standard argument, which I am interested in hearing your view on, is that [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=939.1600000000001s)]
*  Hamas has made very clear they don't want a two state solution. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=943.36s)]
*  The reason Netanyahu propped up Hamas was precisely because he thought they would work [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=947.0400000000001s)]
*  symbiotically to prevent a two state solution so that wouldn't resolve the hostility of [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=952.28s)]
*  Hamas, say, Israel defenders. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=957.4s)]
*  And then more interesting, I think I want to ask you, is a two state solution possible [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=959.28s)]
*  given the extent of the settlement project in the West Bank? [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=965.8000000000001s)]
*  I mean, my short answer to the second part of your question is no, unless you deal with [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=971.48s)]
*  occupation and colonization, you should not even utter the words two state solution, a [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=975.08s)]
*  two state solution in which Israel continues to settle or in which 750,000 Israeli [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=980.48s)]
*  citizens maintain their residence and their colonization of Palestinian lands is not a [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=985.4s)]
*  two state solution. It's a one state solution with a one state, one Bantustan solution. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=991.12s)]
*  A situation in which Israel continues its occupation is not a two state solution. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=996.1999999999999s)]
*  And every Israeli offer, generous offer, has included Israeli control of the Jordan River [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=999.72s)]
*  Valley, which means it's not a state. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=1004.68s)]
*  I mean, imagine if a foreign country controlled the border with Mexico and the border with [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=1006.64s)]
*  Canada, would we be a sovereign state, the United States? [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=1010.4s)]
*  Of course not. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=1012.76s)]
*  Your your the first part of your question. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=1014.24s)]
*  I think that you have to look at this in terms of how you end this conflict. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=1019.08s)]
*  Do you end it in a fashion which maintains a structural inequality where one group has [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=1030.72s)]
*  rights and security at the expense of the rights and security of the other, where one [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=1037.96s)]
*  group proclaims, as the Israeli nation state law proclaims, that only the Jewish people [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=1043.3600000000001s)]
*  have the right of sovereignty in the land of Israel? [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=1049.92s)]
*  Or do you have a solution, whether it's a one state or a two state solution, in which [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=1053.6000000000001s)]
*  both peoples and every individual have equal rights? [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=1058.92s)]
*  How you do that, I don't know. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=1062.24s)]
*  I don't think that a two state solution is possible in present circumstances because [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=1064.0s)]
*  nobody's talking about the elephants in the room. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=1067.52s)]
*  Nobody's talking about ending Israeli security control. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=1069.96s)]
*  Nobody's talking about ending settlement. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=1072.1599999999999s)]
*  And if you don't do that, even if the Palestinians accept the measly 22 percent of [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=1073.96s)]

*  Israelis out of there or figure out how you how they continue to live heavily armed [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=1089.76s)]
*  Israelis, heavily armed Israeli settlers backed by major components of the IDF, if not [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-tG-VwYGo&t=1094.52s)]
