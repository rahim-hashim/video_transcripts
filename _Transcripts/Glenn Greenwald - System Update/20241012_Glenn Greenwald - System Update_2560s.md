# "It's Just Horrific": Israel's Destruction of Gaza Chronicled in New Documentary
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [October 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg)
*  Richard, thank you so much for taking the time to talk to us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=0.0s)]
*  Congratulations on this very important documentary, and we are excited to talk about what went [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=9.08s)]
*  into it and everything else. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=14.24s)]
*  So we're delighted to have you. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=15.8s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=18.8s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=19.8s)]
*  Sure. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=20.8s)]
*  So as a journalist, there's been a lot of things I've covered that have been really [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=21.8s)]
*  awful to write about, but then also to witness. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=27.08s)]
*  And I know in the past, once I feel like I have an understanding of the extent of the [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=31.2s)]
*  horrors and suffering entailed by whatever I'm writing about, I almost find myself wanting [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=36.4s)]
*  not to look anymore, just because it almost seems like gratuitously suffering. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=41.879999999999995s)]
*  And there have obviously been a lot of people watching and talking about and reporting on [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=50.68s)]
*  the atrocities that have been taking place in Gaza over the last year. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=55.92s)]
*  This film, I think, does a remarkable job of synthesizing it, of putting it into a whole [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=59.96s)]
*  narrative, but a lot of it is extremely difficult to watch. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=66.04s)]
*  So what is it that you feel that this documentary adds that people who have been following all [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=69.48s)]
*  along maybe haven't quite gotten yet? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  Well, if you've been following it all along on a Western media, I think it adds an awful [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=78.68s)]
*  lot. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=85.12s)]
*  I mean, for people who've been following it on the sort of sites and news outlets that [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=86.12s)]
*  you and I perhaps follow, then as you say, I think it synthesizes it and brings it all [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=90.44s)]
*  together. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=95.56s)]
*  I think it was inspired by two things. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=96.96s)]
*  One is the desire simply not to leave the space to Western media outlets to cover this [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=98.96s)]
*  because they do it so appallingly, but also this realization that there was this extraordinary [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=104.4s)]
*  resource out there. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=109.24s)]
*  You had this extraordinary phenomenon of Israeli soldiers posting videos of themselves continuously, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=110.28s)]
*  which were completely candid. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=116.96000000000001s)]
*  They seemed to have no sense of shame and a complete sense of impunity. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=118.76s)]
*  And it struck us this was a quite extraordinary and unique source for being able to tell the [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=123.76s)]
*  story of a conflict. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=128.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=129.44s)]
*  And I want to get into that a lot because obviously I know when defenders of Israel [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=130.44s)]
*  hear that Al Jazeera has any role in anything, they immediately dismiss it as unreliable [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=134.16s)]
*  or anti-Semitic. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=139.16s)]
*  You know, all the accusations that get hurled, but in this particular case, so much of what [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=141.04s)]
*  you're reporting relies not upon even necessarily Gazans or critics of Israel, but about what [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=145.48s)]
*  IDF soldiers themselves have said and shown about their own conduct in the war. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=152.32s)]
*  And I want to get to that in just a second, but before I get to that, there was a woman [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=157.2s)]
*  in Gaza who is a journalist with Al Jazeera and she described the last year as being, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=162.24s)]
*  quote, the first ever live streamed genocide. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=168.4s)]
*  And I think clearly beyond what the IDF has shown, one of the differences in this war [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=172.28s)]
*  as compared to almost any other is the Israelis tried to keep journalists out. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=177.52s)]
*  The ones that were there, they tried to kill, but they couldn't prevent real time videos [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=182.16s)]
*  taken by the people there. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=188.12s)]
*  How much of that did you rely on and how were you able to confirm that what you were seeing [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=190.04000000000002s)]
*  was in fact what was reported to be shown? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=194.32s)]
*  Yes, so we rely quite heavily on Al Jazeera footage. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=198.6s)]
*  Al Jazeera has been in there all this time and filming, so we rely very heavily on their footage. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=202.64000000000001s)]
*  You're right, we do rely on stuff shot by Palestinians in Gaza. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=208.4s)]
*  I mean, unlike the BBC and ITV, I think here in Britain, we don't start from the presumption [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=214.64000000000001s)]
*  that they're trying to get one over on us. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=220.44s)]
*  You just have to look at that footage and they've set up the most extraordinary movie set, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=224.04s)]
*  if it is false. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=230.16s)]
*  Now, there are one or two videos you censor a little bit contrived. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=231.64s)]
*  And we have Palestinians working on the team who are very tuned into these things. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=236.12s)]
*  And we filtered out a few. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=241.6s)]
*  But on the whole with those, if you're looking at a ruined landscape and shredded bodies, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=244.51999999999998s)]
*  I don't know what else you're looking at but the truth. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=250.20000000000002s)]
*  Before we get into the substance, let's talk a little bit about the film, how it was produced, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=255.8s)]
*  who was behind it, who financed it. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=259.36s)]
*  Because whenever there's a film that in any way reflects negatively on Israel, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=261.0s)]
*  not just a film but a report or any kind of document of any kind, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=265.32s)]
*  there's immediately an attempt to discredit it as some kind of propaganda against Israel. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=269.92s)]
*  Can you talk a little bit about who worked on this project, who financed it, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=275.92s)]
*  where it came from and who kind of oversaw it? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=280.32s)]
*  Okay, so I made it. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=285.68s)]
*  I'm a freelance journalist. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=286.96s)]
*  I've made about 60 films for British television, primarily for Channel 4 but also the BBC. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=288.4s)]
*  I've made a lot of dispatches for Channel 4. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=294.15999999999997s)]
*  People who worked on it is the superb team at the Investigative Unit at Al Jazeera. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=297.0s)]
*  So Al Jazeera funded it. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=301.08s)]
*  It's an Al Jazeera production. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=302.08s)]
*  Specifically the Investigative Unit. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=304.28s)]
*  And some excellent freelancers we brought in as well. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=306.52s)]
*  One of the things that called my attention to your work in particular, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=311.52s)]
*  to your involvement in this, is that a lot of times people who are willing to be so [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=313.96s)]
*  harshly critical of the Israeli military or Israeli policy are people who are, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=319.4s)]
*  in some sense, already kind of marginalized. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=324.4s)]
*  They're people who are already on the fringes. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=326.55999999999995s)]
*  They don't have a lot to fear. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=328.32s)]
*  One of the things that's so notable about your work, your body of work over many years, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=330.28000000000003s)]
*  is that as you just got done saying, you've done a lot of your work for some of the most [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=334.6s)]
*  mainstream and well-regarded media institutions in the UK. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=338.48s)]
*  For those who don't know, Channel 4 News is among those. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=342.44s)]
*  Obviously the BBC, the Daily Telegraph, many of these institutions that are among the most [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=346.28000000000003s)]
*  mainstream and established in the UK are ones with which you've had a relationship. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=350.84000000000003s)]
*  Did you think about, and I'm sure you did, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=355.24s)]
*  but what were your thoughts about what possible implications there might be for your career [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=357.64s)]
*  or for your standing inside the British media world by having overseen a documentary of this kind? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=363.56s)]
*  It's true. If you step out of the, frankly, very peculiar consensus there is about Israel in the West, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=371.08s)]
*  you do come to be regarded as a marginal figure. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=377.2s)]
*  And it's quite tricky when you're trying to pick people to interview, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=380.24s)]
*  because you track people down and you talk to them and think they're very interesting. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=382.88s)]
*  Then you suddenly discover they're regarded as very marginal. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=387.08000000000004s)]
*  Andreas Krieg, who we interview in our film, a fascinating man, a security expert, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=389.76000000000005s)]
*  he was on the BBC last week saying the same sort of things he said to us, just sort of rational analysis. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=395.64000000000004s)]
*  And it provoked an absolute firestorm. He was heaped with abuse and so on. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=400.88s)]
*  In terms of myself, well, Al Jazeera is continuing to employ me for the moment, so we'll see how it goes. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=407.0s)]
*  One of the things that I'm always interested in is sort of the idiosyncrasies of Brazilian political, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=414.8s)]
*  rather British political culture, because it goes back so many years. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=421.56s)]
*  It has a lot to do with centuries old animosities between various countries, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=425.64s)]
*  a residue of the British Empire in a way that I think a lot of people outside the UK, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=430.2s)]
*  certainly in the US, don't quite fully understand. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=435.24s)]
*  And there has been over the last several years, things involving Jeremy Corbyn [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=438.76s)]
*  and other incidents like that, very clear expressions of just how strong the pro-Israel consensus in the UK is, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=443.48s)]
*  not just in the Labour Party, but in the Tory party and just in the general media establishment as well. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=454.04s)]
*  Why is that? Why is the UK so devoted to and intense about defending Israel or justifying what it does? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=460.28000000000003s)]
*  It's interesting you put that point. I don't think it's worse than America, it's certainly not worse than Germany. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=472.6s)]
*  I think it's a broader question, and I think it's a fascinating question. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=477.92s)]
*  Why is the Western media political establishment so enthralled to this very small and very questionable country? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=482.24s)]
*  And I think one of the fascinating things here, and here I can speak for Britain specifically, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=492.68s)]
*  there's a problem in Britain generally at the moment that the media political class, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=498.52s)]
*  which is very much a club in Britain at the moment, is very out of touch with the general public. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=501.96s)]
*  You just have to analyse the figures in elections and so on. There's a real problem there. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=506.84s)]
*  But it's massively out of touch on this issue. So you watch British media, you listen to British politicians, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=511.15999999999997s)]
*  and yes, you would think Britain is a sort of slavishly pro-Israel country. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=516.04s)]
*  You look at the opinion polls and that's not the case at all. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=519.16s)]
*  And what support there is for Israel is deteriorating sharply. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=522.52s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, just one more question on this before I have a lot of questions about the substance of the film. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=528.4399999999999s)]
*  Most of them are about that actually. But before we delve into that, I just want to ask you on that last question. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=534.12s)]
*  Obviously, there have been books written about what's called the Israel lobby, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=539.4s)]
*  including by very respected scholars like John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=543.88s)]
*  who were the first to, I think, really kind of have the courage to document it, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=547.4s)]
*  one at Harvard, one at the University of Chicago. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=551.56s)]
*  But there's been a lot of revelations about the ability of pro-Israel activists to kind of influence [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=554.92s)]
*  mainstream political parties in the West far beyond what their numbers might suggest they're able to do. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=564.28s)]
*  Oftentimes, this is a taboo topic. People like to write it off as anti-Semitic. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=570.68s)]
*  And it can actually, I think, fall into that trap at some point. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=574.76s)]
*  But in terms of the UK and other places, what role do you think that plays in that question you raised, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=580.2s)]
*  namely, why is it that the West is so enthralled with and so devoted to this kind of tiny little country on the other side of the world? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=586.36s)]
*  Well, the first of the three films I've made for El Jezira was the second episode in The Labor Files, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=594.6s)]
*  where we picked apart this whole extraordinary anti-Semitism crisis around Jeremy Corbyn, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=599.0s)]
*  who was a radical left leader of the Labor Party. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=603.8000000000001s)]
*  And there I very much came to the conclusion, yes, the Israel lobby is very powerful. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=607.16s)]
*  The thing was there, it tapped into the vested interests of a whole range of groups. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=612.1999999999999s)]
*  I mean, there were an enormous range of groups, most particularly the security establishment [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=616.4399999999999s)]
*  that really, really didn't want Jeremy Corbyn to be prime minister. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=620.52s)]
*  And the Israel lobby is powerful, but it ain't that powerful. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=624.68s)]
*  And these groups all came together, essentially. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=628.1999999999999s)]
*  And it was the perfect weapon to beat him with because it left him, you know, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=631.48s)]
*  he was a man who spent his life combating racism, and it rather left Jeremy Corbyn disarmed. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=634.6s)]
*  He appeared to be totally powerless to fight back against it. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=642.0400000000001s)]
*  And it proved an immensely effective weapon. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=645.08s)]
*  Not that I think an awful lot of people were very puzzled by it. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=647.72s)]
*  They didn't really get why Jeremy Corbyn was supposed to be an anti-Semite. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=651.4s)]
*  What they did get, though, was that the Labor Party had this problem. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=657.24s)]
*  It was being criticized day after day, and it wasn't pushing back. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=659.72s)]
*  It was doing this mea culpa and sort of squirming around. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=662.2s)]
*  And what people got was there was a problem and the Labor Party couldn't solve it. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=665.32s)]
*  And it was a very effective weapon to destroy Jeremy Corbyn. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=668.84s)]
*  So yes, you have the Israel lobby, people who are intent on pushing the interests of Israel [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=673.4000000000001s)]
*  and delegitimizing the Palestinian cause. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=678.84s)]
*  Very often, because the people they are targeting are the radical left, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=681.24s)]
*  or increasingly just the broader left, then there are other people who have a very [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=685.32s)]
*  vested interest on jumping on that bandwagon. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=689.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think the way Jeremy Corbyn responded, instead of kind of being very aggressive [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=692.2800000000001s)]
*  and rejecting the idea or even showing a great offense that he is anti-Semitic [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=697.24s)]
*  or would tolerate anti-Semitism, instead constantly feeding into it like, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=702.6800000000001s)]
*  yes, there's a problem, but I'm fixing it, I'm working on it. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=706.76s)]
*  Unintentionally, but very much in line with Corbyn's character, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=711.0s)]
*  I think is a big part of what enabled that to succeed. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=714.12s)]
*  But that's for another day. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=717.48s)]
*  All right, let's get to this documentary, some of the more specific [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=718.44s)]
*  aspects of it. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=722.36s)]
*  Although I began by saying I think people paying attention to this [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=723.72s)]
*  intently and not just through the Western press might have known a lot about it, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=727.8000000000001s)]
*  even though this documentary, watching it all at once, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=731.5600000000001s)]
*  kind of gives you a newfound sense of just how extreme these sufferings and atrocities have been. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=734.44s)]
*  One of the things that I felt like was new was a lot of the information about what these, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=740.2800000000001s)]
*  quote unquote, evacuation orders entail. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=745.08s)]
*  We were constantly hearing, almost as though it was like a humanitarian thing, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=747.56s)]
*  that the IDF would order civilian populations to evacuate the area they were about to attack. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=753.0s)]
*  And in the West, that got depicted as, oh, look, the IDF does something that no other [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=758.4399999999999s)]
*  military does, which is it warns the civilians about where the bombing is coming and it tells [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=763.16s)]
*  them to leave. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=767.3199999999999s)]
*  And yet a lot of these, quote unquote, evacuations were not just extremely arduous, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=768.52s)]
*  but themselves very violent, very deadly, very brutal. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=772.68s)]
*  Can you talk a little bit about what it is that this film was able to reveal about [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=776.68s)]
*  just that part of it? [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=781.8s)]
*  But it's very, very vivid, isn't it? [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=782.84s)]
*  Because it's a specific evacuation. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=785.48s)]
*  There have been so many evacuations, but there's a specific one where we focus on. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=787.64s)]
*  Now, right at the beginning of the war, the Israelis ordered everyone to leave northern [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=792.28s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=795.88s)]
*  A lot of people didn't. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=796.6s)]
*  They couldn't or they didn't want to or whatever. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=797.8s)]
*  Now, when you then get the Israeli ground invasion at the end of October, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=800.36s)]
*  the situation becomes untenable for a lot of people, including people we interview in [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=804.76s)]
*  our film. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=808.76s)]
*  That includes Yumine El-Sayed, the Gaza correspondent of Al Jazeera English, also a young [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=809.4s)]
*  journalist, Mohammed Al Helou. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=814.92s)]
*  And they both flee at that time. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=817.3199999999999s)]
*  And they paint. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=819.0s)]
*  It's an extraordinary, vivid portrait, isn't it? [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=820.1999999999999s)]
*  And there's the pictures to accompany it, which are obviously always so important with [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=823.64s)]
*  television, of these great columns of people being forced. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=827.16s)]
*  The resonances of this are so awful. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=832.0400000000001s)]
*  These great columns of people being forced to walk along with their hands in the air, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=834.0400000000001s)]
*  holding white flags, holding their identity cards in the air. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=838.9200000000001s)]
*  Mohammed says, if you drop something, you weren't allowed to bend down to pick it up. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=842.36s)]
*  You couldn't look to the left or the right. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=845.48s)]
*  You had to keep walking straight forward. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=846.6800000000001s)]
*  And the children had to walk with their hands in the air. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=848.36s)]
*  And there's pictures of that. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=851.0s)]
*  And yes, that made quite a profound impression on me. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=852.76s)]
*  Yes, and as Mohammed says in the film, Mohammed Al Helou, these weren't safe corridors. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=858.12s)]
*  As you walked along them, you could see the bodies on the ground. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=862.52s)]
*  They weren't safe. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=864.84s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think just on that issue alone about what these evacuations entailed, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=866.68s)]
*  this film does provide a lot of new information, even for people who are paying close attention, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=870.76s)]
*  because on some level, I think the evacuation seemed like almost benign compared to what [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=875.08s)]
*  everything else that was happening. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=879.4s)]
*  And then when you see the reality of what those entailed, they turned out to be anything [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=881.0s)]
*  but benign. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=885.08s)]
*  Another thing that was new to me, and yet resonated a great deal because I have worked [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=886.6800000000001s)]
*  on this issue for a long time, was that the Israelis used artificial intelligence in order [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=893.08s)]
*  to assign different values to different people based on a whole variety of metadata about [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=900.76s)]
*  who they speak to, where they go. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=907.0s)]
*  And then they would assign points and they would basically would decide who they could [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=909.0s)]
*  kill based on that. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=912.36s)]
*  This came from an investigation from the Israeli journal 972 that you credited based on interviews [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=913.56s)]
*  with Israeli sources. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=919.16s)]
*  I remember back when I was doing the Snowden reporting, one of the things that alarmed [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=920.52s)]
*  me the most that we were able to report on was that the US military was using a much [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=923.88s)]
*  cruder version at the time of kind of assigning numerical values to people based on who they [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=927.4799999999999s)]
*  were speaking with. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=933.56s)]
*  And a lot of journalists, including Al Jazeera journalists, ended up at the top of the list, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=934.3599999999999s)]
*  not because they were terrorists, but because they tend to talk to people the US considered [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=938.8399999999999s)]
*  militants because they're journalists. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=942.84s)]
*  And the ability to just kill people based on numerical assignments with no real human [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=944.76s)]
*  judgment is beyond dystopic. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=950.76s)]
*  It's the sort of thing you might expect in a scientific film set 250 years now. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=953.32s)]
*  And yet it's something the Israelis are using to a great extent. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=957.4s)]
*  Can you talk about what it is that you were able to learn about how the Israelis identify [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=961.72s)]
*  who they think should be assassinated? [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=965.96s)]
*  As you say, Glenn, we credit 972 magazine, very good radical Israeli magazine, English [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=968.76s)]
*  Language magazine. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=976.2800000000001s)]
*  They'd done the research. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=977.08s)]
*  They had all the sources. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=977.88s)]
*  The Israelis have denied this, but I have to say they haven't denied it terribly convincingly. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=979.32s)]
*  And I think you've described it there as absolutely terrifying. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=982.84s)]
*  They scrape all the intelligence they can about you, a lot of it coming from your phone, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=985.72s)]
*  and including which other phones you've been near and so on. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=990.76s)]
*  If you pass a certain number, then you can be killed. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=995.3199999999999s)]
*  And the horrifying thing is there's then this second bit of AI, which is called Where's [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=999.3199999999999s)]
*  Daddy, which is basically where are you? [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1003.4s)]
*  Because they're going to kill you when and how and where. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1005.4s)]
*  And it's much easier to kill people at home. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1008.28s)]
*  So where's daddy when daddy's home? [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1011.16s)]
*  That's when you kill him. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1012.76s)]
*  And of course, you can have everyone else in the house as well. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1013.4799999999999s)]
*  I've got to say during those first perhaps two or three months, it seems to me that this [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1016.12s)]
*  AI system is simply providing the thinnest of veneers for what is essentially a punitive [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1021.56s)]
*  slaughter. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1028.04s)]
*  I think it's as near as damn it random, the bombing the Israelis are doing for the first [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1028.84s)]
*  two or three months. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1035.24s)]
*  Well, I want to get a little bit into that. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1037.0s)]
*  And by the way, just to emphasize this, Where's Daddy name itself is so creepy. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1039.3999999999999s)]
*  And we have seen so many instances of not just where journalists or suspected militants [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1044.04s)]
*  were killed, but their entire families were wiped out precisely because their homes were [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1052.52s)]
*  targeted. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1056.76s)]
*  I mean, we've seen so many of those. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1057.24s)]
*  And actually, one of the examples was an Al Jazeera journalist who had been working almost [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1059.16s)]
*  every day on reporting what was going on, only then discovered, I believe while he was [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1064.2s)]
*  about to go on air or shortly after he came off the air, that his home had been targeted [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1068.36s)]
*  while he was working. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1074.04s)]
*  And most of his entire family had been either killed or severely wounded. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1075.3999999999999s)]
*  Can you talk a little bit about that case? [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1080.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1083.1599999999999s)]
*  Well, this is while Dato and he was the bureau chief for Al Jazeera in the Gaza Strip. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1083.3999999999999s)]
*  And the horrific thing there is his family had done what they were told. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1091.0s)]
*  They had evacuated. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1094.6s)]
*  They'd left the northern zone. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1095.56s)]
*  They'd crossed the Wadi Gaza. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1096.76s)]
*  They were in Nusrat refugee camp, which was in the supposed safe zone. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1098.28s)]
*  And the building they were in was directly targeted. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1103.16s)]
*  He lost four close family members. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1105.4s)]
*  A son of his was then who was a cameraman was later killed as well. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1108.6000000000001s)]
*  One of the most disturbing things that is included in the documentary that we've heard as well [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1115.96s)]
*  is how often people who were speaking out on social media or reporting for established [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1121.56s)]
*  news outlets like Al Jazeera were receiving direct threats over their telephones and over [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1128.52s)]
*  their texts from identified Israeli intelligence or military officials basically saying, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1134.04s)]
*  we know who you are. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1140.6s)]
*  We know where you live. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1141.4s)]
*  And if you continue to do this, we will end up killing you or you better evacuate your family. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1142.68s)]
*  What is it that you were able to find out about those sorts of things in the documentary? [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1148.52s)]
*  Well, Yomla El-Sayed, the Al Jazeera English correspondent, actually tells the story of her [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1154.6s)]
*  husband gets a direct call on his mobile phone from a private phone number and they clearly [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1161.48s)]
*  know who he is and they're telling him to get out and leave at a time when he can't [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1168.84s)]
*  possibly get out and leave. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1172.28s)]
*  There's bombardments all around. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1173.32s)]
*  But Yomla speaks very powerfully about this, as does Maha Husseini from Euromed, [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1175.48s)]
*  Human Rights Monitor, another remarkable interviewee we talk to who is still in the Gaza Strip. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1181.24s)]
*  It means you're carrying this terrible burden. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1187.64s)]
*  You're terrified for yourself, but you're terrified for your family. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1191.5600000000002s)]
*  Indeed, you're terrified for everyone around you. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1194.28s)]
*  And everyone around you is aware that you are a threat because you're likely to be a target. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1196.52s)]
*  It's a very simple thing. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1200.68s)]
*  When journalists had to finally leave Gaza City and were moving into Khan Yunis and Derry [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1202.28s)]
*  Bala and so on, they often had to pay a premium for property because landlords really didn't want [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1207.8s)]
*  to rent property to journalists. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1214.6000000000001s)]
*  You began by describing this kind of indiscriminate attempt on the part of the Israelis just to [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1219.4s)]
*  avenge what they believe happened on October 7th, what did happen October 7th, to avenge [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1225.24s)]
*  it through what the documentary calls purposely disproportionate force as a way of reestablishing [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1230.2s)]
*  fear of the Israelis or a deterrent. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1236.44s)]
*  So there was this kind of deliberately indiscriminate destruction on the one hand. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1238.1200000000001s)]
*  And then on the other, we know of a lot of cases of prominent Palestinians, prominent Gazans who [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1243.8s)]
*  were active on social media, who were journalists, who ended up being killed as well. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1249.56s)]
*  Did you walk away convinced that the Israelis were in fact targeting prominent critics of the [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1254.28s)]
*  Israeli war effort in Gaza as opposed to just having these people die as part of this indiscriminate [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1261.48s)]
*  violence? [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1266.76s)]
*  Yeah, there's no question people are being targeted. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1268.44s)]
*  I mean, you just have to look at the circumstances of the deaths of some of our Al Jazeera [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1270.3600000000001s)]
*  personnel. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1276.76s)]
*  And it's absolutely clear they're being targeted. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1277.24s)]
*  Yeah, they're sort of hunted down. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1279.32s)]
*  One of the bizarre features of this war, and you cover it in your documentary, and it's [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1285.0800000000002s)]
*  actually so bizarre that even Donald Trump, in the course of making clear how supportive [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1290.28s)]
*  he was of Israel, actually criticized this as well and said Israel needs to put a stop to this, [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1295.16s)]
*  is just how many degenerate, sadistic, gratuitously cruel, creepy videos have been [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1300.3600000000001s)]
*  posted, not by a few Israeli soldiers here and there, almost systematically, [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1309.4s)]
*  to the point where they were getting celebrated in the Israeli culture for it. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1314.76s)]
*  One of the components of this that the film delves into a little bit, and I'm just interested in [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1322.2s)]
*  your understanding of why you think this happened, is how much of an obsession there was with kind [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1327.96s)]
*  of a psychosexual humiliation. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1332.6000000000001s)]
*  In particular, a lot of these videos involve rifling through the lingerie drawers of women [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1335.0s)]
*  whose houses they were ransacking and destroying, showing this lingerie, often wearing it. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1342.36s)]
*  And there's a lot of scenes posted by the Israelis themselves of deliberate [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1349.88s)]
*  psychosexual humiliation of the kind, for example, that we saw in Abu Ghraib, [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1354.84s)]
*  which the U.S. government kind of wrote off as an aberration and punished the people involved, [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1359.0s)]
*  even though I think that turned out to be untrue. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1362.84s)]
*  Do you think that in general when young people, young men and women are trained to go and [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1368.28s)]
*  invade another country and kill them and are trained to dehumanize them, this is a natural [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1375.3999999999999s)]
*  outcome of that kind of training? Or do you think there was something particular about [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1381.1599999999999s)]
*  the Israeli military that led them to do these specific sorts of things in what seemed like a [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1385.9599999999998s)]
*  quite common and disproportionate way? [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1393.32s)]
*  Well, you know, let's not be naive. Soldiers behave badly, you know. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1396.36s)]
*  And I think what's extraordinary about this is that there's been no attempt to control the [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1399.9599999999998s)]
*  production and publication of these videos. That's what's astonishing. So the soldiers [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1406.84s)]
*  behave as if they have a complete impunity, but the high command behaves as if it has [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1412.6s)]
*  complete impunity. That is what is really extraordinary, that they keep being posted [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1418.44s)]
*  online without the commanding officers being at all worried. Now, does that simply reveal [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1423.0s)]
*  them behaving like normal soldiers? I suspect they are worse than normal soldiers. You know, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1428.76s)]
*  this is a society, you know, which is built on the subjugation and dispossession of Palestinians and, [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1436.1200000000001s)]
*  you know, the dehumanization of Palestinians is the psychological prerequisite of that. And that [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1446.68s)]
*  goes back long, long before October the 7th. I think then October the 7th served to legitimize [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1451.16s)]
*  a lot of the nastiest, darkest emotions within Israeli society. But also, as I say, I think [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1457.4s)]
*  what often stops young men in particular behaving very badly in combat situations is good command. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1467.0800000000002s)]
*  I mean, that's part of the point of officers and particularly ground level officers. I mean, [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1471.48s)]
*  it's one of the problems Hamas had on October the 7th, was they had this sort of catastrophic [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1475.24s)]
*  success. And once they had that success, they didn't have good ground level commanders. That's [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1479.24s)]
*  why, you know, many very serious human rights abuses are committed on October the 7th. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1484.1200000000001s)]
*  What seems to be extraordinary, as I say, with the Israeli soldiers is their officers are not [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1490.44s)]
*  exerting any control and indeed can very often be seen joining in these videos. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1498.04s)]
*  One of the things that has, I guess, confounded me in the last year or so is that Israeli abuses and [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1502.84s)]
*  war crimes and indiscriminate violence is absolutely nothing new. But for a long time, [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1512.04s)]
*  the Israelis cared a lot about presenting a positive face, especially to the West, that [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1518.04s)]
*  Western support, not just of governments, but of populations was very important to them. The IDF [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1526.6s)]
*  was constantly called the world's most moral army. They were very boastful of their extreme [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1531.96s)]
*  military discipline and ensuring that immoral acts of this kind don't actually happen. It seems to [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1538.4399999999998s)]
*  me, and I'm wondering what you think, that in some sense, the Israelis have almost stopped caring. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1545.72s)]
*  I mean, like I said, even Donald Trump, who has been running his campaign based on almost a kind [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1551.6399999999999s)]
*  of let's make Israel great again platform, said the one thing that the Israelis have to stop doing [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1558.28s)]
*  is allowing these soldiers to post these horrific videos online because it makes them look terrible [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1563.96s)]
*  and they haven't been punished. There's been no attempt to stop it. It's as if the Israelis don't [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1568.36s)]
*  really care anymore. The Israelis seem to be instead saying, we're going to do whatever we want [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1572.04s)]
*  and we don't think there's anyone in the world, particularly in the West, who can stop us. And [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1577.56s)]
*  maybe they're right about that. Have you perceived a change in their mindset, the leadership's [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1582.36s)]
*  mindset about the extent to which they care or don't care about how they're perceived in the West? [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1587.16s)]
*  They're extraordinary. When Donald Trump thinks you're behaving like a crass idiot, [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1592.92s)]
*  then that really is quite extraordinary. I mean, don't overstate the degree to which [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1596.52s)]
*  before October the 7th, Israel was a responsible moral army that cared about how it was seen in [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1600.68s)]
*  the West. I mean, just take a single incident, the murder of our journalist Shuri Nabuakle [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1606.44s)]
*  in the West Bank. I mean, they've been granted extraordinary indulgence and leeway for decades, [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1611.8s)]
*  but I think it has increased to a whole other level after October the 7th. And I think they're [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1620.28s)]
*  doing it because they can. I think Israeli foreign policy, to a degree, is very, very simple. Israeli [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1626.68s)]
*  foreign policy consists of one thing, what can we get away with? And what they've learned over the [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1634.04s)]
*  last year is that it's astonishing what they can get away with, and they're now doing it to Lebanon. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1639.32s)]
*  The question of what the Israeli motive has been in terms of what they're doing in Gaza since October [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1644.76s)]
*  7th has been one that has been well debated, I think, among a lot of Israeli critics. And typically, [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1654.2s)]
*  trying to debate motive is very difficult. It's like, why did the US invade Iraq? Why did the [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1661.56s)]
*  UK go along? Probably there's different interests inside the government. You can't really reduce it [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1665.8s)]
*  to just one motive or another. Different actors have different motives. But I want to focus on [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1670.76s)]
*  one just so that we can set it aside, which was the main one offered, namely that we're doing what [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1677.0s)]
*  we're doing because we want to save the hostages or get our hostages back. And the fact that that [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1681.24s)]
*  could be said with a straight face, it was repeated so often in Western media, was always so astonishing [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1688.28s)]
*  to me because as several people in the film said, if you wanted to save your hostages, [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1693.0s)]
*  the last thing you would be doing is indiscriminately bombing the place that you know they're being kept [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1699.16s)]
*  or starving on purpose the place that you know they're being kept. And a lot of Israeli hostages [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1703.8s)]
*  who were released from captivity said that by far their biggest fear was not Hamas, but was dying in [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1708.28s)]
*  an Israeli airstrike. Why do you think something so facially ridiculous that, oh, we're doing this [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1712.92s)]
*  in order to get our hostages back while we're bombing the entire place we know that they are, [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1721.48s)]
*  was taken so seriously by Western media? Well, I mean, this is something we don't do in our film. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1725.64s)]
*  The Israelis often make denials or give explanations for things, which are just absolutely [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1737.08s)]
*  very, very obviously flatly contradicted by the facts on the ground. And this is one of the [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1743.24s)]
*  exasperating things about watching, for example, the BBC, where you will have an overwhelming mass [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1747.88s)]
*  of evidence about something. You'll have a very puny, rather absurd denial by the Israelis. And [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1753.8000000000002s)]
*  the two things are given equal weight. So yes, I mean, why, and this ties into a broader cognitive [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1759.3200000000002s)]
*  dissonance the West has about Israel, that it treats it as if it is a serious Western democracy, [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1767.3200000000002s)]
*  which it isn't. I mean, particularly the government that currently runs Israel, [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1773.24s)]
*  it's an extreme right wing. Certainly many members of the government are extremely right wing [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1777.0s)]
*  and overtly racist. So, you know, why the BBC solemnly repeats without scrutinising more of [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1782.76s)]
*  the things these people say, I don't know. In terms of what the game plan is, yes, I mean, [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1792.04s)]
*  it was obvious from the very beginning and quickly became obvious to the families of the hostages [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1795.72s)]
*  that Netanyahu did not give a damn about their safety. So what is the game plan? Now, again, [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1800.44s)]
*  I mean, I, you know, I'm long enough in the tooth that I picked apart in minute detail [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1807.0800000000002s)]
*  the Iraq wars and the Afghan wars. You know, sometimes people just do really dumb things. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1812.28s)]
*  You know, they just do sometimes. Now, is there a strategy? Is there a plan? [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1817.3200000000002s)]
*  I think what we can see absolutely clearly, and again, you wouldn't really grasp this from [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1824.2s)]
*  watching Western media, is they plan to depopulate the area to the top half of the strip, the area [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1829.16s)]
*  to the north of the Wadi Gaza. I was at an event last night where Younna El-Sayed, the Gaza [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1835.88s)]
*  correspondent for Al Jazeera, she was saying that she thinks the Egyptians are going to be bullied [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1843.4s)]
*  slash bribed into effectively opening the border and shepherding an awful lot of these people [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1849.5600000000002s)]
*  into the new settlements in the Sinai desert. I mean, that was Younna's view. I'm not enough of [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1857.48s)]
*  an expert on these things, but it's, you know, it's incredibly bleak to try and look forward [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1864.1200000000001s)]
*  and to see, you know, what is the Gaza strip at the end of all this? What does it consist of? [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1871.32s)]
*  What do the lives of the people who currently live there consist of? Well, you know, [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1878.1200000000001s)]
*  around 180,000 have already left. They have to pay a very big bribe to the Egyptians to get out, [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1881.88s)]
*  but a lot of people have already left. I remember very vividly, and again, I realize motives are [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1886.68s)]
*  difficult to talk about, but I also think they're extremely important to understand why a country [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1892.92s)]
*  or government is doing what it's doing. When there was all that propaganda from the actual [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1896.68s)]
*  Israeli government about saving the hostages and all that or destroying Hamas, Naftali Bennett, [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1902.6000000000001s)]
*  the previous Israeli prime minister, gave an interview in The Economist, and he was asked [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1909.5600000000002s)]
*  about what the Israeli goal is going to be and what it's about to do over the next however many [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1915.4s)]
*  months or years it responds, and he was very candid. He said what Israel is going to do and [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1919.64s)]
*  needs to do more than anything else is to show that it's willing to cross every line that people [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1926.2800000000002s)]
*  think it's unwilling to cross in order to put such fear in the hearts of Arabs around that region, [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1931.64s)]
*  not for the next few years, but for generations, so that they will basically be all terrorized, [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1938.8400000000001s)]
*  subdued into ever again thinking about, as he put it, trying to harm the Jews. That was part of [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1944.36s)]
*  what he was saying was we want to show we're basically a crazy state, that we don't abide by [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1950.6s)]
*  international rules, that we're willing to do anything. The other theory, of course, is one [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1955.0s)]
*  that has been explicitly defended by the current Israeli government, including the more extremist [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1958.9199999999998s)]
*  people in Netanyahu's government, which is saying a lot, which is that we consider the West Bank and [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1964.6s)]
*  Gaza part of greater Israel and we want to flatten Gaza. We want to make it so that the people there [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1970.36s)]
*  have to leave. I have always kind of been a little bit in doubt about what the motive is, [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1977.16s)]
*  but I have to say one of the things that I concluded having watched your documentary, [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1982.12s)]
*  and you see so many Israeli soldiers saying that. I mean they're going on purpose once they order [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1986.6s)]
*  people to evacuate and they're destroying their shops, they're destroying their buildings, they're [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1991.6399999999999s)]
*  destroying their homes, they're destroying their sewage systems, their water systems, [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1995.32s)]
*  and they're explicitly saying look they're going to have nothing to come back to. It seems like [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=1999.16s)]
*  Gaza, if it's not already, is well on the way to becoming completely uninhabitable in a way that [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2003.3200000000002s)]
*  you can't almost even conceive of how it could be rebuilt as a society where Gazans can live. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2010.2s)]
*  What is your view on having delved into this in order to make the film on what the Israelis at [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2015.96s)]
*  the top level, the ones kind of guiding these actions and this policy, are hoping to achieve? [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2022.28s)]
*  As you say, maybe it's just an irrational desire to destroy and kill, but it seems like there's [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2028.68s)]
*  more going on than that. Well, I think to a degree it is a bit like 9-11, that 9-11 was [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2033.8s)]
*  grasped as an opportunity by a lot of people in Washington who had for a long time wanted to do [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2042.28s)]
*  all sorts of things, and that there's clearly an element of that going on. As I say, I think they [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2046.52s)]
*  clearly want to empty the space to the north of the Wadi Gaza, the northern end of the Gaza Strip. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2052.2s)]
*  At the moment, quite grotesquely, the Israelis are using their destruction of Lebanon to distract [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2060.28s)]
*  from what they're doing in Gaza. There is at the moment almost unreported going on the final [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2070.04s)]
*  cleansing of the final pockets of population in northern Gaza and hospitals being closed down [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2075.72s)]
*  and so on. That seems to be quite clear. They don't want any Palestinians north of the Wadi Gaza. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2082.68s)]
*  But also the impulse to annex and settle the West Bank has clearly received an enormous impetus [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2089.16s)]
*  over the last year. Horrific things have been happening on the West Bank. Hundreds of Palestinians [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2098.6s)]
*  have been killed on the West Bank. I don't think the two things, Bennett's comments and [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2103.72s)]
*  the annexation of the West Bank are exclusive. I think they go very, very much hand in hand. But [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2112.68s)]
*  to simply ratchet up the deterrence of terror seems to me in the long run very dangerous. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2119.72s)]
*  I mean, it's always struck me that Israel is a colonial settler state. It just clearly is. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2127.88s)]
*  Israel has always struck me that it's South Africa trying to pretend it's Australia. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2136.04s)]
*  You know, look at where even after almost a century of dispossession, apartheid, [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2140.28s)]
*  ethnic cleansing, half of the population between the river and the sea are Palestinian. And the [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2146.04s)]
*  lesson of these situations throughout history, throughout the world, is people never resign [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2152.6s)]
*  themselves to being second class citizens in their own country. I would invite anyone to spend any [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2159.48s)]
*  time in the West Bank and you get it. You get it immediately. You know, I'm not a particularly [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2165.4s)]
*  aggressive, assertive person, but I could not live like that. You cannot live as a despised second [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2169.96s)]
*  class citizen in your own land. The only way colonial settler countries become permanent is [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2175.64s)]
*  when you exterminate the local population effectively, as happened in North America, [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2181.88s)]
*  as happened in Australia. This is what is so terrifying. These societies carry within them [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2185.88s)]
*  genocidal impulses. And you know, I think to a degree that that's what we're seeing now. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2192.04s)]
*  Just a couple more questions. First of all, did you attempt as part of this documentary to [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2199.88s)]
*  request or obtain any kind of response from the Israeli government about what you were showing [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2206.04s)]
*  and what you were claiming? Oh, yeah. And we always, you know, write a very thorough [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2211.32s)]
*  write a reply to the Israelis and they always ignore us. So what we did, I think we were, [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2216.6800000000003s)]
*  they did reply to 972 magazine. They gave quite a full reply to that. And so we take that. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2223.88s)]
*  Denying that report. They denied that, but also said basically Hamas is a terrorist organization, [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2228.6800000000003s)]
*  which hides behind the civilian population. We are a society and a military that abides by the [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2234.44s)]
*  I mean, that's essentially their argument. Right. Last question. I know this goes beyond the scope [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2241.64s)]
*  of your film, which we're going to very heavily promote and recommend. I've already started to [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2246.44s)]
*  do that. And I will definitely continue to in conjunction with this interview. So just, I want [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2251.72s)]
*  to take the opportunity while I have you to ask, and you mentioned what the Israelis are doing in [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2255.56s)]
*  Lebanon now. And it seems to me like if you compare the first month or month and a half [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2260.44s)]
*  to what the Israelis did to Gaza, it looks a lot like what the Israelis are doing to Beirut, [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2266.36s)]
*  including purposely attacking medical workers and health clinics and hospitals so that the people [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2271.0800000000004s)]
*  who they kill or wound have no place to go to seek out any kind of medical services, obviously [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2277.6400000000003s)]
*  flattening residential buildings and the like. Do you think the Israelis have planned for Beirut [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2285.0800000000004s)]
*  more or less what they have done to Gaza? And if they do, or even if there's something short of [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2291.0s)]
*  do you think the world will stand by and allow it the way they did with Gaza? [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2296.68s)]
*  Well, I think the Americans have made a statement, haven't they? They're saying you don't do to [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2300.7599999999998s)]
*  Lebanon what you've done to Gaza. But it's just horrific that we are in this position. It is [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2304.68s)]
*  unimaginable that any other country would be being granted this sort of license and that you and I [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2311.24s)]
*  are having a conversation about whether the Israelis intend to entirely destroy Southern [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2317.24s)]
*  Lebanon is just breathtaking. And this was one of the reasons for making the film is to bear [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2323.0s)]
*  testimony for history that there were people at this time who could see what was happening [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2329.48s)]
*  and who told the story of what was happening and didn't take shelter in the idea that it's all [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2335.32s)]
*  terribly complicated and nuanced and it's not black and white and so on. I would very much [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2339.88s)]
*  hope the Israelis aren't going to do to Southern Lebanon what they did to Gaza. And I would very [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2346.04s)]
*  much hope that if they try to the West will stop them, but I wouldn't bank on it. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2350.68s)]
*  Yeah, I was about to say it is true that Biden said and spokespeople said we don't want to see [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2355.0s)]
*  and don't expect to see the Israelis due to what they did to Gaza. At the same time, there were a [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2363.3199999999997s)]
*  lot of things that the U.S. told Israel not to do over the last year with respect to Gaza, including [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2367.72s)]
*  when Biden declared as a red line a very meaningful and heavy term for President Hughes for the [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2371.64s)]
*  Israelis to invade Ra'afe, the one of the very few refugee camps that had been somewhat safe. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2378.52s)]
*  And Netanyahu made very clear very quickly that he had no intention of even considering for one [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2384.36s)]
*  second that red line and immediately violated it. The Americans first tried to defend it. Oh, [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2389.0s)]
*  it's just a limited invasion. And then they just gave up on it. So I guess that's what, [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2393.48s)]
*  as grim as it is, I guess I'm not very optimistic about the West's willingness or ability to prevent [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2397.8s)]
*  Israel from doing whatever they want, not just in Gaza, which is pretty much an [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2405.32s)]
*  already done deal, but wherever they want to extend that to. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2409.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, and very importantly, remember in four weeks time, the president of America might be [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2414.1200000000003s)]
*  Donald Trump. But yes, I mean, you have this extraordinary phenomenon that the Israelis just [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2417.6400000000003s)]
*  again and again and again completely humiliate the Americans. I mean, if you're British, you know, [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2423.56s)]
*  I've studied British-American relations in micro detail, going all the way back to Sue Israeli, [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2427.8s)]
*  but particularly the wars of our lifetimes. And our relationship with the Americans is [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2433.32s)]
*  astonishingly imperial. I mean, it's quite strange the way we handle our relationship. We don't [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2438.52s)]
*  really have an independent foreign policy at all. Now the contrast with the way the Israelis treat [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2443.0800000000004s)]
*  the Americans, which is, it really is the ultimate example of the tail wagging the dog. And again, [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2448.76s)]
*  it's just one of these bewildering things. Why did the Americans allow themselves to be treated like [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2453.8s)]
*  this by the Israelis? And I think there's a quote from Bill Clinton in the [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2459.8s)]
*  mid-90s when dealing with the Israelis. And you know, to excuse my language, you know, [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2467.4s)]
*  the quote was, who's the fucking superpower here? And it's America, but you would never guess it to [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2471.0800000000004s)]
*  actually look at the relationship between the two countries. Absolutely bizarre. The US funds the [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2476.36s)]
*  Israeli military, pays for their bombs, pays for their wars. And then the Israelis turn around and [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2480.6800000000003s)]
*  say, we don't care in the slightest what you think is in your interest. We're going to do whatever we [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2485.32s)]
*  want, even if it harms your interest as you perceive it. And the Americans just continue [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2489.0s)]
*  to send more money and more weapons, no matter how often that happens. It is bewildering [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2493.4s)]
*  until you start interrogating the reasons why. Well, once again, congratulations on this [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2499.4s)]
*  documentary. I wish it were a happier and more uplifting documentary, but unfortunately the [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2503.4s)]
*  events don't permit that. Like I said, for me, even as somebody who has followed it, it put [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2508.84s)]
*  together a lot of things that I had already known, but in a different way. And it showed me a lot of [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2513.16s)]
*  things that I actually didn't know. So I can't recommend it highly enough and I'm sure a lot of [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2517.16s)]
*  work went into it. I believe there was probably some personal sacrifice on your part that I want [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2523.08s)]
*  to congratulate you for as well. And I appreciate your taking the time to talk to us. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMu4yNxunAg&t=2528.7599999999998s)]
