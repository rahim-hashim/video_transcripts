# INSANE Israel-First Admission
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [June 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0)
*  It's only been taboo in the United States to suggest that anybody has loyalty to Israel [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=0.0s)]
*  and that that shapes what they advocate in the United States, even though we've long [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=13.88s)]
*  had people who say it. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=19.64s)]
*  And everybody knows it's true. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=21.94s)]
*  When you grow up Jewish in the United States or anywhere in the world, there are Jews in [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=23.84s)]
*  Brazil I know, it's all the same. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=29.46s)]
*  You get taught from birth or pretty much from birth that Israel is a country, even though [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=33.04s)]
*  it's not yours, even if you don't live there, that you owe loyalty and love to. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=37.1s)]
*  That it's extremely important to you as a Jew, no matter what your nationality is, to [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  want to keep Israel protected and strong. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=45.74s)]
*  And there's a lot of people who never reevaluate what they're indoctrinated with from childhood. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=48.86s)]
*  And one of the reasons why it's taboo to say it, one of the reasons why, in fact, the [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=55.16s)]
*  expanded hate speech codes governing anti-Semitism that President Trump is imposing on American [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=59.1s)]
*  campuses prevent you from saying it. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=63.580000000000005s)]
*  It's considered officially anti-Semitic to accuse any Jewish person of having more loyalty [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=65.74000000000001s)]
*  to Israel than to the United States, even if they say it, even if a Jewish person says, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=71.74000000000001s)]
*  look, I am American, but at the end of the day, for religious reasons, for historical [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=75.5s)]
*  reasons, my first loyalty is to Israel. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=79.42s)]
*  Or as happened if a Republican member of Congress has asked if you had to choose between saving [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=83.9s)]
*  Israel or save the United States, which would you choose? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=88.38s)]
*  And he said, look in the Bible, you'll see my answer there, meaning I would choose Israel [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=90.69999999999999s)]
*  first because I believe that's what God wants me to do. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=93.89999999999999s)]
*  Even if a person who's Jewish says it explicitly, you still can't claim it because that would [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=97.82s)]
*  be considered anti-Semitism. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=104.82s)]
*  The problem is that over the last three weeks, two weeks, we've been debating whether the [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=106.02s)]
*  US should enter this war on behalf of Israel, jointly with Israel. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=109.25999999999999s)]
*  We have a lot of people making extremely candid statements that leave no doubt about their [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=112.46s)]
*  loyalties and priorities. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=117.7s)]
*  Senator Cruz, Ted Cruz, told Tucker Carlson, and I'm pretty much quoting verbatim, even [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=119.94000000000001s)]
*  though I don't quote in front of me because I've talked about it so much, I ran for Congress [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=124.5s)]
*  with the stated intention to be the leading defender of Israel in the Congress, and I've [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=129.38s)]
*  woken up every day in order to do that. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=135.1s)]
*  His stated intention was not to help the people of Texas or the United States. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=139.98000000000002s)]
*  He said his stated intention was to be the leading defender of this foreign country and [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=143.78s)]
*  that he wakes up, quote, every day in order to do that. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=147.9s)]
*  Last night, President Trump's State Department spokesperson, Tammy Bruce, longtime Fox News [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=151.86s)]
*  personality, which is where President Trump got a lot of his cabinet from. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=158.74s)]
*  He watched Fox News all day. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=162.42000000000002s)]
*  There's a New York Times story out today claiming that one of the reasons he wanted to become [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=163.9s)]
*  involved in this war is because Fox News that he was watching after the Israelis' attack [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=168.82s)]
*  said it was a huge success. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=172.57999999999998s)]
*  It was an incredible operation, and then Trump the next day said, I did this. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=175.14s)]
*  I approved it. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=179.1s)]
*  We joined it together and started talking about the wars, if it was his and not even [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=180.1s)]
*  the Israelis anymore. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=182.57999999999998s)]
*  So he watches Fox News all the time. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=183.57999999999998s)]
*  That's how he knows Tammy Bruce, found Tammy Bruce. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=185.85999999999999s)]
*  She's one of those people who we claim she used to be a liberal or a Democrat. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=189.26s)]
*  She talks all the time that she's a lesbian, so she's gay. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=193.18s)]
*  She used to be a Democrat, and she realized the left was so bad, the liberals were so [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=196.82s)]
*  bad, she didn't leave the left. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=199.45999999999998s)]
*  Left her, the Dave Ribensnick. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=201.18s)]
*  And that's how she became a Fox News personality and how she's a standard conservative. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=203.3s)]
*  She was being interviewed by 24 News in Israel last night, and this is what she said. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=206.82000000000002s)]
*  The pride of being able to be here and do work that facilitates making things better [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=214.66000000000003s)]
*  for people and in the greatest country on earth, next to Israel. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=220.66000000000003s)]
*  It's an honor to be able to make a difference and to be able to speak in this regard with [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=227.54s)]
*  an administration that I love so much and that I feel genuinely represented by. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=233.54s)]
*  It's a real honor. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=241.94s)]
*  Now I have heard my entire life, from the time I can remember, just being as young as [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=243.57999999999998s)]
*  any memories that I retain, being told that the United States is the greatest country [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=249.2s)]
*  on earth by far, that we should be so grateful to live in the United States. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=254.74s)]
*  It's not only the greatest country on earth by far, it's the greatest country ever to [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=258.06s)]
*  exist in all of human history. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=261.86s)]
*  It's incredibly improbable that a person would be born into not just the greatest country [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=264.90000000000003s)]
*  on earth for the moment, but the greatest country ever to exist in all of human history, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=268.98s)]
*  but that's what we're taught. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=272.42s)]
*  I don't know how many times I heard that. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=273.42s)]
*  I always thought that was a little strange, like wow, that's like hitting the lottery. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=276.22s)]
*  Like the probability of that is very small, but that's what we're taught to believe. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=279.34000000000003s)]
*  I've never once heard anyone, especially an official of the United States government, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=284.09999999999997s)]
*  say that we're the greatest country on earth next to Israel. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=289.38s)]
*  And next to could mean alongside of, but typically in that formulation, next to means after. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=293.62s)]
*  Vanilla is my favorite flavor next to chocolate. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=303.7s)]
*  Eating chocolate is the real thing, but vanilla is my second favorite. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=306.53999999999996s)]
*  I mean, we're saying, oh, she was just being polite. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=309.22s)]
*  She was talking to Israeli media. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=313.38000000000005s)]
*  I want to know how those people who are defending that would react if Joe Biden's State Department [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=316.70000000000005s)]
*  spokesman Matthew Miller or Jake Sullivan were giving an interview to Qatari television [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=321.74s)]
*  and said, look, I'm so grateful to the United States because next to Qatar, it's the greatest [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=327.02000000000004s)]
*  country in the world. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=331.5s)]
*  United States is the greatest country in the world next to Qatar. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=332.98s)]
*  You think you're like, oh, yeah, that's just normal diplomatic politeness when you're talking [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=336.42s)]
*  to a foreign. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=341.06s)]
*  The only way that's acceptable is if you say that about Israel. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=343.14000000000004s)]
*  Tammy Bruce issued a statement today because this viralized for an obvious reason. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=346.54s)]
*  She claimed, oh, anonymous people on the internet are taking it out of context. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=351.06s)]
*  Almost everybody I saw commenting on this was not anonymous, including myself. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=354.3s)]
*  The person who was the one who alerted the world to this clip was Ken Klippenstein, the [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=359.46000000000004s)]
*  independent journalist who's not anonymous. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=364.02000000000004s)]
*  And she said, if you listen to the full interview, it makes clear that it was taken out of context [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=366.86s)]
*  like what Tulsi Gabbard said about her Senate testimony, even though you go and listen to [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=372.02000000000004s)]
*  what she said, it doesn't change the meaning at all, even though she said it exactly the [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=376.5s)]
*  same way in that written report that I showed you. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=380.02000000000004s)]
*  So I went and looked at the full Tammy Bruce interview. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=383.18s)]
*  It's like 10 minutes long. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=385.5s)]
*  And I swear to you, this is how it begins. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=386.5s)]
*  The reporter says, Ms. Bruce, I'm so honored to talk to you. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=388.86s)]
*  I've seen your social media over the years and you are passionately devoted to Israel. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=393.98s)]
*  You really understand the importance of Israel. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=398.74s)]
*  I presume you're Jewish. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=401.38s)]
*  Are you Jewish? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=402.38s)]
*  You're Jewish, right? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=403.38s)]
*  And she said, actually, I'm not Jewish, unfortunately. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=404.58000000000004s)]
*  I'm Italian, she said. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=409.86s)]
*  I'm not Jewish. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=411.38s)]
*  Unfortunately, I wish I were Jewish. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=412.38s)]
*  I mean, so I'm so sad I'm not Jewish, but I wish I were. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=413.58000000000004s)]
*  And she's Italian and she went on to tell a story about how it was either after 9-11 [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=417.58s)]
*  or October 7th, she went to her jeweler and she ordered a custom-made Star of David that [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=422.14s)]
*  she intended to wear as a pendant around her neck as a necklace. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=429.12s)]
*  And supposedly her jeweler said to her, Tammy, you should really think about this twice because [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=432.78s)]
*  it's dangerous to be Jewish in America now. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=439.9s)]
*  Nothing's more dangerous than being a Jew in America. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=442.82s)]
*  You walk on the street and you're Jewish. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=444.94s)]
*  Good chance you're going to be not just assaulted but murdered. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=446.7s)]
*  An epidemic, as we've been told for two and a half years now. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=449.97999999999996s)]
*  And so this jeweler said to Tammy Bruce, I think you should be more careful. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=454.78s)]
*  If you wear that, people are going to think you're Jewish and that's very dangerous. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=457.65999999999997s)]
*  And Tammy Bruce said, that's exactly why I'm doing it. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=462.14s)]
*  I want people to think I'm Jewish. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=465.21999999999997s)]
*  That was the whole ethos of the interview. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=467.98s)]
*  And so when she got to the point where she said the United States is the greatest country [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=471.36s)]
*  on earth next to Israel, it's exactly what it sounded like. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=473.62s)]
*  Here is Stephen Goldstein, who's an operative and Democratic Party activist. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=478.82s)]
*  And the New York City mayoral race is taking place tonight. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=487.22s)]
*  And there's no question. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=491.66s)]
*  There you, let's put that Twitter bio on the screen just so people can see how he describes [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=493.58s)]
*  himself. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=497.98s)]
*  Stephen Goldstein. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=498.98s)]
*  Here you see the rainbow flag in his bio at the end. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=499.98s)]
*  But he describes himself this way. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=503.34000000000003s)]
*  The first thing, passionate Zionist, sensible central liberal, civil rights lawyers with [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=504.5s)]
*  200 laws passed, TV producer with 10 Emmys, Harper Collins Arthur, what might I become? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=511.38s)]
*  So this New York mayoral race is going to be won either by this Muslim candidate, Zoran [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=517.58s)]
*  Mamdani, who is of Indian descent but was born in Uganda. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=528.46s)]
*  And he's Muslim and a critic of Israel. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=535.26s)]
*  And anyone who's Muslim and a critic of Israel, no matter how law abiding they are, no matter [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=537.98s)]
*  how well spoken they are, no matter whatever, that automatically gets interpreted as some [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=545.0600000000001s)]
*  existential threat to Jewish people. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=549.1800000000001s)]
*  In London, Sadiq Khan is the mayor. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=552.14s)]
*  He's Muslim and he's depicted as, oh, Jews can't live in London because of Sadiq Khan. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=556.06s)]
*  And Sadiq Khan is just like a completely banal technocrat, completely centrist labor figure [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=561.9s)]
*  because he's Muslim and has criticized Israel in the past. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=568.54s)]
*  I mean, he's going to put Jews in concentration camps. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=571.14s)]
*  Now the problem for a lot of Democrats like this is that the only other option for Zoran [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=575.2199999999999s)]
*  Mamdani to win in practice, there's eight candidates, but the only two who have a chance [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=579.5s)]
*  are Mamdani and Andrew Cuomo. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=584.9s)]
*  As you might recall, Andrew Cuomo was forced to resign the governorship just four years [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=587.6999999999999s)]
*  ago in disgrace, in part because he lied about COVID in nursing homes, but more so because [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=591.9s)]
*  he had multiple women accusing him of sexual assault, sexual harassment, sexual assault. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=596.66s)]
*  His brother, Chris Cuomo, then got fired from CNN because he was plotting with him, his [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=604.3199999999999s)]
*  brother, as to how to discredit the women. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=607.9399999999999s)]
*  He demanded they do things like get vaginal tests, and feminists were disgusted. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=612.5s)]
*  And Bill Clinton, another honored member of the Democratic Party, also recently endorsed [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=619.18s)]
*  Andrew Cuomo. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=622.9s)]
*  Bill Clinton has been incredibly accused of sexual assault for sure, sexual harassment, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=623.9s)]
*  and even rape. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=629.14s)]
*  These are the two Democratic Party heroes. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=630.14s)]
*  They ruined people's lives for years, Democrats did. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=631.78s)]
*  On this Me Too movement, believe women. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=635.9s)]
*  Any woman who said a guy was kind of creepy in the way he dated, they were destroyed. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=638.5s)]
*  Now the entire Democratic Party establishment is aligned behind Andrew Cuomo. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=645.42s)]
*  The sex pass, the sexual harasser. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=649.78s)]
*  And here's Steve Goldstein saying what his dilemma is about that, because as a feminist [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=653.42s)]
*  he of course hates Andrew Cuomo, but his priorities are clear. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=657.34s)]
*  This is what he said, quote, I wish the New York City mayoral primary had different candidates [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=661.14s)]
*  As a feminist who helped to pass several pro-women laws, I'm well aware of the issues [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=666.0s)]
*  with Andrew Cuomo. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=670.8s)]
*  Look at how gently he phrases that, the issues with Andrew Cuomo. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=671.8s)]
*  But Zoran Mondani is an existential threat to the Jewish people. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=675.72s)]
*  Cuomo over Mondani in what's now a two-person race. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=682.0s)]
*  He's gone around, I'm a liberal feminist, I have this LGBT thing and this rainbow flag [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=687.04s)]
*  thing in my bio. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=690.28s)]
*  And as much of a feminist as I am, there's issues with Andrew Cuomo, meaning a history [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=691.28s)]
*  of chronic sexual harassment and trying to destroy the reputation of the women just like [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=697.3199999999999s)]
*  Bill Clinton did. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=700.3199999999999s)]
*  But he's saying as much as I care about that, feminist issues and not having them harassed [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=703.3199999999999s)]
*  and assaulted, the much bigger issue for me is Israel. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=707.68s)]
*  Not having a Muslim mayor. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=711.74s)]
*  Can you imagine the derangement it takes to say that Zoran Mondani is an existential threat [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=712.74s)]
*  to the Jewish people? [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=719.0799999999999s)]
*  What else is he going to do as mayor of New York? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=720.08s)]
*  Is he going to give Iran a nuclear bomb? [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=721.84s)]
*  Is he going to open concentration camps and put all the Jewish residents into those concentration [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=724.5600000000001s)]
*  camps? [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=732.5200000000001s)]
*  Is he going to withdraw protection from synagogues or even maybe attack synagogues? [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=733.5200000000001s)]
*  This is derangement of the highest order. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=737.72s)]
*  But so many people have as their number one priority, loyalty to the state of Israel or [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=741.1600000000001s)]
*  the belief that everything has to be done to accommodate the unique victimhood of Jewish [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=747.04s)]
*  people that over the past three weeks they've been forced to just admit it explicitly, including [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=752.28s)]
*  a very influential United States Senator who's run for president, Ted Cruz, President Trump's [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=757.7199999999999s)]
*  State Department spokesperson. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=764.5799999999999s)]
*  It's all over the place. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=766.64s)]
*  And I always think candor is healthy. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=768.98s)]
*  It's been clear this is the case for a long time. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=771.12s)]
*  And the reason there was a taboo on it is precisely because it's true, but it's damaging [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=774.76s)]
*  to say. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=779.04s)]
*  And people have now gotten to the point where they don't care anymore. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=780.88s)]
*  After what Israel did over the last 19, 20 months in Gaza, after the censorship that [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=784.4399999999999s)]
*  we've been subjected to on our college campuses by the US government in the name of protecting [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=788.4s)]
*  Israel from criticism, deporting people who are in the country legally, who are very high [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=792.92s)]
*  achieving students, productive student, law abiding student, people with a green card, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=797.56s)]
*  whose wife is American. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=800.92s)]
*  The US government tried to deport them after running on a campaign of deporting illegal [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=804.84s)]
*  people into their country illegally. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=809.04s)]
*  These people entered illegally because they criticized Israel. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=810.24s)]
*  People got to the point where they were like, wait a minute, why is everything about Israel? [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=813.04s)]
*  And now obviously with this war, the same thing, and these people are forced to come [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=817.52s)]
*  out and admit this. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=821.16s)]
*  And once they start admitting it, which they've now done, it's just going to break the dam. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=822.8s)]
*  And I think that statement by Ted Cruz, I ran for Congress with the stated intention [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=826.88s)]
*  to be the leading defender of Israel, a foreign country, in Congress, and I've woken up every [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=831.8000000000001s)]
*  day to do that, is going to be remembered as a very important moment precisely because [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=835.88s)]
*  it made it impossible to keep this off limit, to banish it, to make it taboo when people [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=840.52s)]
*  in power are just coming out, not only in making it clear with their actions, but making [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=845.72s)]
*  it clear with their own words. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=849.36s)]
*  And I think that's an important disinfectant. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=851.88s)]
*  Sunlight is always a disinfectant. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=854.76s)]
*  And that's the priority of many people, which it is, better to have them admit that openly [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=857.0s)]
*  than to pretend it's not true and to try and destroy and punish people who observe it. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnhHIiE6rM0&t=861.56s)]
