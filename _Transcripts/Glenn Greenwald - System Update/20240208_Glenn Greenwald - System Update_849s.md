# Shocking IDF Social Media Videos Mock Gazansâ€”Expose New Atrocities
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [February 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0)
*  Speaking of this war, the one in Israel, not the one in Ukraine, we've covered that quite [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=0.0s)]
*  extensively. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=10.52s)]
*  Again, I think that whether you want the United States to continue shovel billions of dollars [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=11.52s)]
*  to Israel to fuel this war, to fuel the destruction of Gaza, it is our responsibility to tell [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=17.78s)]
*  you about what actually is taking place in Gaza so you can decide whether or not you're [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=24.44s)]
*  in support of it. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=28.16s)]
*  I mean, informing you about a war that you support or that you oppose is fundamental [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=29.88s)]
*  to a journalist. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=34.56s)]
*  So that's what we're going to do. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=35.56s)]
*  First of all, here from the New York Times on February 6th, and I'd like to remind you [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=37.16s)]
*  that the New York Times editorially supports the Israeli war in Gaza. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=41.76s)]
*  They think the Israelis are justified in light of October 7th from having invaded Gaza, from [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=46.72s)]
*  having bombed Gaza. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=51.260000000000005s)]
*  The New York Times is pro-Israel. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=52.260000000000005s)]
*  It has always been a pro-Israel newspaper. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=53.56s)]
*  Everyone believes the media is biased against their own view. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=56.44s)]
*  So hardcore Israel supporters will tell you, oh, the New York Times hates Israel. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=61.059999999999995s)]
*  Really? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=65.2s)]
*  Why is it then that the editors of the New York Times, the owners of the New York Times, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=66.46s)]
*  which is the Salzburger family, the editors of the New York Times, which have generally [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=70.34s)]
*  been not always now, but for most of its history, Jewish editors who are pro-Israel, have editorially [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=75.16s)]
*  always supported Israel, supported USA to Israel, and supported the Israeli wars, including [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=81.52s)]
*  the war currently taking place in Gaza. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=86.24s)]
*  That's the official editorial position of the New York Times they published, editorials [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=89.39999999999999s)]
*  supporting that. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=92.32s)]
*  That's the truth. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=93.52s)]
*  That's the undeniable fact. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=94.52s)]
*  And what they published yesterday was this, quote, what Israel soldiers' videos reveal, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=97.32s)]
*  cheering destruction and mocking Gazans. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=102.6s)]
*  I've seen a lot of these videos myself. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=106.64s)]
*  You see them every day on TikTok, and they circulate on Twitter and elsewhere of Israeli [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=108.28s)]
*  going into little stores, little gift shops in Gaza and mocking them and destroying them, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=115.2s)]
*  stealing things, and then blowing them up, blowing up schools, blowing up universities, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=123.48s)]
*  blowing up little stores, blowing up homes, and laughing and mocking the Palestinians [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=127.92s)]
*  whose civilian life they're destroying as they do it. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=132.8s)]
*  Quote, an analysis of social media videos found Israeli soldiers filming themselves [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=135.84s)]
*  in Gaza and destroying what appears to be civilian property. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=140.28s)]
*  The footage provides a rare and unsanctioned window into the war. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=144.52s)]
*  Quote, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=148.4s)]
*  and [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=170.28s)]
*  inflammatory idea that is promoted by some far-right Israeli politicians, including ones [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=180.4s)]
*  that are high officials in the cabinet of Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=185.6s)]
*  With Israel's war in Gaza under intense scrutiny, many of the soldiers' videos shot in Gaza [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=190.2s)]
*  have fueled criticism. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=194.12s)]
*  One was screened and five others were also cited as evidence in the case South Africa [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=196.0s)]
*  brought to the International Court of Justice, accusing Israel of genocide, a charge Israel [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=199.5s)]
*  has categorically denied. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=203.94s)]
*  In a video filmed on the outscores of Khan Unias in southern Gaza in early January, combat [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=206.14s)]
*  engineering soldiers can be seen smoking hookah pipes before explosions take down residential [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=211.34s)]
*  buildings in the background, then raise glasses to toast each other. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=216.7s)]
*  Here's one of the videos that the New York Times obtained of Israeli soldiers performing [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=221.78s)]
*  theatrically for social media videos that they then posted to social media as they proceed [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=228.7s)]
*  to not only destroy civilian infrastructure and civilian life in Gaza, but celebrate and [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=235.85999999999999s)]
*  mock the Palestinians as they do it. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=239.94s)]
*  Now again, those weapons that they used to blow up the civilian buildings of the entire [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=246.14s)]
*  Muslim World watches are weapons provided by the United States, by you, by American [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=262.46s)]
*  citizens. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=268.18s)]
*  Here's a video of Israeli soldiers acting like disc jockeys and playing music as they [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=269.18s)]
*  destroy things in Gaza. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=276.26s)]
*  Here's what the New York Times says about their study of these videos. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=295.66s)]
*  Quote, in some of the combat engineers' videos, Israeli soldiers mock Palestinians as they [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=299.82000000000005s)]
*  destroy structures and property. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=304.3s)]
*  In others shared widely on social media, soldiers dedicate the destruction of belongings to [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=308.46000000000004s)]
*  the victims of the October 7th attacks and to family members. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=314.82000000000005s)]
*  In one TikTok video, soldiers dedicate the bulldozing of a building to Ayal Golan, an [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=317.98s)]
*  Israeli singer who has been called who has called for the complete destruction of Gaza. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=323.26s)]
*  South Africa cited this video as evidence of what a quote called genocidal speech by [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=327.7s)]
*  soldiers in its case against Israel at the ICJ. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=331.7s)]
*  Here's a third video of the kind the New York Times was describing. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=335.9s)]
*  And again, watch these and make up your own mind. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=339.38s)]
*  Ayal Golan, our dear brother, we love you. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=345.9s)]
*  Team 271 Gaza, Khan Yunis, this house is for you. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=349.02s)]
*  For the joy that you gave us. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=354.97999999999996s)]
*  The nation of Israeli, of Israel lives. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=357.38s)]
*  And as the New York Times said, they were dedicating that to an Israeli singer who had [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=361.38s)]
*  called for Gaza to be turned into a parking lot to be completely destroyed. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=364.82s)]
*  So you can see the mentality of at least some Israeli soldiers in what they're doing. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=368.26s)]
*  So using American weapons paid for by American taxpayers or American loans from China. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=374.38s)]
*  And everyone in the entire world knows that when they watch what Israel is doing in Gaza [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=381.42s)]
*  in their minds, everyone understands, everyone in the world, that it's not just an Israeli [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=385.9s)]
*  war but an American war as well. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=389.9s)]
*  From the London review of books, there's an essay that examines all of the data about [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=393.21999999999997s)]
*  the level and magnitude of destruction that takes place in Gaza and tries to put it into [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=401.18s)]
*  words the remarkable extent of just how much civilian life in Gaza has been irreparably [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=405.78000000000003s)]
*  destroyed. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=412.78000000000003s)]
*  It's a place that's essentially uninhabitable for civilian life, even though 2.2 million [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=413.78000000000003s)]
*  people, half of whom are children, continue to actually exist there for now. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=420.38s)]
*  And it's entitled Rubble from Bone. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=426.1s)]
*  Tom Stevenson writes about Operation Iron Swords, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=428.5s)]
*  Now we know there's allegations that members of the UN Relief Agency participated on October [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=458.5s)]
*  7th. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=471.06s)]
*  This evidence is extremely sparse, and we're going to cover that. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=472.06s)]
*  That allegation, we're looking into it, we're talking to a couple experts that we're going [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=476.9s)]
*  to bring onto the show. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=480.18s)]
*  But even if you believe that because you want to believe that because Israel said it, this [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=481.18s)]
*  does not justify anything of what we are currently covering. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=488.34s)]
*  Quote, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=492.5s)]
*  Palestinian men and boys between the ages of 12 and 70 are stripped, cuffed, blindfolded, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=493.5s)]
*  and loaded onto the backs of trucks to be taken for interrogation. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=497.61999999999995s)]
*  Some have numbers written on their arms. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=501.62s)]
*  Hundreds detained in Gaza have been transported to the desert prison of Qaizout, near the [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=505.34s)]
*  border with Egypt. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=509.85999999999996s)]
*  Others have probably been taken to near-my-military bases. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=511.17999999999995s)]
*  Some men who were taken prisoner in Bayt La'Iya were stripped and transported to fenced-off [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=515.62s)]
*  camps where for days they were tied up, beaten, and tortured. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=520.26s)]
*  Others have disappeared. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=524.34s)]
*  The IDF has subsequently said that between 85 and 90 percent of these detainees were [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=525.78s)]
*  civilians. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=530.38s)]
*  Let me repeat that. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=531.38s)]
*  The IDF, the Israeli Defense Forces, has subsequently said that between 85 and 90 percent of those [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=532.98s)]
*  The UN assessment is that a quarter of the total population is suffering catastrophic [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=541.62s)]
*  famine, 80 percent of the people worldwide currently in that category. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=550.0600000000001s)]
*  Gaza has the highest percentage of people facing acute food insecurity ever recorded. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=555.3s)]
*  The naval blockade could easily be lifted to allow aid to be shipped in. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=562.14s)]
*  Hundreds of trucks of aid and food wait in Egypt but are effectively prevented from [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=565.78s)]
*  entering. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=571.78s)]
*  So all of this ties together. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=574.62s)]
*  There is no way to argue cogently or rationally or truthfully that paying for the war in Israel, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=577.38s)]
*  having the entire world know that we're behind it and are arming it, improves the lives of [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=586.42s)]
*  American citizens. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=592.0799999999999s)]
*  It does the opposite. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=593.26s)]
*  There have been multiple warnings from our own government, from the State Department, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=595.4200000000001s)]
*  advisories saying that it is far more dangerous than ever for American citizens to travel [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=599.94s)]
*  all over the world because the risk of attack, anti-American attack, by people angry that [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=605.14s)]
*  we're paying for the war in Israel, that we're behind the war in Israel, increases the threat [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=611.4200000000001s)]
*  to the lives of American citizens, to our physical security. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=617.1800000000001s)]
*  American troops have been bombed and now killed throughout that region by people angry [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=622.74s)]
*  at the United States for supporting this war in Israel. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=626.52s)]
*  We're going further into debt to finance this war. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=630.3s)]
*  And why? [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=634.78s)]
*  Why are American citizens being subjected to greater harm, physical threats, economic [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=635.78s)]
*  harm, having our military bases attacked, our soldiers killed, all to finance this war [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=639.94s)]
*  that is basically at this point doing nothing but wiping out civilian life? [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=649.5s)]
*  If you claim that you're America first conservative, that you think the government should be prioritizing [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=656.42s)]
*  the interest in the lives of American citizens first, as pretty much the entire Trump movement [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=662.3s)]
*  does, I just want someone, I've been asking for a long time, somebody come on my show [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=667.58s)]
*  who identifies as America first and explain to me how that can be reconciled with having [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=675.08s)]
*  the United States government finance Israel's war, this war, that's doing all of this. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=680.24s)]
*  Especially given the vast difference in the standard of living of millions of Israelis [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=686.88s)]
*  compared to millions of Americans, the fact that Israelis live five to seven years longer [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=691.36s)]
*  than American citizens do. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=696.3s)]
*  I realize that Israel has a lot of intense importance to a lot of Americans for religious [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=700.88s)]
*  cultural reasons. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=707.76s)]
*  And I also realize that a lot of people support Israel because for some reason they've been [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=709.4s)]
*  convinced that the existential threat to the United States is not from the U.S. security [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=713.9399999999999s)]
*  state or from globalist institutions, but somehow are from Muslims, and so they get [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=718.88s)]
*  happy when they see any country killing Muslims and want to have the United States fund it [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=724.4399999999999s)]
*  for their own enjoyment. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=728.26s)]
*  That is not, again, anything having to do with the lives of American citizens. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=731.1600000000001s)]
*  That might have something to do with your psyche, your religious convictions, your cultural [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=735.1800000000001s)]
*  attachments to a foreign country. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=739.34s)]
*  It has nothing to do with improving the lives of American citizens, and that's to say nothing [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=741.62s)]
*  of the morality of financing a war that is more geared to destroying civilian life and [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=745.74s)]
*  has succeeded in killing civilians and imposing enormous amounts of suffering on civilians, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=753.78s)]
*  on children and women and innocent men than any war in this century and arguably any war [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=759.14s)]
*  since World War II. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=765.42s)]
*  It is an atrocity on every level that the United States government not only funds this [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=767.26s)]
*  war but is so desperate as such a top priority along with financing the war in Ukraine. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=773.14s)]
*  We've covered the war in Ukraine. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=780.5799999999999s)]
*  Everything I just said about the war in Gaza and financing Israel applies at least as much [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=781.9799999999999s)]
*  if not more to financing the war in Ukraine. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=787.26s)]
*  Right now, everybody in Congress is focused only on one thing, sending your money not [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=790.4599999999999s)]
*  to improve your lives or the lives of your community or the better of the country, to [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=796.54s)]
*  make it safer, to make it more prosperous, to increase the standard of living or life [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=801.66s)]
*  expectancy. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=806.3s)]
*  They're all desperately fighting with each other over how they can most easily justify [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=807.42s)]
*  sending enormous amounts of money to multiple foreign countries to finance their wars. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=813.02s)]
*  That's the real priority of both political parties in Washington. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgmtxSQWHe0&t=818.5s)]
