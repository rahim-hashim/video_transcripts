# More Epstein SCANDALS Revealed: With Lee Fang
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [May 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0)
*  Let me ask you about this article you wrote in your sub stack. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=0.0s)]
*  We can put it on the screen. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=12.52s)]
*  The title is, Jeffrey Epstein's Dark Legacy Still Clouds the Virgin Islands. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=13.68s)]
*  And you say legal settlements maintain secrecy for Epstein's affairs in exchange for money [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=19.6s)]
*  to counter sex abuse. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=24.060000000000002s)]
*  These local Virgin Island politicians are now tapping the funds for earmarks. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=25.32s)]
*  So I think it's a little bit self-explanatory, but you go into some really disturbing and [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=30.8s)]
*  interesting detail about what these funds that were set up for Jeffrey Epstein's victims [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=35.120000000000005s)]
*  and how much opportunity there was for Virgin Islands officials to profit from their protection [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=40.16s)]
*  that they gave him. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=46.44s)]
*  What is it that you've been finding? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=47.44s)]
*  Yeah, so the Jeffrey Epstein saga is still not solved. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=49.44s)]
*  There are still many unanswered questions. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=54.96s)]
*  Earlier this year in February, the Trump administration promised to release unredacted files. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=57.88s)]
*  The FBI, when they raided Jeffrey Epstein's homes in 2018, they collected CD-ROMs, other [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=63.480000000000004s)]
*  recordings, binders, all these files that remain unreleased to this day. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=71.32s)]
*  They're sitting in a warehouse, the FBI warehouse in Winchester, Virginia, and still nothing [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=75.92s)]
*  has really been released. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=82.32s)]
*  The documents that were supposedly released by the Trump administration were all previously [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=83.88s)]
*  released disclosures. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=87.1s)]
*  There's nothing new there. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=90.08s)]
*  But my story takes a look at the other side of this, where the national media has not [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=91.5s)]
*  really paid attention. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=98.22s)]
*  Many of the most important disclosures about Jeffrey Epstein's political network, how he [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=100.64s)]
*  paid off politicians, particularly politicians in the U.S. Virgin Islands, but also some [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=107.0s)]
*  politicians in the U.S., in the territorial U.S., they were released very suddenly and [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=111.28s)]
*  briefly during a lawsuit in 2023 between JPMorgan and the Virgin Islands. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=118.56s)]
*  Now this sudden disclosure was kind of accidental because the U.S. Virgin Islands was hoping [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=126.0s)]
*  to win some settlement money from these crimes, a form of accountability after his death. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=130.84s)]
*  They really did not expect it, but JPMorgan hit back hard and they counter-sued and alleged [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=137.96s)]
*  that the island officials were far more complicit in Jeffrey Epstein's criminal operations. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=143.44s)]
*  From those disclosures, we got hundreds of emails, depositions, and other documents showing [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=151.64000000000001s)]
*  how Jeffrey Epstein methodically paid off local politicians, customs agents, various [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=156.76000000000002s)]
*  governors, and law enforcement agents to receive exemptions from the sex offender list in the [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=165.32s)]
*  Virgin Islands, to travel back and forth as he was bringing young girls ages between 12 [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=172.0s)]
*  and 15 to his island. Custom agents saw that and looked the other way, they refused to [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=178.04s)]
*  check on their safety. There's really just a litany of red flags he was raising and yet [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=183.84s)]
*  he was paying off politicians to allow him to continue his criminal enterprise. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=189.24s)]
*  This piece kind of looks at how the governor, Albert Bryan, closed that window of disclosure. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=195.11999999999998s)]
*  He quickly settled the lawsuit, he fired the attorney general leading the JPMorgan lawsuit. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=202.67999999999998s)]
*  He later replaced the attorney general with one of Epstein's own lawyers who serves to [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=207.95999999999998s)]
*  this day in the U.S. Virgin Islands. As he promised that this legal settlement money [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=212.2s)]
*  would be used to prevent another Epstein type criminal enterprise by using it to counter [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=217.56s)]
*  human trafficking, sex abuse, and that type of thing. Instead, it's being used as a piggy [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=227.2s)]
*  bank and legislators there don't know exactly how the money's being spent. But for what [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=232.56s)]
*  we do know, it's going to backdated government wages, it's going to vendor payments, it's [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=237.16s)]
*  going to a series of earmarks refurbishing various buildings in the Virgin Islands. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=242.52s)]
*  There's very little transparency in how this money is being used and it's an ultimate irony [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=249.08s)]
*  or perhaps an injustice that the governor who now controls these funds is almost a quarter [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=253.88s)]
*  billion dollars of money was part and parcel to the Epstein enterprise. He was receiving [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=259.0s)]
*  regular donations and gifts from Epstein. He was the one responsible for giving Epstein [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=264.68s)]
*  special tax breaks and then later pushing for his exemption from the sex offender list. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=273.08s)]
*  So while we have this kind of national conversation about the Epstein mystery, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=278.2s)]
*  about the Epstein saga, and it's mostly focused on these documents in Virginia that are held by [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=282.12s)]
*  the FBI, those deserve to be disclosed. But there's still so many unanswered questions [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=288.84s)]
*  and a lack of accountability in the Virgin Islands. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=294.35999999999996s)]
*  It's interesting. For the last four years during the Biden administration, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=297.64s)]
*  the Epstein files, as they've been called, was a major topic on right-wing media, especially [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=304.52s)]
*  independent right-wing media. And two people in particular who are very influential and popular [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=310.84s)]
*  in that realm went around constantly talking about whether Jeffrey Epstein killed themselves, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=316.92s)]
*  the doubts about why we should think that, as well as just bashing the FBI every day [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=322.44s)]
*  for concealing the Epstein files. And those two people were Dan Bongino and Cash Patel, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=329.40000000000003s)]
*  who are now the assistant director and the director of the FBI. And they, I'm sure you saw one on Fox [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=334.12s)]
*  News earlier this week, and one of the questions they got was about the Epstein documents. And the [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=341.64s)]
*  interviewer said, did Jeffrey Epstein kill himself? And they've all said, yes, Jeffrey Epstein [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=346.91999999999996s)]
*  absolutely killed himself. We saw the documents. They were very uncomfortable. But they're saying, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=351.56s)]
*  we saw the documents that prove he killed himself. Well, all of you, including Donald Trump, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=356.44s)]
*  ran on the platform of making the Epstein files public. Why haven't we seen these documents that [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=361.08s)]
*  convinced them of that? But more so, I think the biggest, most interesting question in the Epstein [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=366.28s)]
*  case is, and always has been, was Jeffrey Epstein working with or for foreign intelligence agencies? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=372.36s)]
*  And it's a binary question. Maybe there's more complexity to it. But why is it, do you think, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=379.64s)]
*  that after four, almost five months, four months in office, not just the Trump administration, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=385.88s)]
*  but the very people who kind of built their reputation, in part, on banging the table about [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=392.28000000000003s)]
*  the Epstein files, about crushing and bashing, Christopher Wray and the FBI for not releasing [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=397.32s)]
*  them are now in charge of the FBI, and these documents are still not released. Not a single one [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=402.12s)]
*  that wasn't previously public has been released. Well, we look, we know from, actually, you know, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=408.04s)]
*  I came onto your program last year to discuss our lengthy investigation about why every country [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=414.76s)]
*  that is in influence operations in the U.S. that attempts to change our laws, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=423.32s)]
*  change who gets elected to Congress, affect American policy, there is an effort to enforce [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=427.64s)]
*  the Foreign Agent Registration Act so that they disclose their lobbying activities, except for [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=435.8s)]
*  Israel. There is very ample evidence that the Israeli government, and it's evidence from Israel, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=441.24s)]
*  from Israeli news outlets and from Israeli investigations that show the Israeli government [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=448.12s)]
*  is pouring millions and millions of dollars over the last 10 years into influence operations in [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=453.4s)]
*  the U.S., and there's been a conscious effort to avoid FAR registration. The Epstein saga kind of [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=458.28000000000003s)]
*  raises many two-tier justice questions. One is just generally, broadly, about the rich and wealthy [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=466.68s)]
*  in society because they were working with Epstein, facilitating his crimes. Well, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=474.92s)]
*  many would say that there might be an Israel issue. Actually, interestingly enough, within the J.P. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=482.28000000000003s)]
*  Morgan litigation, the kind of discovery process and some of the exhibits that were filed in the [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=487.88s)]
*  Virgin Islands case, many of the emails between former Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Jeffrey [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=494.76s)]
*  Epstein and some of his associates were disclosed in that litigation in 2023. It was really just an [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=501.64s)]
*  incredible window into Epstein's network. Many other kind of emails of VIP individuals who [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=507.4s)]
*  received help from Jeffrey Epstein, who gave him donations or asked him to, quote unquote, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=514.6s)]
*  manage their money, even though it wasn't clear what he was doing with the money, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=519.96s)]
*  or were traveling to his island or to his New York home. These were kind of details that were [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=523.96s)]
*  ferreted out from the J.P. Morgan case. Perhaps, again, that's why they moved so quickly to settle [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=529.72s)]
*  it, to close that case. But yes, I think just generally, whether it's Israel or another country... [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=535.64s)]
*  Maybe it's Sweden or Nigeria, but we should know. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=542.76s)]
*  We don't know. It could be Finland, really any of those Nordic countries. But [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=548.9200000000001s)]
*  the fact that we don't have these answers and they're sitting on servers, not just with the [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=555.1600000000001s)]
*  FBI, in just this counter suit from J.P. Morgan, they were able to get huge amounts of discovery [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=559.24s)]
*  from Epstein's servers, from his estate, from his associates. He had a close network, Richard Kahn, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=569.48s)]
*  Indyk, Eric Keller-Halls, these three or four individuals who helped arrange many of his [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=577.96s)]
*  financial affairs and helped with the facilitation of his operations. In this one little litigation, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=584.6s)]
*  we were able to see peer into his world if the government wanted to. If this was a priority for [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=593.24s)]
*  either the Biden administration or the Trump administration, they could make it happen because [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=600.9200000000001s)]
*  these emails we know exist. And I think it's worth noting, and this to me is one of the most [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=605.16s)]
*  persuasive pieces of evidence, that when Jeffrey Epstein was convicted in 2010 in South Florida, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=610.12s)]
*  when he was trafficking minors into his home in West Palm Beach to have sex with them and [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=616.12s)]
*  eventually got caught, the U.S. attorney in Miami, Alex Acosta, who eventually ended up in the Justice [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=623.9599999999999s)]
*  Department, is the one who presided over this extremely shockingly generous plea bargain he got, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=630.12s)]
*  where his charges were sex trafficking minors. Everybody who does that goes to prison for a [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=636.4399999999999s)]
*  long, long time. And he basically got something like 12 months, six months in prison, a suspended [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=642.4399999999999s)]
*  sentence, some community service or whatever, and then he was done. And he went back right to [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=648.04s)]
*  cavorting with all the illegalities. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=652.2s)]
*  He got to spend most of it at home, right? He didn't even spend much of that time. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=653.4s)]
*  Right. He started at home. Exactly. Exactly. And Alex Acosta, years later, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=656.2s)]
*  when asked, like, why would you give a sex trafficker of minors such an incredibly light [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=660.04s)]
*  sentence, he basically said, he did not basically said, he said, I was told that he was intelligent [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=666.36s)]
*  and to leave him alone. So there's every reason to believe that he had some connection to foreign [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=672.52s)]

*  Jelaine Maxwell, whose father Robert Maxwell was most definitely a Mossad member, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=686.04s)]
*  Les Wexner, who's the multi-billionaire who made Jeffrey Epstein rich, who has all kinds of [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=690.04s)]
*  ties to Israel. A lot of people try and say, oh, it was probably Qatar, as though they always try [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=694.52s)]
*  and say, like, oh, the country that's really influencing our politics and buying our politics [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=699.08s)]
*  is Qatar. That was something Barry Weiss just published. I have a feeling that if Jeffrey [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=702.9200000000001s)]
*  Epstein were working for Qatari intelligence, that was something we would know and have known [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=706.6800000000001s)]
*  very quickly. And the fact that you have two very hawkish people on the Epstein question, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=710.36s)]
*  Kash Patel and Dan Bongino, who have been running around for years demanding full disclosure, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=717.5600000000001s)]
*  outraged that it's not coming. And now they're suddenly, they're the ones running the FBI. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=722.6s)]
*  And yet there's still not a single document, not one, released that hadn't already been seen. They [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=727.4s)]
*  did that ridiculous, humiliating debacle where they called those right-wing influencers, like [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=732.36s)]
*  Libsip TikTok and others to the White House, and they gave them binders that said, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=737.8000000000001s)]
*  Epstein files set, you know, phase one, and they were all waving around that binder. And it turned [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=741.64s)]
*  out every single document in that binder had been already publicly disclosed long ago. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=745.96s)]
*  It does really start to make you wonder, doesn't it? [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=751.0s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, look, reporting these details has not been easy. You know, some of this is [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=755.8000000000001s)]
*  sourced from just the Virgin Island, from my story, is sourced from the Virgin Island [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=760.36s)]
*  legislature. I talked to lawmakers there. I looked at litigation files, some of which [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=765.3199999999999s)]
*  had never been published, even though there were litigation files from 2023. But also, you know, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=770.1999999999999s)]
*  the Virgin Islands operates in kind of a weird space, you know, to U.S. territory, but they do [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=774.8399999999999s)]
*  not have an online system for just routine campaign finance disclosures. I had to pay [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=781.9599999999999s)]
*  University of Virgin Islands journalism student to go in person and request documents and then pay [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=787.9599999999999s)]
*  an exorbitant fee just to make photocopies and then have those sent to me. You know, reporting [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=794.28s)]
*  this out over the last few months on a story that, you know, really should have been published way [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=799.8s)]
*  earlier was not easy to do. But it's clear that for Cash Mattel and Dan Bongino, you know, they [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=804.8399999999999s)]
*  don't have to do all these kind of extra steps that I engaged in. This is not a question of ability. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=812.8399999999999s)]
*  This is a question of will. Do they have the political will? Do they kind of wear [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=818.12s)]
*  with all to whether the criticism, the kind of pressure from elite groups, potentially [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=824.04s)]
*  intelligence agencies, potentially foreign intelligence agencies, by disclosing this [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=830.12s)]
*  information that could be very harmful to the political and kind of intelligence elite? [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=835.0s)]
*  If your dog is constantly itching and scratching or dealing with hot spots, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=843.0799999999999s)]
*  you know how bad hot spots are for dogs, you've got to check out Code Defense. It's an all-natural [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=848.04s)]
*  solution that's been helping so many dogs. And here's why it caught my attention. I've seen [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=852.68s)]
*  firsthand, I have a shelter where we take care of abandoned animals as well as I have 25 or 26 [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=857.0s)]
*  rescue dogs at home. So I work with dogs all the time and I really do see how often I've seen over [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=863.0s)]
*  the years how they develop these yeast infections, especially in their paws and ears and skin fold. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=867.0799999999999s)]
*  It's not fatal usually, but it can make a dog's life really miserable and it's much more common [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=872.04s)]
*  than people realize. But the usual treatments, things like steroids and antibiotics and apiquel [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=876.92s)]
*  and acidopoietin, they might cover up the symptoms for a while, but they don't really fix the root [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=881.88s)]
*  cause. And in some cases, they actually make things worse over time. Code Defense is different. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=887.24s)]
*  Their daily preventative power works as a dry shampoo, odor eliminator, an anti-itch powder, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=892.36s)]
*  but what makes it particularly unique is that it eliminates yeast naturally by changing the terrain [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=897.64s)]
*  on your dog's skin so that yeast and bacteria can no longer survive. There's no toxic chemicals, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=902.84s)]
*  no synthetic junk, just safe natural ingredients. They also make an aloe-based sensitive skin shampoo [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=907.8s)]
*  that calms irritated skin, preserves the natural oils and microbiome, is totally free of parabens, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=913.88s)]
*  sulfates and anything artificial. Before I ever take an ad or accept a sponsor, especially relating [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=919.0799999999999s)]
*  to dogs, I kick the tires very hard on that. I don't want to recommend anything for anyone's dog [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=925.7199999999999s)]
*  that isn't genuinely helpful, little and harmful. And what makes the most important thing to me is [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=930.8399999999999s)]
*  when I talk to the people who founded the company, they're often dedicated animal lovers, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=935.88s)]
*  and that's the case for the people who founded this company. And I've been really surprised [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=941.0s)]
*  reading the testimonials and seeing their products firsthand. I've heard from so many people that [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=944.6s)]
*  this is the only thing that's worked after years of frustration with dogs finding itch-free and [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=948.12s)]
*  healthy again, and that's why I'm so happy to partner with Code Defense. So if your dog has [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9ZRorksp0&t=952.4399999999999s)]
