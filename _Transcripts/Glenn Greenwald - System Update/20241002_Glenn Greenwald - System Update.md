# Who Is Really Dragging the U.S. Into Israel's Wars?
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [October 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E)
*  You might remember that there's a president of the United States, a sitting president [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=0.0s)]
*  of the United States named Joe Biden. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=10.0s)]
*  And as everybody knows, and it's the reason the Democrats forced him out of the race, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=14.0s)]
*  he's not actually a cognitively functional person. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=18.84s)]
*  He can pull himself together sometimes to like read from the teleprompter, but it's [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=22.44s)]
*  been more than obvious for a long time. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=28.24s)]
*  Americans have known it for a lot longer than the media or Democrats were willing [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=31.52s)]
*  to admit it that Joe Biden is mentally incapacitated and obviously cannot make [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=34.44s)]
*  informed complex decisions about the United States role in all of this. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=39.24s)]
*  And yet he did appear yesterday at the White House where he was asked to comment [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=43.8s)]
*  on what the Israelis are doing in invading Lebanon. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=50.36s)]
*  And he made his views as clear as Joe Biden in his current mental state can [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=54.64s)]
*  possibly make them listen to what he said. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=61.64s)]
*  The fact that Israel may be now launching a limited operation into Lebanon. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=64.44s)]
*  Are you aware of that? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=68.28s)]
*  Are you comfortable with their plans? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=69.12s)]
*  I'm more aware than you might know, and I'm comfortable with them stopping. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=71.16s)]
*  We should have a ceasefire now. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=75.2s)]
*  So that was pretty clear, especially for a politician like Joe Biden, who has [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  spent 50 years reflexively defending Israel almost more than any other [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=84.0s)]
*  politician in Israel. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=87.48s)]
*  You note he was asked about the Israeli involvement, invasion of Lebanon. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=88.8s)]
*  He did not say, I understand why the Israelis are doing it. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=93.52s)]
*  I'm comfortable with their right to self-defense. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=97.36s)]
*  He said, no, I'm not comfortable with that. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=100.88s)]
*  What I'm comfortable with is a ceasefire to stop the Israelis from entering Lebanon. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=103.2s)]
*  So based on that, it seems pretty clear that Joe Biden did not authorize that [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=109.04s)]
*  invasion, did not say that the United States government should support Israel's [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=113.32000000000001s)]
*  invasion of Lebanon, much less get involved heavily and militarily with its [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=118.64s)]
*  own assets in order to facilitate an invasion of Lebanon that Joe Biden, the [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=124.56s)]
*  president, in theory, constitutionally said yesterday, he actually opposes in a [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=128.56s)]
*  pretty angry way at the Israelis. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=134.60000000000002s)]
*  And at some point, who can blame Joe Biden? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=136.64s)]
*  I mean, he's been saying all sorts of things about what the Israelis should [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=138.35999999999999s)]
*  and shouldn't do, and they've been ignoring him in the most humiliating way possible. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=142.6s)]
*  And yet Joe Biden's statement yesterday has almost no connection to or reflection [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=148.0s)]
*  in what has become a U.S. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=157.12s)]
*  policy toward the Israeli invasion, which is the U.S. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=159.72s)]
*  officials are now saying that the Israeli government is not going to [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=163.32s)]
*  support the Israeli invasion of Lebanon. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=166.48s)]
*  And so the U.S. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=168.76s)]
*  officials are actually backing the Israeli military invasion into Hezbollah. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=169.72s)]
*  So you have a president of the United States saying he's not comfortable with [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=175.6s)]
*  this invasion. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=178.44s)]
*  What he's comfortable with is a ceasefire to prevent it. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=179.07999999999998s)]
*  And then somehow people inside the U.S. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=182.88s)]
*  government, unelected people who are unnamed, seem to have just overwritten [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=185.28s)]
*  what he said, as happened many times, by the way, during the Trump presidency too. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=190.95999999999998s)]
*  And then the U.S. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=194.67999999999998s)]
*  military assets removed from Syria and various generals and the CIA tricked him [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=195.64s)]
*  by just kind of moving it around, pretending that they did it, but really [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=201.83999999999997s)]
*  just defying his orders openly. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=204.79999999999998s)]
*  And the media celebrated them for that. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=206.39999999999998s)]
*  And I know it's a conspiracy to suggest that there's a deep state, a permanent [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=210.32s)]
*  power faction in Washington that gets its way no matter the outcome of elections. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=214.83999999999997s)]
*  But this is classically that. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=219.11999999999998s)]
*  Politico, to its credit, asked that question, like, who's making these [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=220.8s)]
*  extremely consequential decisions about what appears to be the increasing U.S. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=225.48000000000002s)]
*  willingness, eagerness, to involve itself militarily in Israel's, not just their [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=231.20000000000002s)]
*  attack on Gaza, which we've been financing and arming and defending and isolating [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=237.16000000000003s)]
*  ourselves from the world to diplomatically shield, but also militarily to be more and [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=240.60000000000002s)]
*  more involved militarily, deploy more military assets to the region, put more [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=244.48000000000002s)]
*  soldiers of the United States in harm's way. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=247.72s)]
*  Given what we just heard from Biden yesterday that I'm not in favor of this [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=249.16s)]
*  invasion, you know the U.S. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=252.32s)]
*  government doing the opposite. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=254.56s)]
*  And so Politico is trying to find out who is it that's running the government? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=257.24s)]
*  A question we've been asking for a long time and are kind of shocked that so few [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=261.76s)]
*  people have. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=265.12s)]
*  This was yesterday in Politico, quote, U.S. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=267.72s)]
*  officials quietly backed Israel's military efforts to get to the border. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=270.08s)]
*  Israel's quietly backed Israel's military push against Hezbollah, quote, the [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=274.88s)]
*  officials urged caution and stressed the need for diplomacy, but the timing was [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=279.8s)]
*  right for such a military shift, they concluded. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=284.8s)]
*  So here you have Joe Biden saying, I'm very concerned about this invasion. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=289.56s)]
*  I'm not comfortable with it. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=294.03999999999996s)]
*  The only thing I'm comfortable with is a cessation of conflict between Israel and [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=295.28s)]
*  Lebanon. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=299.08s)]
*  And on the other hand, you have, quote, U.S. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=300.56s)]
*  officials making the decision that, quote, the timing was right for this invasion [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=304.28000000000003s)]
*  and therefore they are supporting it because, quote, they concluded the time [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=309.52s)]
*  was right to do so. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=314.44s)]
*  Here's the text, quote, Senior White House figures privately told Israel that [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=315.8s)]
*  the U.S. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=320.76s)]
*  would support its decision to ramp up military pressure against Hezbollah. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=321.24s)]
*  Even as the Biden administration publicly urged the Israeli government in recent [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=326.6s)]
*  weeks to curtail its strikes, according to American and Israeli officials. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=330.48s)]
*  Now, that statement alone should be stunning. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=335.68s)]
*  That's a massive scandal that the people of the United States elected to make [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=342.36s)]
*  decisions for the executive branch about war and peace and foreign affairs [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=349.12s)]
*  apparently decided that they don't want this Israeli invasion of Lebanon. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=353.52s)]
*  And yet U.S. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=361.56s)]
*  officials who supposedly work under Joe Biden and are required to carry out his [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=363.76s)]
*  policies and will made a completely different decision, namely that they think [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=371.52s)]
*  the Israelis should be invading Hezbollah or invading Lebanon and that the U.S. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=377.47999999999996s)]
*  should be supporting it. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=382.28s)]
*  Quote, Presidential advisor Amos Hoekstein and Brett McGurk, the White [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=384.23999999999995s)]
*  House coordinator for the Middle East, told top Israeli officials in recent [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=389.96s)]
*  weeks that the U.S. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=393.0s)]
*  agreed with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's broad strategy to [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=394.64s)]
*  shift Israel's military forces to focus on the north against Hezbollah in order [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=399.4s)]
*  to convince the group to engage in diplomatic talks to end the conflict, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=410.52s)]
*  the officials told Politico. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=414.36s)]
*  So just to underscore the point here, Joe Biden, very publicly yesterday, said [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=417.24s)]
*  he's opposed to the Israeli invasion of Lebanon, is very concerned about it and [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=427.68s)]
*  does not want the U.S. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=432.08s)]
*  supporting it, instead wants the U.S. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=433.15999999999997s)]
*  pressuring a ceasefire. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=434.64s)]
*  But somehow these two people who are named here, let me just get that, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=436.84s)]
*  Presidential advisors Amos Hoekstein and Brett McGurk, the White House [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=450.44s)]
*  coordinator for the Middle East, told Israeli officials something completely [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=457.24s)]
*  different than what Joe Biden said, namely that inside the White House, they, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=461.16s)]
*  Amos Hoekstein and Brett McGurk, elected to absolutely nothing, want the Israelis [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=467.16s)]
*  to invade Lebanon and will do everything possible to encourage it. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=473.48s)]
*  The article goes on, quote, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=478.68s)]
*  Drawing opposition from people inside the Pentagon State Department and [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=491.40000000000003s)]
*  intelligence community who believed Israel's move against the Iran-backed [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=495.32s)]
*  militia could drag American forces into yet another Middle East conflict. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=498.72s)]
*  So this is not trivial opposition. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=503.96000000000004s)]
*  You have inside the Pentagon, the State Department and the intelligence [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=507.64000000000004s)]
*  community, deeply concerned that if Israel invades Lebanon and the U.S. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=511.68s)]
*  supports it, that that could drag American forces into yet another Middle [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=516.84s)]
*  East war. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=522.32s)]
*  That's pretty significant. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=525.36s)]
*  And yet somehow all of that was overridden by Hoekstein and McGurk, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=528.48s)]
*  end quote, other top U.S. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=533.6s)]
*  national security officials. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=535.0s)]
*  The article goes on, quote, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=535.96s)]

*  meetings in any sort of a serious way? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=589.48s)]

*  In this question about who exactly these people are inside the White House, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=599.32s)]
*  who seemingly single-handedly disregarded the consensus of the State [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=606.96s)]
*  Department, the military, the intelligence community, and apparently Joe Biden, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=612.5200000000001s)]
*  that supporting the Israeli incursion into Lebanon could lead the United States, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=617.8000000000001s)]
*  drag the United States into a conflict, another Middle East war on behalf of [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=621.2800000000001s)]
*  Israel. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=625.6800000000001s)]
*  And so the question is, can the U.S. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=627.12s)]
*  envoy to the Middle East, an Israeli Army veteran, end the war? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=628.5600000000001s)]
*  So one of the people that Politico says, one of the two, was most responsible for [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=631.84s)]
*  overriding those concerns and signaling to Israel that they should invade Lebanon [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=638.32s)]
*  and that they will have the support of the United States government if they do, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=644.36s)]
*  despite what Joe Biden said as well, is this person, quote, Amos J. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=647.92s)]
*  Hoechstein, who was born in Israel to Jewish parents and served in that [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=652.76s)]
*  country's military, is an odd choice for the U.S. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=657.32s)]
*  to de-escalate tensions in the Middle East, including the Gaza War. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=661.24s)]
*  Oh, do you think that's an odd choice? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=664.12s)]
*  Somebody who was born in Israel and served in the Israeli military, who seems, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=667.64s)]
*  for whatever reason, to have a free hand to override the concerns of most of the [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=675.84s)]
*  U.S. government executive branch and the president that we should not be [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=681.4399999999999s)]
*  encouraging or supporting Israel's incursion into Lebanon because of the [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=685.12s)]
*  very significant chance that the United States could be once again drawn into a [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=688.52s)]
*  new Middle East war. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=694.04s)]

*  branch that is headless, where the president is drooling on a beach and the [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=698.4399999999999s)]
*  vice president is doing nothing but focused on her presidential election, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=703.9599999999999s)]
*  you're going to have these turf wars and somebody's going to emerge victorious, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=707.84s)]
*  someone who the public doesn't even know, let alone elect it, to make the most [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=710.56s)]
*  consequential decisions that a country can make about whether to risk involving [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=714.9599999999999s)]
*  itself in a new war. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=719.1999999999999s)]
*  One of the ironies of all of this is that supposedly the view of the United [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=723.04s)]
*  States is that sometimes it's necessary to use military force in order to make a [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=731.16s)]
*  diplomatic solution possible. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=738.32s)]
*  That's one of the ways the U.S. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=741.6s)]
*  has been justifying the Israeli bombing of Beirut and the incursion into Lebanon. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=742.6800000000001s)]
*  Oh, sometimes you have to use military force in order to de-escalate. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=746.72s)]
*  Sometimes you have to escalate to de-escalate. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=750.8000000000001s)]
*  Sometimes you have to use military force to foster a diplomatic resolution. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=752.44s)]
*  Here was Axios on September 21st expressing this view, quote, U.S. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=755.88s)]
*  fears war in Lebanon, but hopes Israeli attacks will push Hezbollah to a deal, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=761.5600000000001s)]
*  quote, Israeli officials said their increasing attacks against Hezbollah are [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=766.1999999999999s)]
*  not intended to lead to war, but are an attempt to reach, quote, de-escalation [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=770.24s)]
*  through escalation. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=775.4399999999999s)]
*  Kind of like burning down the village in order to save it. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=778.12s)]
*  The official says that the official said Israel believes putting more pressure on [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=782.1999999999999s)]
*  Hezbollah could push the militia to agree to a diplomatic deal that would return [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=785.92s)]
*  citizens to northern Israel and southern Lebanon, irrespective of the deadlock [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=790.28s)]
*  negotiations to establish a ceasefire in Gaza. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=794.8399999999999s)]
*  U.S. officials told Axios they recognize Israel's rationale and agree with it, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=798.16s)]
*  but stress this is, quote, an extremely difficult calibration that could easily [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=802.92s)]
*  go out of control and lead to an all out war. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=807.04s)]
*  Which, not to spoil things, actually is what ended up happening. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=811.88s)]
*  Here is Matthew Miller, the State Department spokesman, a longtime vocal [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=817.8399999999999s)]
*  supporter of Israel when he was on MSNBC, when he served in prior [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=822.64s)]
*  administrations. Now that he's the State Department spokesman, he's pretty much [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=826.3199999999999s)]
*  been the point man every day to stand up and not only defend the Israeli [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=829.48s)]
*  destruction of Gaza, but U.S. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=832.72s)]
*  financing and arming of it. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=834.04s)]
*  And here is what Matthew Miller had to say about the U.S.'s view of the [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=835.88s)]
*  Israeli invasion of Lebanon. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=839.72s)]
*  I think sometimes people either misinterpret or have their own version of [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=846.28s)]
*  what a ceasefire is. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=850.76s)]
*  A ceasefire is not one side in a conflict unilaterally putting down its arms and [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=851.8000000000001s)]
*  stopping the conflict. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=856.8000000000001s)]
*  It is an agreement for both sides to stop the conflict. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=857.8000000000001s)]
*  And in this case, what we have proposed is a 21 day ceasefire where both sides [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=861.84s)]
*  would stop attacking the other and we would reach a diplomatic resolution. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=866.0400000000001s)]
*  And we are going to continue to engage with our Israeli counterparts, with [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=869.08s)]
*  Lebanese counterparts, and with other countries around the world to reach that [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=872.24s)]
*  objective. But at the same time, there are a couple of other things that are [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=876.0400000000001s)]
*  true as well, which is that number one, military pressure can at times enable [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=878.88s)]
*  diplomacy. Of course, military pressure can also lead to miscalculation. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=883.12s)]
*  It can lead to unintended consequences. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=887.48s)]
*  And we're in conversation with Israel about. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=889.44s)]
*  So this 21 day pause or whatever that they were saying they were working towards [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=892.24s)]
*  obviously did not happen. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=896.6s)]
*  But this principle that he defended, that sometimes the only way you can get a [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=898.96s)]
*  diplomatic solution is if you showed that you're willing to use military force [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=904.36s)]
*  and that military force can facilitate a diplomatic resolution. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=908.8000000000001s)]
*  Couldn't one make that exact argument in defense of Hezbollah's shelling of [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=913.2s)]
*  northern Israel and in order to pressure the Israelis to stop bombing Gaza? [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=919.08s)]
*  And there's been a lot of reports that. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=925.88s)]
*  Nasrallah and Hezbollah made very clear to the Israelis that they would agree to [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=929.92s)]
*  a peace, a ceasefire, as long as Israel agreed to a ceasefire in Gaza. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=935.64s)]
*  And when the Israelis heard that, they concluded we're never going to agree to a [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=939.24s)]
*  ceasefire in Gaza. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=943.24s)]
*  They've made that very clear as even the US has tried to pressure them and [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=944.68s)]
*  everyone else unsuccessfully. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=947.3199999999999s)]
*  They want to destroy Gaza and take it over, make it uninhabitable, drive those [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=948.4799999999999s)]
*  people out. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=951.5999999999999s)]
*  That's the real goal, not the hostages or anything else. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=952.5999999999999s)]
*  And the Israelis' officials anonymously said to media, the reason we decided to [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=955.56s)]
*  kill Nasrallah is because he knew he wouldn't accept a peace deal. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=961.4s)]
*  He made that very clear unless we agreed to a peace deal in Gaza, which we're not [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=964.4s)]
*  going to do. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=967.8s)]
*  So this principle, sometimes you have to use military force to facilitate a [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=970.0s)]
*  diplomatic resolution. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=973.36s)]
*  When Matthew Miller was invoking that in defense of the Israeli invasion of [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=975.16s)]
*  Lebanon, isn't that also true, that principle for what Hezbollah was doing? [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=978.4s)]
*  We're going to shell northern Israel in order to put pressure on you to agree to [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=983.2399999999999s)]
*  a diplomatic solution in Gaza. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=988.88s)]
*  And by the way, isn't that also a justification for what Iran did both in [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=991.04s)]
*  April and today? [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=995.76s)]
*  Oh, we won't need to show a little bit of military force just to make clear that [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=997.76s)]
*  we have that capability, not because we want a war, but because that's sometimes [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1000.76s)]
*  the only way to facilitate a diplomatic resolution. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1005.04s)]
*  But as we know, these principles only operate in one direction, sort of like the [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1009.0s)]
*  principle that sovereign countries and their borders are sacred. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1013.0400000000001s)]
*  That principle gets invoked to condemn the Russian invasion of Ukraine, but it [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1018.8000000000001s)]
*  gets instantly disregarded when it's time to justify the U.S. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1024.28s)]
*  invasion of Iraq or the Israeli invasion of Lebanon. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1028.1200000000001s)]
*  And then suddenly borders are not sacred at all and sovereignty absolutely means [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1030.32s)]
*  nothing. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1033.28s)]
*  And while a lot of Americans drowning in Western propaganda and American propaganda [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1034.72s)]
*  also apply these principles in a one-sided way, do you think the rest of [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1039.8799999999999s)]
*  the world is that fooled? [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1043.72s)]
*  Do you don't think they see what the United States does with its power and the [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1044.72s)]
*  way it invokes these concepts when it suits them and it disregards them when it [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1048.8799999999999s)]
*  doesn't? [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1053.2s)]
*  I can promise you the rest of the world sees that. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1055.72s)]
*  Here was Jake Sullivan today, the leader of the United States in the war. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1059.36s)]
*  The national security adviser for the Biden White House, vowing very [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1064.04s)]
*  unequivocally that the United States will absolutely involve itself in this new [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1068.48s)]
*  Middle East conflict in order to defend Israel. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1072.84s)]
*  Thank you. Jake, in April, after Iran struck Israel, the U.S. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1079.6s)]
*  issued a number of sanctions as a consequence. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1085.1200000000001s)]
*  This morning, the president said there will be severe consequences if Iran [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1090.0s)]
*  carried out this attack. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1093.52s)]
*  What are those consequences and are they more severe than sanctions? [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1095.1999999999998s)]
*  Totally legitimate question. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1099.32s)]
*  And that answer will come based on the conversations and consultations we have [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1100.8799999999999s)]
*  with our Israeli counterparts. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1105.6399999999999s)]
*  It's too soon for me to stand before you today and give you an answer. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1107.32s)]
*  What I can tell you is this. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1109.9599999999998s)]
*  We are proud of the actions that we've taken alongside Israel to protect and [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1112.0s)]
*  defend Israel. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1115.4399999999998s)]
*  We have made clear that there will be consequences, severe consequences for [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1116.56s)]
*  this attack and we will work with Israel to make that the case. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1120.08s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1122.84s)]
*  So as always, Israeli wars are American wars. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1124.12s)]
*  We are responsible for them. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1127.6799999999998s)]
*  We pay for them. We finance them. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1128.96s)]
*  We get involved with them. We stand by Israel. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1130.3999999999999s)]
*  We fight with Israel in new wars if we have to, no matter what the rest of the [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1132.12s)]
*  world thinks. Now, by the way, very easy to forget that as all of this is [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1136.56s)]
*  happening. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1141.04s)]
*  And last week, the U.S. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1142.8s)]
*  announced it was sending eight billion dollars more to Ukraine, drawing down [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1144.84s)]
*  eight billion dollars more of the authorization to send weapons to Ukraine [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1148.32s)]
*  to continue to fight a feudal losing war with Russia. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1151.64s)]
*  And the very next day announced that it was sending eight and a half billion [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1154.64s)]
*  dollars to Israel to fuel all this. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1157.6s)]
*  Parts of North Carolina and other parts of the Appalachia are drowning as a [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1163.28s)]
*  result of a hurricane. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1167.4s)]
*  And the people who are the victims of that are getting very little help from [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1170.0s)]
*  the federal government. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1175.68s)]
*  And that's because, as we've seen for many years, the establishment wings of [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1178.68s)]
*  each party have high priorities, none of which include the welfare of the [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1182.76s)]
*  American people, the only real priority that they ought to have. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1187.2s)]
*  In theory, that's what they're elected to serve. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1190.6000000000001s)]
*  The right-wing journalist, Sean Davis, noticed the following about Mitch [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1195.24s)]
*  McConnell today. He said, quote, Mitch McConnell represents a large swath of [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1198.92s)]
*  Appalachia. In the last week, he has tweeted about the U.N., Israel, Iran, [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1204.0800000000002s)]
*  Syria, Lebanon, Hezbollah, and defense spending, but not a word about Hurricane [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1211.6000000000001s)]
*  Helene or North Carolina or flooding or helping the dying Appalachians, which, [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1217.3600000000001s)]
*  to me, is about as perfect of an expression of the priority scheme of the [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1224.56s)]
*  bipartisan rolling class in D.C. They love to spend huge amounts of money on [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1230.72s)]
*  foreign wars. They love to finance other countries they're obsessed with, who [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1234.56s)]
*  they're going to bomb. And as the communities that they represent continue [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1238.96s)]
*  to be destroyed, including basically drowning to death in a hurricane with [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1243.76s)]
*  very little federal intervention or federal resources being sent, they don't [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1249.04s)]
*  even pretend to care that much because, in fact, they don't. Now, [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1252.8799999999999s)]
*  while all of this is happening, as I said today, although there's been all this [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1260.28s)]
*  kind of hysteria about this attack on Israel and how terrorizing it was to [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1266.56s)]
*  Israelis and what a monstrous assault this was on Israel, even though not a [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1272.6s)]
*  hair on the head of a single Israeli, as far as we know, was harmed, the [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1279.6s)]
*  Israelis killed far more people, far more Palestinians, just today alone, [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1284.36s)]
*  than all these scary, terrible, monstrous missiles from Iran that landed in Israel [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1289.6799999999998s)]
*  killed. Here from Reuters, quote, fighting rages as Israeli bombardment [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1294.32s)]
*  kills tens in Gaza. Quote, at a refugee camp, Israel killed at least 13 people. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1299.84s)]
*  There has been no immediate comment by the Israeli army on these particular [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1307.0s)]
*  strikes. Palestinian Umm Hussein al-Durma was in Deir al-Bala where the [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1310.6000000000001s)]
*  bodies were taken. Quote, they targeted 14 sleeping people, adults and children. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1319.04s)]
*  What can I tell you? They were not doing anything. They were sleeping. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1324.8400000000001s)]
*  Palestinian medics said another strike on a school sheltering. Gazans killed [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1327.4s)]
*  multiple people. Could you even imagine Dana Bash making that sound that she [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1334.04s)]
*  made when she saw missiles falling harmlessly on Tel Aviv? Oh my God. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1340.08s)]
*  It really is the case. There's just no getting around it. That so much of how [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1347.3999999999999s)]
*  we see the Middle East, so much of our policy there, so much of how we react, [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1353.28s)]
*  is based on the same calculation that the Israelis have embraced, namely that [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1357.32s)]
*  Jewish lives, the lives of Israelis, are infinitely more valuable than the lives [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1360.96s)]
*  of Arabs in the region. There's just no denying it. That's the only thing that [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1366.72s)]
*  can explain how we can watch tens of thousands, if not more, innocent people [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1372.04s)]
*  in Gaza be obliterated over the last 12 months by Israel and then all of us turn [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1377.92s)]
*  around today and act like Israel is the besieged victim when not a single Israeli [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1383.92s)]
*  died on a day that they killed more Palestinians. All of this coincided with [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1389.32s)]
*  a new report from Oxfam International that was released yesterday and the [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1394.8s)]
*  title shows that it's a study analyzing how many innocent people were [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1404.0s)]
*  killed in Gaza by the Israeli military over the last year and here's the title, [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1409.8799999999999s)]
*  quote, more women and children have been killed in Gaza by the Israeli military [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1413.96s)]
*  than any other recent conflict in a single year. Quote, conservative figures, [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1418.08s)]
*  conservative figures show that more than 6,000 women and 11,000 children were [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1424.84s)]
*  killed in Gaza by the Israeli military over the last 12 months. Data from 2004 [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1430.36s)]
*  to 2021 on direct conflict deaths from the Small Arms Survey estimates the [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1436.0s)]
*  highest number of women killed in a single year was 2,600 in Iraq in 2016. A [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1441.8s)]
*  report by the organization Every Casualty Counts examined information on [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1449.48s)]
*  over 11,000 children killed across the first two and a half years of the Syrian [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1454.24s)]
*  conflict, or an average of over 4,700 deaths a year. UN reports on children in [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1459.1599999999999s)]
*  armed conflict over the last 18 years shows that no other conflict killed a [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1465.56s)]
*  higher number of civilians in one year. And for all the talk about how brutal [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1469.24s)]
*  and savage the Russian war in Ukraine was, there's been a higher number of [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1474.92s)]
*  children killed by the Israelis in Gaza than the total number of [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1482.0s)]
*  Ukrainian civilians killed by Russia in the entire war over the last [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1487.48s)]
*  two and a half years. And so when it comes time to hear about how the US [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1492.52s)]
*  government has to defend Israel because Israel is besieged, there were [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1499.48s)]
*  Israelis going on television today saying, what country could possibly live [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1503.2s)]
*  like this? How can you tolerate this? With absolutely no self-awareness of what [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1506.68s)]
*  they've been doing to the people surrounding them, wiping out entire [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1511.72s)]
*  families every day, killing a thousand people alone in Beirut over the last [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1515.8000000000002s)]
*  week. When you actually look at it in context, it really becomes truly [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1521.8s)]
*  remarkable just how distorted the narrative is. But again, I just want to [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1528.8s)]
*  emphasize this narrative is believed in the United States, is believed in Israel, [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1533.44s)]
*  it's believed in Western Europe, it's believed in almost nowhere else around [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1537.9199999999998s)]
*  the world. And I see a lot of conservatives who defend Israel above [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1541.08s)]
*  all else constantly saying, oh who cares what the rest of the world thinks? [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1547.2s)]
*  Well if you're somebody who believes that stopping China or limiting China's [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1550.92s)]
*  influence is this existential overarching priority, which they often [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1555.52s)]
*  say it is, saying I don't care what the rest of the world thinks is the dumbest [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1562.0s)]
*  possible thing you could possibly say, a major reason China has been strengthened [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1565.84s)]
*  as we're going to show you in a little bit, is precisely because of the [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1569.6s)]
*  perception in the world, not the quote international community meaning our [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1575.32s)]
*  Western European allies in Australia and the United States, but the actual world, [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1579.44s)]
*  the whole rest of the world, about what the US is and what it has been doing and [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJh4A_go6E&t=1584.56s)]
