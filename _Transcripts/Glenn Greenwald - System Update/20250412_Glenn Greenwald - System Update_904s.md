# Kamala's Covert Influencer Campaign EXPOSED
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [April 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g)
*  You recently wrote this article to an exclusive investigation that you published on your substack, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=0.0s)]
*  the title of which is Democrats Dark Money Fund for TikTok Influencers Social Media [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=11.76s)]
*  Craze and there people can see it on the screen. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=17.84s)]
*  I want to ask you to sort of talk about your findings, but the thing I found so funny about [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=20.84s)]
*  this article is that when Kamala Harris began running and you know like over we were so [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=24.24s)]
*  gaslit first about Biden like oh if you say Biden's not mentally fit it means you're spreading [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=31.32s)]
*  disinformation and then suddenly they were like oh my god we see he's mentally unfit [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=36.96s)]
*  after the debate and they had to get rid of him and then they put Kamala in and you know [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=39.96s)]
*  she was considered a joke for four years and then it suddenly became she's exciting the [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=43.12s)]
*  whole country she's like a generational political talent and a lot of it was done based on this [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=47.2s)]
*  social media excitement that they were pointing to. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=51.72s)]
*  I'm sure some of which was organic but a lot of which obviously was not and what is it that you [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=54.72s)]
*  found in this article that suggests at least a good portion of it wasn't? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=58.8s)]
*  Yeah so you know there's been a little bit of reporting over the years that the various [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=64.4s)]
*  campaign committees or candidates will fund you know an influencer on TikTok or Instagram and [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=68.56s)]
*  it's you know a hundred thousand dollars disclosed here and there. There's a little bit of reporting [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=74.08s)]
*  on it last year that the DNC had given small amounts to influencers. Well that was really [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=78.72s)]
*  just the tip of the iceberg. I obtained documents from a group of democratic donors you know [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=84.64s)]
*  billionaires folks like George Soros and others who had put money into this dark money effort [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=90.88s)]
*  you know was not disclosed during the election. It was through this 501c4 LLC kind of arrangement [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=98.4s)]
*  that you know doesn't have to report any of its disbursements or its contributions and it had [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=104.48s)]
*  this parallel effort to the Kamala campaign to basically create to orchestrate enthusiasm [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=110.56s)]
*  for this candidate. So you know a lot of those brat Charlie XCX memes of people dancing and doing [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=118.88000000000001s)]
*  sketches and comedy shows they even funded kind of a black voter oriented YouTube talk show [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=125.36s)]
*  there was just a number of sketches and YouTube influencers actually the entire effort reached [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=134.48s)]
*  about 500 different creators across various platforms where they were coaching creators [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=139.76s)]
*  directly financing them creating this kind of shadow effort to sell Kamala Harris to voters and [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=146.32s)]
*  you know that was a very tough sell. This was not a candidate that had organic appeal to Gen Z or [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=153.51999999999998s)]
*  to young voters. In fact if you look at the polls you had really quite the opposite but it attempted [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=158.88s)]
*  to manufacture support for this candidate and you know for a brief moment last summer it seemed [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=164.4s)]
*  to be working but at the end of the day you know the wheels really came off because if anything the [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=170.16s)]
*  targeted demographics of young people black voters Latino voters they actually departed the [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=174.88s)]
*  Democratic Party in historic numbers. I want to just ask you and maybe this is kind of like a [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=181.52s)]
*  ambiguous observation maybe it's even a little subjective but when I was reading your article [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=188.08s)]
*  and even some of the examples you gave about some of the content that was produced by secret [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=193.76s)]
*  payments it was always just so cringy it was just so embarrassing it always seems like [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=198.88s)]
*  Democrats have no capability to speak in any kind of an authentic voice like when they try and like [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=206.23999999999998s)]
*  do content for TikTok or content for the kids it always just seems so contrived and just ah just [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=212.79999999999998s)]
*  you want to kind of run in the opposite direction and you can see now and it's so obvious that these [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=221.04s)]
*  Democrats are being told oh look one of the reason people like Trump is because he speaks [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=227.44s)]
*  the way people speak at home he curses a lot and now you see a lot of them like cursing whereas [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=232.64s)]
*  they never did before just like overnight you know they're like that's bullshit when they go on cable [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=237.44s)]
*  or whatever it's so obvious they've been programmed that way and you know I'm not saying everything [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=241.2s)]
*  Republicans do along those lines is going to connect or super organic or natural but you [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=246.64s)]
*  cannot deny that one of Trump's real political talents is speaking to ordinary people in a way [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=254.16s)]
*  that they just are convinced seems like the way they think and talk about things that has all you [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=259.84s)]
*  know I remember as a matter of fact uh maybe it was the 90s when I was living in New York [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=263.91999999999996s)]
*  and I remember this I don't know why I remember this but Trump had visited a construction site [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=270.8s)]
*  and he was talking afterward about how when he goes to this construction site he spends like an [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=276.16s)]
*  hour talking to the construction workers and how they minute he gets there they start screaming [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=281.6s)]
*  his name and he was like that's real fame you know like anyone can be famous among like the elite [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=287.04s)]
*  but real fame is like when construction workers call you your name and he kind of was priding [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=292.40000000000003s)]
*  himself on that I think I remembered it because it's a little pathetic to be like I'm really famous [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=296.32s)]
*  you know is that kind of comes from insecurity but he that is you know that's why he was a [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=300.08s)]
*  successful TV star too like he has that ability to connect with ordinary people the way they speak [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=304.8s)]
*  his humor all of that and Democrats just don't like why do you think that is well you know [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=309.76s)]
*  part of it's that the Democrats retreated from presenting an authentic Kamala like I think Kamala [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=316.56s)]
*  actually does have an interesting life story you know even though she's this kind of creature of [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=323.2s)]
*  the establishment and she's someone who's biracial who grew up in the very segregated part of Berkeley [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=327.36s)]
*  and you know who went to a Hindu temple most of her life and have lots of interesting kind of [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=332.96000000000004s)]
*  relationships coming up in the San Francisco political machine but she didn't talk about any [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=338.24s)]
*  of it right like she always presented this version of herself that I think polled well or at least [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=342.40000000000003s)]
*  what seemed to kind of fit the mold of what voters are expected to support so she didn't she just [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=347.36s)]
*  talked about her experience in the church as a Christian she only kind of talked about herself [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=353.04s)]
*  as a black woman rather than someone who had a very mixed race experience she even lied about [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=357.76000000000005s)]
*  her Berkeley upbringing she kept saying she's from Oakland you know because that seems to have a [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=362.40000000000003s)]
*  little bit more authenticity than rather than triggering people and discussing her her roots [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=366.0s)]
*  actually in Berkeley and in contrast to that you had Donald Trump going on Theo Vonn's podcast and [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=370.32000000000005s)]
*  talking for an hour about his brother's suicide and being very I think very real and authentic [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=377.52s)]
*  you know I think voters especially when they're you know looking at these more long-form platforms [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=383.84s)]
*  uh looking you know on YouTube or on podcasts or even on other forms of social media they're [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=389.76s)]
*  looking to connect with politicians as real human beings and Kamala Harris could could never really [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=395.68s)]
*  present herself as a true human being so that's that's where this kind of the documents I dug up [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=401.28s)]
*  came in like they were kind of obsessed with pouring this you know 10 million dollar fund [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=406.32s)]
*  into getting people to do little dances and sketches to try to humanize her or to try to [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=410.08s)]
*  humanize humanize her appeal you can't manufacture that you just have to be real with voters and kind [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=414.64s)]
*  of show all your your scars and warts and not be ashamed of them and you know this constant attempt [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=419.28s)]
*  to refashion Kamala as this you know super progressive you know almost like civil rights [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=424.8s)]
*  black power icon plus she's a cop plus you know she's part of the Biden legacy it just felt very [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=430.88s)]
*  contrived because it was yeah I mean I always thought you know I always had the impression [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=437.52000000000004s)]
*  once Kamala Harris became vice president where she was expected to be responsible for a whole [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=442.8s)]
*  variety of issues I don't think she knew anything about because she just never had to deal with them [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=448.16s)]
*  before she wasn't an expert in them you know she spent her whole career as a prosecutor basically [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=452.64s)]
*  attorney general prosecutor and then when she got to the senate her moments where she kind of [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=458.88s)]
*  had good moments where she sort of signed were about the law you know she was like very aggressive [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=463.2s)]
*  questioning Brett Kavanaugh she you know kind of interrogated in a very kind of effective courtroom [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=468.24s)]
*  manner other Trump nominees in the in the first term but she really didn't know anything about [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=474.24s)]
*  international relations or anything else and I always got the impression that when she was [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=478.96s)]
*  speaking she was petrified of saying a wrong word that could be construed as like a mistake [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=483.52s)]
*  and she just seems so imprisoned and this is you know this is what I I I'm finding kind of [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=490.0s)]
*  confounding is you know for a long time that was the role of politics right like you it would be a [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=497.03999999999996s)]
*  scandal if you say the wrong thing if you like speak out of line if you make a mistake whatever [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=503.2s)]
*  and then Trump came along and just blew all that away you know I remember in 2015 that was when [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=508.88s)]
*  Trump spoke pejoratively about John McCain who the press worshiped and loved and considered to be a [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=514.08s)]
*  saint and he didn't just speak negatively about him he was said something kind of shocking like [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=520.72s)]
*  people just didn't say which is you know oh I yeah he was captured as a war criminal but I prefer the [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=524.56s)]
*  the good pilots and people in the military you don't get captured I prefer that I think that's [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=530.4s)]
*  more impressive and I remember all these journalists including like Dan bald sort of like the dean of [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=534.88s)]
*  the Washington press corps wrote articles saying oh this is the end of Trump there's no way you [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=540.16s)]
*  could survive something like this and he just blew right past it blew past every single you know [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=545.84s)]
*  didn't matter what he said how he said it you know what whether he was wrong whether he made [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=551.12s)]
*  errors like he was speaking so authentically that it changed the way people started expecting politics [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=555.68s)]
*  probably the internet changed that as well so that now people aren't listening to like [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=559.84s)]
*  lester holt in a suit speaking like an uber formal way they're listening to people who have more [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=564.1600000000001s)]
*  authentic voices they expect that authenticity and it's taken the democrats so long to realize [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=568.64s)]
*  they're not in that world anymore and it's almost like the whole party is programmed with these [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=574.8000000000001s)]
*  obsolete rules that they just can't get them there's like it just feels like there's no core there you [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=581.2800000000001s)]
*  know there's no like character even now like when they're cursing and like trying to be more [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=586.8s)]
*  rambunctious or whatever it just seems so consultant scripted like there's no there's no [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=591.92s)]
*  vibrancy to it i mean is do you think like this is inherent in the democratic party or is this [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=598.3199999999999s)]
*  something that they can kind of finally break out of it's hard to say i feel that part of the [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=604.56s)]
*  problem for the democrats is that for whatever reason and it's a complex problem of both issue [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=611.6800000000001s)]
*  group issue special interest group politics and the kind of pathologies of modern liberalism perhaps [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOAnx9qFG4g&t=617.6800000000001s)]
