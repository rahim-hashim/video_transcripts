# JULIAN ASSANGE IS A FREE MAN
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [June 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ)
*  Julian Assange that we wanted to tell you about. We're doing our best to analyze it as much as [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=0.0s)]
*  possible. The news just broke about a plea deal that Julian Assange has reached with the United [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=12.92s)]
*  States under which he would agree to plead guilty to one felony charge and in return prosecutors [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=18.2s)]
*  will seek a 62 month sentence which is the amount of time he already has spent in prison so it would [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=27.62s)]
*  essentially allow him to be released from prison and return to Australia with no further constraints [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=34.260000000000005s)]
*  immediately. And I'm gonna take a little bit we're gonna take a little bit of time just to analyze [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=40.18s)]
*  that but do we want to do this ad first before we do that? Alright let's cover this right now given [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=45.94s)]
*  so I'm I just got word of this I'm gonna be looking at this with you the CNN report and we have been [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=54.58s)]
*  talking about the likelihood or at least the hope and the possibility that this could happen for a [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=62.019999999999996s)]
*  lot of reasons which I'll go over in a second but I'm gonna be reading this with you from CNN. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=67.25999999999999s)]
*  Julian Assange agrees to a plea deal with the Biden administration that would allow him to avoid [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=71.02s)]
*  imprisonment in the United States. Quote, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has agreed to plead guilty [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=76.14s)]
*  to a felony charge related to his alleged role in one of the largest US government breaches of [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=83.34s)]
*  classified material as part of a deal with the Justice Department that will allow him to avoid [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=88.62s)]
*  imprisonment in the United States according to newly filed federal court documents. Under the terms [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=93.10000000000001s)]
*  of the new agreement the just the Justice Department prosecutors will seek a 62 month sentence which is [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=99.42s)]
*  equal to the amount of time Assange has served in a high security prison in London while he fought [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=105.46000000000001s)]
*  extradition to the United States. The plea deal would credit that time served allowing Assange to [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=111.46s)]
*  immediately return to Australia his native country. The plea deal still must be approved by a federal [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=117.25999999999999s)]
*  judge. Assange has faced 18 counts from a 2019 indictment for his alleged role in the breach that [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=122.44s)]
*  carried a maximum of up to 175 years in prison though he was unlikely to be sentenced to that [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=129.78s)]
*  time in full. Assange is being pursued by US authorities for publishing confidential military [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=134.22s)]
*  records supplied by former Army Intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning in 2010 and 11. US officials [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=140.1s)]
*  allege that Assange goaded Manning into obtaining thousands of pages of unfiltered US diplomatic [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=147.12s)]
*  cables that potentially endangered confidential sources. Iraq war related significant activity [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=153.1s)]
*  reports and information related to Guantanamo detainees. President Joe Biden recent months has [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=159.18s)]
*  alluded to a possible deal pushed by Australian government officials to return Assange to [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=164.66s)]
*  Australia. FBI and Justice Department officials have opposed any deal that didn't include a felony [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=169.98s)]
*  guilty plea by Assange. People briefed on that matter told CNN. Last month the US court ruled that [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=175.54s)]
*  Assange had the right to appeal his final challenge against extradition to the US dealing a win to him [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=181.54s)]
*  and his yearlong fight to avoid prosecution in the States for his for his alleged crimes. Okay so [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=188.34s)]
*  this is something that and we're doing some reporting out now as we are on air as well [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=200.22s)]
*  about exactly what the release would look like and what dates it would be but let me give you [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=209.26s)]
*  my impressions of this deal which as I've said I've talked about before the possibility of [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=213.86s)]
*  something like this happening. So let's just go through a few points. First of all on a personal [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=219.02s)]
*  level Julian Assange has now spent almost 15 years in various forms of detention. When he [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=227.22000000000003s)]
*  faced accusations of sexual assault in Sweden his position was I'm willing to go to Sweden, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=237.58s)]
*  get on the next plane to Stockholm provided that Sweden doesn't use my presence exploit my presence [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=243.66000000000003s)]
*  on Swedish soil to turn me over to the US. That was always his biggest fear was being turned over [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=252.02s)]
*  to the US and at the time British pundits and American pundits mocked him for paranoia and as [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=256.3s)]
*  it turned out it was anything but paranoia it was absolutely true the US government did want to [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=261.90000000000003s)]
*  nab him and get him to the United States so that he can put him in a US dungeon for the rest of [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=267.34s)]
*  his life and as a result he sought asylum which is a legal right recognized by every country in [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=273.09999999999997s)]
*  Ecuador and Ecuador granted it and even Ecuador said to Sweden we'll release the, we'll lift the [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=279.62s)]
*  asylum if you agree that if he comes to Sweden to answer or to be interrogated about these sexual [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=286.78s)]
*  assault allegations filed by two women and their allegation was that they had consensual sex with [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=294.3s)]
*  Julian Assange but that during the sex he didn't wear a condom and they had not consented to you [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=301.3s)]
*  know note to him not wearing a condom and that was a form of rape or sexual assault under Swedish [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=307.1s)]
*  law. His argument was that the position of Ecuador was well lift our asylum and he'll go to Sweden the [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=312.06s)]
*  next day and the Swedish government said no even though they had the full power we will not give [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=319.46000000000004s)]
*  you that guarantee and as a result Ecuador gave him asylum and he stayed inside the Ecuadorian [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=324.22s)]
*  Embassy in London from 2010 to 2018 and I know that may sound like some grand place but I visited [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=330.06s)]
*  Julian there and it was basically a tiny little two-bedroom apartment and a high-rise building in [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=338.62s)]
*  the middle of London that had no outdoor space had no place to go and absorb Sun it had windows [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=344.26000000000005s)]
*  but that was about it he was spied on he was detained in this tiny little space that he could [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=353.66s)]
*  not leave the British had 24-hour police surrounding the building so that if he took one step out of [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=359.18s)]
*  that embassy he would be immediately arrested so he was detained from 2010 to 2018 without having [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=365.62s)]
*  been convicted of any crime and then the Trump administration under Mike Pompeo succeeded in [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=372.18s)]
*  coercing Ecuador through a combination of threats and bribes promises of benefits to lift that [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=379.34000000000003s)]
*  asylum which Ecuador then did in 2018 and that allowed the British police to go in and arrest [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=387.26000000000005s)]
*  Assange and they put him in a high-security prison in London Belmarsh prison which has [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=393.18s)]
*  terrorist suspects and the worst criminals there is the BBC calls Belmarsh the British Guantanamo [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=400.22s)]
*  and that's where he has been for the last six years almost now so you have eight years of [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=407.5s)]
*  detention effective imprisonment inside the Ecuadorian Embassy another sick five plus years [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=415.74s)]
*  in a high-security maximum security prison inside the UK and the only crime of which Julian Assange [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=422.54s)]
*  was ever convicted during those 14 years of captivity was a charge of bail jumping a misdemeanor [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=433.78s)]
*  charge that he was convicted once the British police arrested him and the charge was when you [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=443.82s)]
*  didn't show up for your court date back in 2010 and instead sought asylum with Ecuador you were [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=451.58s)]
*  guilty of bail jumping and therefore we're gonna convict you of that and his prison sentence was [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=456.94s)]
*  51 months which was the maximum under British law it's a misdemeanor so it couldn't be here he [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=463.02s)]
*  obviously served that sentence long ago he served it as of 2019 and then right when he was about [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=469.02s)]
*  to get out that was when the Trump administration under the Trump Justice Department indicted Assange [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=476.7s)]
*  and then argued to a British court that he had to remain in prison while the extradition process [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=485.34s)]
*  unfolded because Assange had already proved that he was a flight risk if you let him out on bail [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=493.58s)]
*  and the British court agreed and said you have to remain in prison until this extradition process [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=499.78s)]
*  is resolved and the extradition process has now taken six years it's not really all that close to [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=505.97999999999996s)]
*  the end and there have been Assange's doctors and psychiatrists who have warned that both his [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=512.66s)]
*  mental and physical health were in extreme danger through this 15 year detention and on a personal [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=520.58s)]
*  level and of course disappointed that he pled guilty to a felony count because I believe he [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=531.7s)]
*  vehemently that he's guilty of nothing and that if anything he was owed a lot of compensation for [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=538.44s)]
*  unjust imprisonment that was why they want a 62 month sentence so that he can't claim that even [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=544.16s)]
*  one day in prison was unjust but on a personal level he's married he has two children who are [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=549.4s)]
*  now growing I think they're seven and eight and the ordeal that he has been subjected to over the [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=556.4s)]
*  last 15 years is almost impossible to express so whatever Julian felt like he should do and his [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=563.32s)]
*  family felt like they should do to get him out of prison and finally end this nightmare and make [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=570.9200000000001s)]
*  him be free I totally support that I have a few points to make about the Assange thing the reason [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=575.0s)]
*  why I've been saying that this doesn't surprise me is because I never believe that the Biden [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=589.2s)]
*  administration actually wanted to bring Julian Assange onto American soil to stand trial imagine [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=595.44s)]
*  the spectacle that that would have created as Biden heads into an election imagine the risks [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=601.1600000000001s)]
*  in the US government of allowing Julian Assange to go on the stand and speak about the things that [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=609.1600000000001s)]
*  he believes he has discovered and wants to say and it would put on Joe Biden's record that he [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=613.16s)]
*  would be the first American president in history to preside over the imprisonment not of a source [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=620.9599999999999s)]
*  who leaked information but of someone who published classified information which every [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=625.24s)]
*  newspaper in the United States does on a regular basis the idea goal of putting Julian Assange [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=631.52s)]
*  in prison was to crush Julian Assange physically and mentally and they've succeeded in doing that [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=639.2s)]
*  and they no longer care they didn't they never cared if he came and stood trial in the United [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=644.32s)]
*  States they wanted to break Assange and simultaneously send a message to any other future Assanges that we [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=648.84s)]
*  will ruin your life if you publish our secrets the same reason why they won't let Edward Snowden come [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=656.32s)]
*  back to the United States why they want to put him in prison for the rest of his life as well it is [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=663.12s)]
*  a deterrent message to keep their ability to hide their own crimes through secrecy immune from the [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=666.84s)]
*  one vulnerability that they have which is that brave people inside the government leak that [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=674.72s)]
*  information to the public or through the media and reveal what it is that they're doing and then [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=678.32s)]
*  finally there was a lot of pressure in Australia which remember is the only country that he has [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=684.84s)]
*  ever been a citizen of he is not a citizen of the United States he barely has stepped foot inside [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=690.32s)]
*  the United States in his life he was here for three days and the Australian citizenry started [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=695.8399999999999s)]
*  to get very angry at the subservience of the Australian government saying how is it possible [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=700.9599999999999s)]
*  that you are not standing up to United States and demanding the release of our citizen and coming [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=705.9599999999999s)]
*  back to Australia and so the Australian government pressured by that citizen growing citizen anger [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=713.24s)]
*  has been insisting that the Biden administration agree to Assange's release and that would let him [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=717.92s)]
*  go back to Australia and so I've been hoping for and even speculating about the revival of a deal [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=724.92s)]
*  of this kind there's a we have an update on it as well let me just see what this is it's a wiki [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=732.52s)]
*  it's actually a detail from the WikiLeaks account about exactly when Assange's release date would [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcJ3M86eAvQ&t=746.3199999999999s)]
