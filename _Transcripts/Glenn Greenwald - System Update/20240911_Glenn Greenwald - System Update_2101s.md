# Former Trump Official Fred Fleitz on Whether U.S. Funding of Israel Puts "America First" and More
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [September 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y)
*  Our guest this evening is Fred Flights. He was previously the Deputy Assistant to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=0.0s)]
*  President Donald Trump and the Chief of Staff to National Security Advisor John [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=11.28s)]
*  Bolton. He also worked in the State Department under the Bush-Cheney [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=15.4s)]
*  administration and he is now the Vice President of the America First Policy [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=18.92s)]
*  Institute where he is an architect of and helps to define a lot of the [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=22.56s)]
*  especially foreign policy that Donald Trump and if he wins his administration [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=28.08s)]
*  intend to pursue. Mr. Flights, thank you so much for coming on our show. It's [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=32.199999999999996s)]
*  great to see you. So I want to be, yeah absolutely, so I wanted to just give you [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=35.68s)]
*  the opportunity. I know when we promoted the show we had, we had, I think I referred [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=40.2s)]
*  to you as, or we referred to you as John Bolton's protege and you objected that. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=45.44s)]
*  You said you have a lot of differences with John Bolton so at your request we [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=49.84s)]
*  changed that to make it clear that that was in the past. So if you could, I [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=53.0s)]
*  actually had intended on asking this anyway because my perception of you had [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=57.480000000000004s)]
*  always been that you were kind of an ally or a ideological fellow traveler [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=61.8s)]
*  of John Bolton's. That's how I think you ended up in the Trump administration was [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=65.8s)]
*  when he became hired by Trump. You became his Chief of Staff and there are [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=71.28s)]
*  obviously a lot of differences now between John Bolton and President Trump [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=75.64s)]
*  in my understanding is there's a lot of differences between John Bolton and [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=78.48s)]
*  yourself. So can you talk about why it is that you think John Bolton has become [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=81.52000000000001s)]
*  such a harsh critic of Donald Trump and what differences you have with him that [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=87.04s)]
*  you didn't previously have with him in the past? Well it's a pleasure to be here. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=91.28s)]
*  I was in government for about 25 years. Most of that time I was in the [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=96.0s)]
*  intelligence community and when I worked for Bolton at State I was detailed from [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=100.14s)]
*  the CIA to the State Department and I broke with John a long time ago over [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=104.48s)]
*  bombing Iran and bombing North Korea. I was on a Tucker Carlton show in mid 2019 [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=109.44s)]
*  just when the US was about to bomb Iran and you may remember this because all of [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=115.64s)]
*  Trump's advisors wanted Trump to bomb Iran at the last minute. I should say all [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=121.2s)]
*  of them except for my colleague General Keith Kellogg. At the last minute Trump [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=125.92s)]
*  said I'm not gonna do that because I'm gonna kill 100 to 200 Iranians for just [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=130.32s)]
*  shooting down an unmanned drone. Well Tucker had me on the show because he [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=134.88s)]
*  wanted to bash me thinking when you work for Bolton you must support [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=138.48s)]
*  starting these unnecessary wars and and using military force without good reason. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=142.04s)]
*  But that is not the way I think and we had a great discussion but I think [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=146.92s)]
*  Carlson was was surprised and I also I haven't talked to John since 2020 when I [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=150.83999999999997s)]
*  denounced his book which betrayed his confidential discussions with President [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=156.48s)]
*  Trump and the Oval Office which I think did a lot of damage to the Office of the [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=162.44s)]
*  Presidency, the Office of the National Security Advisor. National Security Advisors have to [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=166.28s)]
*  basically maintain the trust of presidents and not betray information [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=171.08s)]
*  that they discuss with them confidentially. I don't know why John Bolton [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=176.16s)]
*  went off the rails with President Trump but I guess looking over it I don't [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=180.44s)]
*  think he was ever suited to work in the Trump administration. His approach of [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=184.64s)]
*  wanting to bomb Iran and bomb other countries to get things done was [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=189.24s)]
*  inconsistent with Trump's America first approach to national security. Keep us [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=193.68s)]
*  out of unnecessary wars, to use military force prudently and to use other tools [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=198.36s)]
*  of diplomacy other than military force to resolve our differences. I think [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=203.8s)]
*  that's one of the things that a lot of people who found Trump's 2016 campaign [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=208.92000000000002s)]
*  messaging appealing and not just his campaign messaging but just off the cuff [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=214.24s)]
*  when he would speak and you kind of get a sense of his instincts on things like [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=218.52s)]
*  foreign policy. One of the things that ended up being quite confusing is that [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=222.24s)]
*  there he did end up appointing a lot of people whose entire career was not just [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=225.60000000000002s)]
*  divergent from but quite antithetical to that kind of restraint, that kind of [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=230.48000000000002s)]
*  aversion to unnecessary wars, a kind of focus on domestic politics. For me Mike [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=235.8s)]
*  Pompeo is one example who ended up running the CIA and the State Department. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=240.52s)]
*  Nikki Haley who became ambassador of the UN as we saw in this campaign is another [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=243.72s)]
*  who has a lot of sharp differences with Trump and there were many others as well. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=247.0s)]
*  I recently heard someone saying that, oh it was actually RFK, that he himself [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=252.23999999999998s)]
*  posed that question to Trump. Why were there so many people in important [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=259.2s)]
*  positions in your administration who didn't share, obviously John Bolton [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=262.15999999999997s)]
*  another, who didn't share your the foreign policy vision that you outlaid [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=264.88s)]
*  and he said that Trump told him he didn't really know how to fight the [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=268.84s)]
*  permanent power faction in Washington. He got to DC, didn't know it well, a lot of [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=273.8s)]
*  people were pressuring him saying you have to hire these people, these people. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=278.8s)]
*  What is your explanation for why there ended up being so many people at such [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=281.4s)]
*  high levels of the Trump administration who clearly had never supported the [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=284.52s)]
*  foreign policy vision, the American First Vision as out as defended by [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=289.32s)]
*  Trump in 2016? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=293.2s)]
*  What you said is exactly right and I think Trump brought people in who were [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=295.6s)]
*  determined not to carry out his policies and to maybe carry out other policies [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=299.48s)]
*  without telling him or to talk him into other policies. Look, Donald Trump was the [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=303.8s)]
*  ultimate outsider. He had not worked in Washington. I don't think he even lived [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=308.12s)]
*  in Washington before he won the election and when he came into the White House [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=312.04s)]
*  there were a lot of people who seemed to have good intentions with great [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=316.84000000000003s)]
*  credentials like Condoleezza Rice and Bob Gates who referred people who'd look [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=320.12s)]
*  good on paper but Trump didn't realize, didn't have the background, his team [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=325.24s)]
*  didn't realize that these folks were not in line with his beliefs and if you talk [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=330.56s)]
*  to Trump now he'll tell you he made mistakes because he was the ultimate [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=335.8s)]
*  outsider. He was adapting and also I think Trump really underestimated the [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=338.56s)]
*  determination of the deep state to destroy him and to go after his policies. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=343.88s)]
*  Trump tried to fix this at the end of his administration but it was too late [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=348.84s)]
*  but look, Glenn, I'm happy to say now Trump and his team learned from those [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=352.64s)]
*  mistakes and I know many good people who you would agree with who were lining up [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=356.64s)]
*  to work in national security positions with Mr. Trump. He will not make that [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=361.72s)]
*  mistake again. So I want to probe on that and press a little bit on that because [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=366.88000000000005s)]
*  for me it's such an important point because part of what I found appealing [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=371.24s)]
*  about Donald Trump's 2060 campaign was this very radical deviation from what [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=376.96000000000004s)]
*  had been I think long-standing bipartisan consensus on foreign policy [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=381.76000000000005s)]
*  and maybe in the past people might have thought it was right and now it's not [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=384.72s)]
*  but whatever that was a radical break and it ended up not often being [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=388.36s)]
*  reflected in administration policy and I think in part because of that but I in [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=392.24s)]
*  addition to what you said which I totally believe that Trump got there and [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=395.76s)]
*  was kind of in the dark about you know you have a bunch of positions you have to [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=399.0s)]
*  appoint, you rely on people who are not in accordance with your ideology and you [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=402.2s)]
*  end up appointing a lot of people who who are more sabotaging or undermining [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=406.96000000000004s)]
*  what you say you want to do and what you want to do then then not. There is this [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=410.44s)]
*  other aspect to it which I think even the most ardent Trump supporters will [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=413.6s)]
*  agree is a problem which is that Trump has this personality flaw that if you [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=417.84s)]
*  flatter him if you he preys on him he's somebody who will trust and like you and [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=422.35999999999996s)]
*  even appoint you to certain positions and I just heard Trump you know I think [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=425.91999999999996s)]
*  it was when he was talking to Elon Musk maybe in a campaign rally saying look [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=430.0s)]
*  I'm somebody who's very simple if you say good things about me I will like you. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=434.0s)]
*  Do you agree that part of the reason why Trump was able to be kind of maneuvered [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=438.35999999999996s)]
*  around so easily wasn't just because of his lack of familiarity with everybody [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=443.68s)]
*  in Washington and how it worked but also this this personality trait that he has [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=448.72s)]
*  and and and what gives you confidence that that won't he won't fall prey to [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=453.24s)]
*  that again? My experience is he really was taken off guard by people like H.I. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=457.16s)]
*  McMaster and Rex Tillerson and John Bolton and and General Mattis who just [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=464.52s)]
*  weren't carrying out his policies he ordered something to be done and they [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=469.68s)]
*  decided to do something else and they all ended up being let go I just think [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=472.88s)]
*  he assumed that since he was the president people carry out his policies [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=477.76s)]
*  and let me let me add something that's related to what you're saying remember [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=481.84s)]
*  when Trump decided to talk to Kim Jong-un the establishment hated this [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=485.92s)]
*  idea John Bolton hated this idea because it's not the way you're supposed to do [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=490.04s)]
*  things presidents can't meet with blood bloodthirsty dictators like that it's [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=494.46s)]
*  the wrong thing to do but it was the right thing to do was certain a lot [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=498.2s)]
*  better than bombing North Korea and significantly lower tensions it was [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=501.84s)]
*  unconventional and in the end when it did lower tensions when it got North [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=505.59999999999997s)]
*  Korea to stop testing missiles even some of the president's liberal critics [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=509.79999999999995s)]
*  agreed that this is better than what we've tried before we should do more of [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=515.12s)]
*  this. Yeah you might remember in the 2008 presidential primary this protracted war [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=519.6s)]
*  between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton that culminated in Obama's success one [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=524.36s)]
*  of their first big differences in the debate was Obama was asked there's a [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=529.08s)]
*  series of five or six dictators I think Assad at the time Chavez other maybe Kim [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=533.32s)]
*  Jong-un or his father at the time was was running North Korea and they asked [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=539.0400000000001s)]
*  him would you agree to meet with these leaders without conditions and Obama [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=543.2800000000001s)]
*  said yes of course I think it's crucial that we have open dialogue that's the [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=547.32s)]
*  way we prevent war misperception miscommunication and Hillary Clinton [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=551.9200000000001s)]
*  said that's incredibly naive of course you don't meet with these bad leaders [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=554.9200000000001s)]
*  and so I remember very well that when Obama said it he was something that [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=557.88s)]
*  gained a lot of applause for him on the left and then when Trump started doing [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=562.08s)]
*  it there tended to be a little bit of a different reaction let me ask you about [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=565.08s)]
*  this this issue you referred to about the deep state opposing Trump being so [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=568.88s)]
*  dedicated to his sabotage you know I remember very well I still think it's [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=575.04s)]
*  one of the most important things that has happened publicly in our politics [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=579.76s)]
*  was in between Trump's election in 2016 and his inauguration on January 20th [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=582.76s)]
*  17 in 2017 there was this kind of back and forth between Trump and the CIA [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=588.56s)]
*  where he was kind of mocking them over getting a rock wrong and the [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=592.92s)]
*  intelligence wrong and I think the reason was because the CIA was piping [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=596.3199999999999s)]
*  this Russiagate narrative that Trump believed was designed to undermine the [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=600.52s)]
*  legitimacy of his election and Chuck Schumer went on Rachel Maddow and she [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=604.36s)]
*  asked him about that and Chuck Schumer said look you know even just from the perspective of being a [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=608.84s)]
*  hard-nosed businessman which Trump is it's incredibly stupid to confront and [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=613.6800000000001s)]
*  bash the CIA because everyone in Washington knows you don't do that [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=620.6800000000001s)]
*  because they have six different ways from Sunday to get back at you and for [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=623.84s)]
*  me that was just an extra I mean of course everyone knows that but that was [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=627.96s)]
*  an extraordinary thing to admit that a president the elected president cannot [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=630.76s)]
*  confront the intelligence community because they will destroy him in one way [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=634.64s)]
*  or the other now it is surprising for me to hear that from you given that you [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=637.92s)]
*  spend a lot of time as as an analyst with the CIA although I know there are [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=642.68s)]
*  people inside the intelligence community who know even better than most people [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=647.64s)]
*  what its function is what its laws are but why do you think that this permanent [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=651.16s)]
*  US security state was so devoted to sabotaging Trump either in the campaign [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=657.8s)]
*  or the administration and what kind of tools do you think they use to do that [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=663.44s)]
*  well first of all they're part of what I call the farm policy establishment and [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=667.72s)]
*  in the government they're promoting a liberal international approach to [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=673.28s)]
*  government and when I worked at the State Department career issues to say [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=677.5600000000001s)]
*  that you know we are that we are basically safeguarding the organization [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=680.96s)]
*  for the future we have to outlast these people but in the CIA and other [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=686.52s)]
*  intelligence agencies they've forgotten that their only mission is to provide [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=690.76s)]
*  intelligence support to the president they're not supposed to be second [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=695.48s)]
*  guessing the president they're not supposed to be giving speeches [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=698.84s)]
*  questioning presidential policy they're not supposed to be attending open [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=701.3199999999999s)]
*  congressional hearings where they say for congressional presidential policy are [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=705.34s)]
*  going to fail they've forgotten their mission they think they're in charge they [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=709.52s)]
*  think they have the power and the duty to adjudicate and to evaluate policy [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=714.4399999999999s)]
*  that's not do they have that power I realize you think they shouldn't but but [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=720.86s)]
*  are they really in charge do they have that power to sort of override even what [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=724.3s)]
*  an elected president might want to do well they've certainly had some success [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=729.8199999999999s)]
*  in undermining presidents and the challenge for a new Trump administration [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=734.6999999999999s)]
*  if he wins I think he's going to win it's not just to put a very good head of [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=739.3s)]
*  CIA and D&I and other agencies but there has to be reform of these agencies there [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=744.42s)]
*  has to be people brought in from the outside to basically assume positions [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=749.34s)]
*  throughout these bureaucracies not to politicize them but to make sure the [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=754.22s)]
*  careers understand that they have to keep politics out of the work and they [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=758.34s)]

*  New York Times or the foreign policy establishment now use the phrase America [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=765.62s)]
*  first several times obviously that's an important phrase for the Trump movement [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=770.38s)]
*  for Trump's worldview it definitely I know for sure means a lot of different [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=773.6600000000001s)]
*  things to a lot of different people I've interviewed plenty of people who say [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=778.28s)]
*  they are supporters of the America first worldview and yet have very different [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=780.48s)]

*  comes to let's say specifically the issue of involving United States military [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=798.04s)]
*  United States Treasury in foreign wars what does the America first vision [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=802.48s)]
*  orient or direct someone to do with regard to that question first of all [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=809.04s)]
*  you'll forgive me if I plug my book an America first approach to US national [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=815.8399999999999s)]

*  political scene the priority right now as Trump has said is to stop the killing [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1097.32s)]
*  and let's use negotiations to find a peaceful solution what would you be [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1101.9199999999998s)]
*  prepared to offer Putin to say let's freeze the conflict in a ceasefire [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1107.52s)]
*  given what he perceives as the success of the Russian military and expanding [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1112.32s)]
*  further westward into Ukraine and taking over more territory wouldn't you have to [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1116.56s)]
*  make some very meaningful concession to him for him to say okay I'm going to [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1120.48s)]
*  agree to a ceasefire and we'll put the terms of the peace deal you know years [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1124.6s)]
*  down the line why would he do that [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1129.16s)]
*  these that could be offered is to take NATO membership off the table maybe for [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1132.92s)]
*  10 to 25 years maybe some offer to to loosen some sanctions on Russia but I [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1138.2s)]
*  think also Russia should be paying for reconstruction of Ukraine so that would [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1145.24s)]
*  have to be negotiated also but I think if we're looking at what's our policy [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1149.48s)]
*  going to be with Russia down the road ultimately we have to bring Russia back [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1154.24s)]
*  into Europe as a European state Russia's not an Asian state and this alliance [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1159.08s)]
*  with Russia and China has has very dangerous implications down the road and [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1164.12s)]
*  I think that should be communicated for Russia that is the ultimate end state of [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1168.8s)]
*  this process and I think it would be in Russia's interests if though you're [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1173.24s)]
*  perceiving a little bit incorrectly what the Russians are prepared to do without [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1179.72s)]
*  a lot more concessions than the ones you suggest you're willing to make would [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1183.72s)]
*  in other words that you can't foster a ceasefire deal from because the Russians [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1189.06s)]
*  won't accept it under those terms that the West and the United States are [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1194.34s)]
*  prepared to offer would in your view President Trump be willing in that event [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1196.94s)]
*  to continue to provide the financing and arms that Ukraine needs to continue to [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1203.1799999999998s)]
*  wage the war against Russia I have to say that everything I'm saying now I'm [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1207.82s)]
*  not speaking on behalf of President Trump he speaks for himself so I have [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1212.58s)]
*  to be careful because he's worked in this very very carefully I think that [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1216.38s)]
*  maybe that would probably be part of the equation that you know we'll continue to [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1220.7800000000002s)]
*  arm Ukraine and make sure that they are secure against this Russian offensive [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1226.0200000000002s)]
*  unless it ends but but I think if you look back the chapter we wrote on the [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1230.5s)]
*  on the Ukraine conflict dinner in our book doesn't look at how to end the war [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1235.8200000000002s)]
*  it looks at how incompetent diplomacy and failing to recognize Putin's red [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1241.02s)]
*  lines led him to invade I don't agree with Putin's twisted sense of history [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1246.74s)]
*  with the Russian the Ukrainian people but he believes these things and the Biden [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1253.58s)]
*  administration simply ignored that they ignored him when he said that NATO [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1258.18s)]
*  membership was a red line and frankly if we had a halfway competent president [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1261.46s)]
*  instead of Biden Putin wouldn't have invaded yeah it was so ironic that Trump [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1265.98s)]
*  for four years was called a Russian agent and yet Russia didn't take any [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1271.14s)]
*  Ukrainian land under Trump yet seized Crimea under Obama and then seized [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1274.7s)]
*  another 20% of the country under I'd rather seize Crimea under Obama and then [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1279.3s)]
*  seize another 20% of the country under under Biden just on the final question [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1284.02s)]
*  on Ukraine though faded neighboring countries during three the last four [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1288.38s)]
*  presidents when Bush was weak when Obama was weak when Biden is weak okay [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1293.34s)]
*  but this is my question though that how is it possible to characterize Biden and [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1298.22s)]
*  the Democrats as being weak when increasingly you know we've crossed [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1304.4199999999998s)]
*  every line that we said we wouldn't cross we started just funding it then we [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1310.1399999999999s)]
*  started to provide weapons systems we said we wouldn't provide tanks aircraft [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1313.9399999999998s)]
*  carriers we're now talking about lifting all the remaining restrictions on the [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1317.62s)]
*  use of American weapons by Ukraine inside Russian territory hasn't the [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1321.18s)]
*  strategy of the Biden-Harris administration with regard to Ukraine [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1325.5800000000002s)]
*  and Russia been one of aggression not weakness it's been a a record of I [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1328.66s)]
*  think it's been a record of weakness of incompetence all the weapons that the [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1336.74s)]
*  Ukrainians needed that could have possibly moved the Russians back arrived [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1340.98s)]
*  too late or had strings attached the Russians have dug in right now there's [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1345.5s)]
*  no amount of weapons we're going to provide the Ukrainians are gonna get [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1349.58s)]
*  they're gonna push Russia out of Ukraine there is a way to get Russia out of [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1353.1s)]
*  Ukraine we can send in American troops I don't want to do that the Biden [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1357.3799999999999s)]
*  administration what doesn't want to do that that's why I'm saying this isn't a [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1361.22s)]
*  real policy it's virtue signaling Biden wants to make a boogie man out of Putin [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1364.6599999999999s)]
*  say he's like Hamas he's a war criminal so I'm gonna throw weapons over there [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1369.74s)]
*  even though the weapons are making no difference so and I want to I'm going to [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1373.62s)]
*  be respectful of your time and there's a couple other areas I absolutely want to [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1379.62s)]
*  get to with you and enjoy talking to you about this so let me just make this the [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1382.02s)]
*  last question on Ukraine this is what I guess has created some confusion is on [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1387.06s)]
*  some level your critique of the Biden administration is that their weakness [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1391.5s)]
*  was that they didn't provide more sophisticated weaponry or they impose [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1396.34s)]
*  too many limits on on Ukraine at the start of the war we should have been [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1401.18s)]
*  funding Ukraine even more arming them even more to fight the Russians even [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1404.42s)]
*  more effectively and I still hear you saying that although you believe a peace [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1407.9s)]
*  or ceasefire deal can be facilitated that in the event that it can't be you [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1412.14s)]
*  think President Trump should or at least would or at least should in your view [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1417.66s)]
*  continue to arm and fund Ukraine in what conceivable way is arming and funding [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1422.26s)]
*  Ukraine over a regional border dispute or a territorial dispute between these [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1428.14s)]
*  two countries consistent with an America first view that says we ought to be [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1432.94s)]
*  spending our resources not to help foreign countries but to help our own [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1436.8600000000001s)]
*  country to secure own country to improve the lives of our own citizens [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1440.38s)]
*  well let's start with why I think that the Biden administration should have sent [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1445.1000000000001s)]
*  more weapons at the beginning of the war I didn't support sending a lot of [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1449.6200000000001s)]
*  weapons to Ukraine for the war but once the war began there was a short period [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1453.98s)]
*  of time when the Ukrainians had a tremendous advantage and could have [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1459.06s)]
*  pushed the Russians out or back substantially but the Biden administration [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1462.9s)]
*  didn't do that it gave them the minimum amount of weapons with strings attached [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1466.46s)]
*  which allowed the Russians to recover and to dig in and now they're not going [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1470.18s)]
*  anywhere I don't want to reward Russian aggression I don't want Russia to take [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1474.3s)]
*  over Ukraine at the same time I don't want us to be depleting our arm stockpiles [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1478.98s)]
*  and funding an endless war so you're right it is a bit of a contradiction we [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1484.38s)]
*  have to find a way to strike the right balance between not hurting our [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1488.8600000000001s)]
*  country and our ability to defend ourselves and our allies and basically [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1494.46s)]
*  rewarding Russian aggression to Ukraine. Whenever I've had members of Congress on [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1498.78s)]
*  who identify as America first or Trump surrogates or spokespeople one of the [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1503.98s)]
*  main ways that they justify their opposition to the funding of the war in [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1509.6200000000001s)]
*  Ukraine on America first grounds as they say look our cities are falling apart [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1512.54s)]
*  our populations are you know deprived of all sorts of basic services Marjorie [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1517.3s)]
*  Taylor Greene gave a speech that was actually very true about how mothers in [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1521.9s)]

*  sending hundreds of billions of dollars over to Ukraine to fund their war and [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1528.74s)]
*  she was saying why is our priority you know and you hear Tucker Carlson saying that [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1533.1s)]
*  that's kind of the America first worldview that a lot of its adherents [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1536.46s)]
*  have that we should not we should only help other countries once we've taken [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1539.6599999999999s)]

*  war though that we're funding is the Israeli war in Gaza we're not only [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1553.3s)]

*  the US government uses to send over to Israel when millions of Israeli citizens [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7k30B0Tn4Y&t=1582.3s)]
