# Media Melts Down Over Tulsi Gabbard's Nomination
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [November 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk)
*  Here, just as the last appointment that I want to cover from Donald Trump, this is also [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=0.0s)]
*  today. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=12.96s)]
*  I am pleased to announce that former Congresswoman Lieutenant Colonel Tulsi Gabbard will serve [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=13.96s)]
*  as Director of National Intelligence for over two decades. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=18.26s)]
*  Tulsi has fought for all our country and the freedoms of all Americans. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=22.56s)]
*  She is a former candidate for the Democratic president's nomination. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=25.56s)]
*  She has broad support in both parties. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=29.08s)]
*  She is now a proud Republican. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=30.919999999999998s)]
*  Now Tulsi is often misunderstood because she's often railed against the evils of regime [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=32.32s)]
*  change wars. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=40.4s)]
*  She doesn't want to go to places like Iraq or Syria or Libya and change the government [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=41.4s)]
*  and replace it with a new one. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=45.92s)]
*  She doesn't think that's the role of the United States. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=48.96s)]
*  The same reason she doesn't think we should be doing that in Ukraine, but instead facilitating [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=50.56s)]
*  a peace. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=53.68s)]
*  But that doesn't mean she's anti-war. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=54.68s)]
*  She very much believes that the United States should be extremely aggressive in fighting [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=57.4s)]
*  against what she considers to be Muslim extremist organizations. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=61.76s)]
*  But in terms of this position, her role would be to root out the subversive elements in [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=65.48s)]
*  the intelligence community and prevent it from interfering in our domestic politics. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=72.0s)]
*  And there I think she could actually do a very good job. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=76.52s)]
*  Now the choice of Tulsi Gabbard was also something that produced enormous outrage on the part [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=79.4s)]
*  of the Washington establishment. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=88.32000000000001s)]
*  Not quite as much as Matt Gaetz, but almost as much. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=89.48s)]
*  And it's all based on this hysterical McCarthyite lie that they use against anyone who they [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=92.2s)]
*  disagree with in foreign policy that she's a Russian agent. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=97.44s)]
*  Here is David Frum's reaction today. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=100.7s)]
*  Quote, why not cut out the middle woman and just name Putin as director of national intelligence? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=103.2s)]
*  And that was all begun when Hillary Clinton in this statement in 2019 tried to insinuate [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=108.68s)]
*  that Tulsi Gabbard's real plan when running for president was that she was being groomed [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=116.64s)]
*  by the Russians to pull out of the race when she was running as a Democrat, run as a third [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=123.24000000000001s)]
*  party candidate, to split the Democratic vote between Biden and Gabbard and help Donald [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=128.28s)]
*  Trump win as the Kremlin wanted. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=133.64000000000001s)]
*  Obviously Hillary Clinton was lying. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=135.60000000000002s)]
*  None of what she said was happening actually ended up happening. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=137.79999999999998s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard did drop out of the race, but she didn't run as a third party. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=141.23999999999998s)]
*  She ran as she dropped out and endorsed Joe Biden. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=145.32s)]
*  She was still in the Democratic Party. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=149.55999999999997s)]
*  She had just been three years earlier, the vice chair of the DNC, something that she [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=151.11999999999998s)]
*  resigned because she supported Bernie Sanders in protest of their cheating to make sure [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=157.83999999999997s)]
*  Hillary Clinton won. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=161.67999999999998s)]
*  But here's what Hillary Clinton said about Tulsi Gabbard. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=162.67999999999998s)]
*  This is the sort of thing that is now being used to try and stop her nomination. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=164.88s)]
*  The bizarre Hillary Clinton attack, Betsy, on Tulsi Gabbard. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=169.79999999999998s)]
*  First, I want folks to hear it. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=174.64s)]
*  I think they've got their eye on somebody who's currently in the Democratic primary [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=177.6s)]
*  and are grooming her to be the third party candidate. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=181.84s)]
*  She's a favorite of the Russians and that's assuming Jill Stein will give it up, which [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=184.84s)]
*  she might not because she's also a Russian asset. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=190.01999999999998s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard responded, Betsy, you, the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, personification [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=195.36s)]
*  of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long, it's now clear that this [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=200.08s)]
*  primary is between you and me. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=203.16000000000003s)]
*  Don't cowardly hide behind your proxies during the race. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=204.8s)]
*  Now think about this for just a second. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=208.0s)]
*  People like David Frum, who in 2002 were writing the lies that George Bush was going to read [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=211.68s)]
*  to convince the country to invade Iraq. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=218.08s)]
*  He was at the time a speechwriter for George Bush. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=221.64s)]
*  Knowing that he, David Frum, would never get near the war, he was so desperate for whatever [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=225.51999999999998s)]
*  motives, he wanted the United States to start by removing the government of Iraq and replacing [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=229.68s)]
*  it with a more pro-US, pro-Israel government. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=236.56s)]
*  He knew he was going to never get anywhere near that war. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=241.14s)]
*  Hillary Clinton voted for that war, advocated for that war in Iraq as well. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=243.95999999999998s)]
*  Obviously the Clinton family has never gotten anywhere near the wars they support. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=247.92s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard volunteered for the military. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=252.32s)]
*  She went and fought in that Iraq war that Hillary Clinton and David Frum were cheerleading [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=254.84s)]
*  from a safe distance. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=258.8s)]
*  She remained in the military to this very day in the reserves. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=261.03999999999996s)]
*  She's a lieutenant colonel. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=263.76s)]
*  Imagine going to war in a war that people like Hillary Clinton and David Frum send you [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=266.36s)]
*  to knowing that you have, they have no intention to go and get near the violence. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=270.88s)]
*  And then when you come back, those people impugn your loyalty and your patriotism by [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=277.15999999999997s)]
*  accusing you of being a Russian agent or a Russian asset. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=283.52s)]
*  Just imagine the audacity that takes, and yet that is becoming one of the main goals [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=290.12s)]
*  to stop Tulsi Gabbard. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=295.96s)]
*  I think Tulsi Gabbard and Matt Gaetz and possibly Pete Hegseth are going to be among the people [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=297.2s)]
*  of the current nominees encountering the most difficulty in getting confirmation even from [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=304.76000000000005s)]
*  the Republican Senate. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=311.48s)]
*  And that assumes, that doesn't assume other nominees that are likely to come, including [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=314.32000000000005s)]
*  RFK Jr., who is likely to lead some health agency, maybe the FDA or be secretary of health [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=319.48s)]
*  and human services, something like that that would also encounter a lot of opposition. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=325.56s)]
*  Any one of these picks that is disruptive to or threatening of the establishment power [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=331.15999999999997s)]
*  and establishment dogma in any way, those are going to be the picks that generate the [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=337.15999999999997s)]
*  most upset. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=340.96s)]
*  And that's true of Republican senators as well, many of whom are more like David Frum [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=343.76s)]
*  and Bill Kristol and Liz Cheney than they are like the Trump wing of the Republican [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=349.12s)]
*  Party that they mow the loyalty to, but are really there to prevent and limit it from [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=352.96s)]
*  doing anything other than cutting corporate taxes and appointing corporate conservative [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=358.84000000000003s)]
*  judges to the Supreme Court. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=363.16s)]
*  That's about all they really care about. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=364.48s)]
*  Now I just want to conclude with this important question, which is, as I said, Donald Trump [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=366.44s)]
*  in 2016 ran on a promise to overhaul America's foreign policy. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=375.44s)]
*  He ramped it and raved against the evils of the Iraq War. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=380.56s)]
*  He talked constantly about the deep state, the U.S. security state, how subversive and [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=384.36s)]
*  corrupted they are, and that's only gotten more radicalized over the next many years. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=389.8s)]
*  He's often talked about the stupidity of wars, why are we in Syria trying to change our [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=398.48s)]
*  government, why are we in Ukraine spending all our money there, and that really has changed [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=403.28000000000003s)]
*  the face of the Republican Party. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=409.12s)]
*  And a lot of people who have been conservative for a long time in the Republican Party who [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=412.8s)]
*  believe in this more militaristic and neocon worldview have started to slightly transform [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=416.58s)]
*  it, abandon it, even repudiate it, whether that's because they're careerists knowing [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=424.2s)]
*  that they have to sound like Trump in order to get the kind of appointments they just [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=429.8s)]
*  got or whether it's because they really are starting to see the world a little bit differently. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=433.0s)]
*  It's impossible to know, but that definitely is what a lot of these people who we just [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=439.2s)]
*  covered who are being, I think, rightly characterized as being more warmonger, more establishment [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=443.84s)]
*  foreign policy adherents than certainly Donald Trump was, whether that they have really started [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=449.32s)]
*  to take a different turn and will continue to take a different term given that it's Donald [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=456.15999999999997s)]
*  Trump and not Marco Rubio or at least the fan that will be president. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=460.56s)]
*  The New York Times surprisingly published a very nuanced article about exactly this [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=464.16s)]
*  question and here's what the title was, quote, once they were neocons, now Trump's foreign [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=470.16s)]
*  policy picks are all quote America first. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=476.8s)]
*  Here's how the New York Times explored this question, quote, the Republican Party used [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=480.74s)]
*  to have a label for the kind of foreign policy hawk that President-elect Donald J. Trump [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=484.84000000000003s)]
*  named on Tuesday as his national security advisor and is considering as his secretary [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=489.76s)]
*  of state, meaning Marco Rubio, neocons. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=494.56s)]
*  But while they were once neocons, over the past few years, Representative Michael Walz [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=498.32s)]
*  and Senator Marco Rubio both of Florida have gradually shifted their positions. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=502.76s)]
*  Sounding less like former Vice President Dick Cheney or John Bolton, who served as Mr. Trump's [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=507.59999999999997s)]
*  third national security advisor, they no longer talk about foreign interventions or the prospect [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=512.28s)]
*  of regime change. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=517.26s)]
*  Instead, they speak the language of the America first movement and fit more comfortably within [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=519.1600000000001s)]
*  Mr. Trump's often erratic worldview in which deal making reigns over ideology. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=524.08s)]
*  They're saying that's a bad thing, his erratic worldview in which he prefers to make deals [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=529.88s)]
*  rather than go to war through ideology, which I think is one of the best things about Trump [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=535.2s)]
*  and hope that it finds expression. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=538.9200000000001s)]
*  The Times going on, quote, the result is that Mr. Trump may end up with a foreign policy [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=542.2800000000001s)]
*  team composed of deep loyalists, but with roots and familiar Republican approaches. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=546.2s)]
*  The shift that the two men have made, meaning his choice for national security advisor, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=552.0400000000001s)]
*  Mike Walz and the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, the shift that those two men have made [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=556.5200000000001s)]
*  reflects the broader marginalization of neocons throughout the Republican Party after the [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=561.4000000000001s)]
*  disaster in Iraq and the rise of America first. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=566.76s)]
*  Mr. Trump's loyalists and much of the party have now made a full conversion to that worldview [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=570.6400000000001s)]
*  few more enthusiastically than Pete Hegseth, the Fox News host who was chosen as defense [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=576.52s)]
*  secretary on Tuesday. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=582.6s)]
*  This is the New York Times quoting Pete Hegseth as the example of the person who used to have [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=584.56s)]
*  a neocon worldview and it was now shifted and abandoned that in the era of Donald Trump. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=591.3199999999999s)]
*  This is them quoting Pete Hegseth on this question, quote, I think a lot of us who are [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=597.1999999999999s)]
*  very hawkish and believe in American military might and strength were very resistant to [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=601.32s)]
*  how candidate Trump characterized the wars, meaning the war in Afghanistan and Iraq. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=607.48s)]
*  When he was criticizing him, he said, I'm very hawkish and I was very resistant to Trump's [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=611.6400000000001s)]
*  criticism of the war. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=617.96s)]
*  But then he went on, but if we are honest with ourselves, there is no doubt that we need [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=618.96s)]
*  to radically reorient how we do it, how much money we have invested, how many lives we [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=623.24s)]
*  have invested and how it actually has made us safer. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=628.32s)]
*  Is it still worth it? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=631.48s)]
*  For Mr. Rubio and Mr. Waltz, the drift from their previous positions to their current [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=633.48s)]
*  ones has been slow, evident in shadings of what they said at conservative conferences [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=637.24s)]
*  or in interviews on Fox and how they altered their votes at key moments in the past few [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=642.28s)]
*  years. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=646.64s)]
*  Ukraine has been a litmus test. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=648.12s)]
*  When Russia first invaded Ukraine in February 2022, Mr. Rubio, the number two on the Senate [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=649.12s)]
*  Intelligence Committee, applauded the rush to send arms, aid and intelligence to the [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=654.0s)]
*  Ukrainians. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=658.24s)]
*  So did Mr. Waltz, a former Green Beret who enthusiastically supported giving Zelensky [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=659.24s)]
*  everything he needed to drive Russian troops out. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=664.0s)]
*  But by this spring, for each of their own reasons, Mr. Rubio and Mr. Waltz voted against [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=667.52s)]
*  the last major aid package to support Ukraine. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=672.3199999999999s)]
*  And to justify their new position, Mr. Rubio declared that the United States could not [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=675.7199999999999s)]
*  afford to fight for Ukraine's freedom while illegal immigrants were coming over the southern [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=679.16s)]
*  border. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=683.64s)]
*  For his part, Mr. Waltz wrote in an opinion essay for Fox News that President Biden, quote, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=685.16s)]
*  has neither explained the American objective in Ukraine nor his strategy to achieve it. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=689.4399999999999s)]
*  Will American military spending continue until Ukraine has pushed Russia back to its pre-war [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=695.4s)]
*  boundaries, its pre-2014 boundaries, or until the Putin regime collapses? [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=699.6s)]
*  Nearly 10 years ago, when Mr. Rubio was running for the Republican nomination for president [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=705.64s)]
*  against Mr. Trump, the Florida senator spoke at the Council on Foreign Relations, the heart [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=708.6s)]
*  of the traditional foreign policy establishment. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=713.24s)]
*  He quoted John F. Kennedy and made the case that the younger Mr. Bush had made, that [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=716.24s)]
*  American power must, quote, be motivated by a desire to expand freedom rather than simply [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=720.44s)]
*  expand its own territory. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=726.36s)]
*  Quote, while America did not intend to become the world's indispensable power, said Senator [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=727.92s)]
*  Rubio, that is exactly what our economic and political freedoms have made us. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=732.28s)]
*  He castigated President Obama and the Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton for being too timid [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=737.36s)]
*  to face up to the dictators from Syria to China. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=742.4s)]
*  Quote, the free nations of the world will still look to America to champion our shared [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=745.12s)]
*  ideals. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=749.52s)]
*  That's pure neocon dogma. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=750.52s)]
*  And then the Times said this, quote, but today Mr. Rubio makes a different, more pragmatic [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=751.52s)]
*  and more Trumpian case, that the way to keep America out of its wars is to build up its [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=757.92s)]
*  strength, invest in key technologies and domestic supply chains for critical materials and use [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=763.52s)]
*  tariffs to block threatening imports. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=769.16s)]
*  Outside experts say Mr. Trump learned something from the chaos of the first term and has adjusted [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=772.16s)]
*  accordingly. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=776.7199999999999s)]
*  Quote, over the past eight years he has collected enough accolades to staff his foreign policy [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=777.7199999999999s)]
*  and national security team with like-minded officials. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=783.28s)]
*  Daniel W. Dresdner, a professor of international politics at the Fletcher School of Law and [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=786.8399999999999s)]
*  Diplomacy wrote this week in Foreign Affairs, quote, Trump is far less likely to meet resistance [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=791.68s)]
*  from his own political appointees. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=796.36s)]
*  Other checks on Trump's policies will also be weaker, he said, and the result will be, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=799.12s)]
*  quote, that the United States will speak with one voice on foreign policy and that voice [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=803.68s)]
*  will be Donald Trump's. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=809.04s)]
*  Now, I don't want to be nearly as rosy-eyed as the New York Times for whatever reason [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=811.04s)]
*  was in that article about the abandonment of neoconservative and warmongering ideology [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=818.2s)]
*  and the part of a lot of these choices that Trump has selected, such as Marco Rubio and [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=824.64s)]
*  Waltz and others, but I do think that it is absolutely true that the Republican Party [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=829.92s)]
*  has been remade in Donald Trump's image and the first term of his presidency contains [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=835.84s)]
*  some of Donald Trump taking strong control and insisting that things be done with the [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=845.08s)]
*  way he wants, but others being places where a lot of his appointees who had much different [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=849.96s)]
*  ideology than he did, who wanted to sabotage his ideology, ran circles around him. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=856.6800000000001s)]
*  So that's why I say I don't know the answer to the question of what this actually signals. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=861.76s)]
*  Will Trump at 78 years old, now eight years older than he was when he first took office [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=866.4000000000001s)]
*  in 2016, be energetic enough, vibrant enough, motivated enough, interested enough to take [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=870.48s)]
*  the reins and say, no, this is how foreign policy will be run? [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=876.6s)]
*  And if he isn't, will he deputize someone like JD Vance or Tulsi Gabbard or Power Mac [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=881.4399999999999s)]
*  Gates or other appointees that may be coming that definitely have a much different worldview? [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=890.28s)]
*  Or will Marco Rubio and Mike Huckabee and John Ratcliffe of the CIA and his national [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=895.42s)]
*  security adviser, Mike Waltz, simply be able to pretend all along that they were appeasing [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=904.24s)]
*  Trump but in reality they have the same warmongering mentality. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=909.28s)]
*  Let's go have war with China. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=912.84s)]
*  Let's go to war for Israel. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=913.92s)]
*  Let's banish and defeat Putin. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=915.5600000000001s)]
*  And they'll be able to just get their way. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=920.44s)]
*  No one knows the answers to those questions. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=921.84s)]
*  But that's why I say, well, I don't purport to have certainty about what these appointees [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=924.52s)]
*  will be. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=932.04s)]
*  I don't know what the second Trump administration will be. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=933.04s)]
*  And while I certainly dislike several of them, to put that mildly, I think to say, oh, this [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=934.36s)]
*  means that Trump's whole anti-intervention approach is a fraud, that's just partisan [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=940.4399999999999s)]
*  idiocy. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=946.5999999999999s)]
*  It's just very binary thinking. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=947.5999999999999s)]
*  And I think that a lot of these choices, as in your Times article suggests, are a lot [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=950.36s)]
*  more complex and nuanced, both in terms of what these people's beliefs are and how those [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=954.68s)]
*  even if as bad as they always were, will find expression if at all in the second Trump administration. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=959.48s)]
*  I think this is going to take a lot of vigilance to prevent the second Trump administration [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=965.64s)]
*  from falling into old traditional Republican foreign policy dogma that has been so destructive. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=969.88s)]
*  But it's still the same Donald Trump, the same instincts that he's always had. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=975.92s)]
*  And there are other people in the administration beginning with his vice president who very [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=979.0s)]
*  much have those same instincts, very much in conflict with Marco Rubio's of the world. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=983.6s)]
*  That will be how this all shakes out, how this all emerges. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=988.2800000000001s)]
*  And a lot of people who voted for Trump or supported Trump or even who didn't will have [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=993.2800000000001s)]
*  a lot of say, a lot of role in determining what this foreign policy ends up being. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hrKHs3Ukk&t=997.72s)]
