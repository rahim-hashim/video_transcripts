# Defending "Democracy?": Western Media Acknowledges Ukraine's History of Stifling Dissent
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [June 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s)
*  One of the constants when it comes to the effort by the American government and their [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=0.0s)]
*  media to sell a new war is that we are always told the war is about much more than geostrategic [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=11.16s)]
*  considerations or fights for money or resources or capital. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=17.92s)]
*  We're always told that we can feel good about the war because what we're really doing is [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  going to war in order to fight tyranny and help defend democracy. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=25.88s)]
*  We were told that about the war in Vietnam, that we were going to free the Vietnamese [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=32.44s)]
*  people from the government that they actually preferred. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=35.64s)]
*  We were told that in 2003 that we were going to invade Iraq in order to liberate the people [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=38.72s)]
*  there from Saddam Hussein and bring democracy to their country and therefore to the region. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  We were told that about the journey where we fought to dislodge Bashar al-Assad in Syria [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=49.4s)]
*  and Muammar Gaddafi in Libya. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=54.04s)]
*  Of course we are constantly told that and have from the beginning been told that about [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=56.959999999999994s)]
*  the war in Ukraine, that among the reasons we're there is because Ukraine is a pristine [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=62.16s)]
*  and important democracy that believes in freedom of speech and press, whereas the invaders [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=67.52s)]
*  are hardcore authoritarians who throw dissidents in prison, don't allow any oppositional media. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=74.3s)]
*  For a long time it's been so obvious that this is a propagandistic fraud that Ukraine [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=81.24s)]
*  itself and Zelensky in particular have long attacked and eroded and even shut down core [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=86.39999999999999s)]
*  basic rights of free speech and free press and dissent even before Russia invaded in [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=93.75999999999999s)]
*  February of 2022. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=99.11999999999999s)]
*  Since then, Ukraine has basically stopped even resembling a democracy at all and instead [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=100.89999999999999s)]
*  looks like the exact tyranny that it has long been. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=108.16s)]
*  If you had said this in February of 2022, pointed out that Ukraine and Zelensky are [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=112.08s)]
*  not Democrats with a small d or pointed this out all throughout 2023, you would be immediately [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=116.44s)]
*  accused of being a Russian propagandist, of a Kremlin agent because you're spreading Kremlin [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=123.88s)]
*  propaganda by attacking Zelensky in Ukraine, something that was so prohibited. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=129.44s)]
*  Here we are two and a half years into this war and even the very media outlets that rendered [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=135.35999999999999s)]
*  those views taboo, criticism of Zelensky in Ukraine, arguments that there's no democracy [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=141.52s)]
*  in Ukraine at all are now finally having to acknowledge it and cover it because even many [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=147.0s)]
*  people inside Ukraine are screaming and yelling and denouncing Zelensky for attacking basic [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=153.2s)]
*  free press rights, including journalists who had long supported Zelensky in the war. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=161.72s)]
*  Here from the New York Times, the paper of record on June 18th, quote, a big step back [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=166.16s)]
*  in Ukraine concerns mount over narrowing press freedoms, quote, journalists say they are [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=173.32s)]
*  subject to increasing restrictions and pressure from the government of President Vladimir [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=178.68s)]
*  Zelensky, adding that the measures go beyond wartime security needs, quote, a Ukrainian [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=182.72s)]
*  reporter who revealed that a state news agency tried to bar interviews with opposition politicians [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=188.64s)]
*  said he received a draft notification the very next day. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=194.88s)]
*  Ukraine's domestic spy agencies spied on staff members of an investigative news outlet [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=199.32s)]
*  through peep holes in their hotel rooms. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=204.07999999999998s)]
*  The public broadcaster has decried what it says is political pressure on its reporting. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=206.84s)]
*  Journalists in groups monitoring press freedoms are raising alarms over what they say are [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=212.16s)]
*  increasing restrictions and pressures on the media in Ukraine under the government of President [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=215.72s)]
*  Zelensky that go well beyond the country's wartime needs. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=220.56s)]
*  Journalists and media groups say that a string of recent cases have pointed to an increasingly [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=224.96s)]
*  restrictive reporting environment. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=228.96s)]
*  Analysts say the government's effort to control the media appear to be aimed at crimping positive [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=232.2s)]
*  coverage of the opposition and suppressing negative coverage of the government in the [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=236.76s)]
*  military. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=242.04s)]
*  Reporters for the state news agency, Ukraine form, which is supposed to be nonpartisan, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=243.96s)]
*  received a list from their management late last year of opposition figures and local [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=250.68s)]
*  elected officials labeled, quote, undesirable. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=253.84s)]
*  For quoting in articles, in the city of Odessa, reporters were instructed to cite only presidential [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=257.64s)]
*  appointees in some cases. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=262.36s)]
*  In Lviv, reporters were told to avoid quoting the elected mayor, Andrei Sadavyi, a prominent [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=264.88s)]
*  politician seen as a possible future candidate for the presidency. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=271.36s)]
*  Ukraine's raucous and competitive television news landscape before the war was consolidated [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=277.04s)]
*  by Mr. Zelensky's government into a single state-controlled broadcast. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=281.92s)]
*  After Russia's invasion, the government presented the arrangement, known as telemarathon, as [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=287.32s)]
*  necessary for airing reliable news during the war. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=292.58s)]
*  But it excluded opposition channels and ran such consistently upbeat reports, even as [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=297.3s)]
*  fighting bogged down that a majority of Ukrainians now say they do not trust it. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=302.76s)]
*  A U.S. State Department report said the program had, quote, enabled an unprecedented level [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=308.24s)]
*  of control over prime-time television news in Ukraine. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=314.0s)]
*  Does any of that sound remotely like a democracy? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=320.2s)]
*  Now of course the argument that Zelensky is making is one that all tyrants and authoritarians [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=324.24s)]
*  make, namely that you can't afford to give freedom to the citizenry whenever there's [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=329.20000000000005s)]
*  a threat to national security. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=333.96000000000004s)]
*  That was of course the argument that George Bush and Dick Cheney constantly made for eroding [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=335.76000000000005s)]
*  the basic constitutional rights and liberties of American citizens by saying we're involved [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=340.28000000000003s)]
*  in a war, a global war on terror, and we can't have the same kind of rights, like the right [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=344.40000000000003s)]
*  not to be spied on by our government without warrants, the right to due process if we're [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=349.02000000000004s)]
*  going to be arrested. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=352.36s)]
*  And it was all justified by the war. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=354.68s)]
*  I think one of the lessons we've learned as Americans, in fact over many decades, going [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=356.36s)]
*  back to World War II when Japanese Americans were interned in camps and all the way back [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=360.76s)]
*  to World War I when Woodrow Wilson succeeded in enacting the Espionage Act of 1917 that [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=365.84000000000003s)]
*  criminalized dissent against his policy of involving the U.S. in World War I and people [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=371.88s)]
*  were actually imprisoned for questioning Woodrow Wilson's war policies is that even in times [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=377.40000000000003s)]
*  of crises and in times of war, the Constitution is not suspended. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=384.46000000000004s)]
*  Elections still get held. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=389.98s)]
*  People still have basic rights of due process and free speech. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=391.66s)]
*  But even if you want to believe, if you want to give Zelensky credit, oh yes, he has turned [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=396.02000000000004s)]
*  Ukraine into something other than a democracy, it's now a tyranny, but that's only because [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=400.66s)]
*  there's a war going on. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=405.34000000000003s)]
*  It'll revert right back to the freedom-loving country that it was under Zelensky before the [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=406.54s)]
*  Russian invasion. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=412.68s)]
*  You should recognize that even before the Russian invasion, Zelensky was exhibiting [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=413.68s)]
*  all kinds of tyrannical behaviors, including cracking down and closing media outlets by [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=419.88s)]
*  accusing them of being too sympathetic to Russia. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=425.68s)]
*  Here from Reuters on December 15, 2021, so there's three months before the Russian invasion, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=428.72s)]
*  there you see the headline, Ukraine's crackdown on media, assembly violates rights, says the [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=435.6s)]
*  Ukraine's government has restricted media and freedom of expression and peaceful assembly [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=442.56s)]
*  violating international law, the UN Human Rights Office said on Wednesday. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=447.7s)]
*  The finding by the UN Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights, Neda Al-Nashif, was presented [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=452.06s)]
*  in a debate at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva amid mounting tensions between Ukraine [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=457.21999999999997s)]
*  and Russia. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=462.29999999999995s)]
*  Ukraine's closure of television channels and online media outlets were, quote, not in line [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=464.14s)]
*  with international human rights law. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=468.41999999999996s)]
*  Press journalists and critics have been persecuted for challenging Kiev government narratives [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=471.66s)]
*  or investigating corruption, and opposition political parties were under attack, she said [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=475.72s)]
*  in a report documenting incidents since 2019. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=480.84000000000003s)]
*  It's three years, three years before the Russian invasion. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=486.04s)]
*  Now, again, does anyone believe that we're actually in Ukraine to save democracy? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=491.16s)]
*  We don't go to war in order to save democracy or defend democracy. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=498.7s)]
*  We have no problem at all with tyranny, as long as the tyrants are pro-American. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=501.74s)]
*  That's why we are allies and partners with some of the most tyrannical regimes on the [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=507.66s)]
*  planet, Saudi Arabia and Egypt, the Gulf States and many more, and that's exactly what our [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=511.18s)]
*  position is regarding Ukraine. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=515.84s)]
*  The idea that we're fighting for Ukrainian democracy is the pretext for the war. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=518.32s)]
*  It is never the actual reason, in part because Ukraine and Zelensky are not democratically [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=523.54s)]
*  inclined at all. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=529.02s)]
*  In fact, you can go back all the way to February of 2021, more than a year before the Russian [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=531.4s)]
*  invasion in 2022, and here is DW, the German news site. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=538.18s)]
*  Ukraine bans pro-Russian TV stations. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=544.36s)]
*  Quote, three pro-Russian TV channels have gone off the air in Kiev after pro-Western [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=547.18s)]
*  president Vladimir Zelensky signed a Ukrainian Security Council decree imposing sanctions [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=552.4200000000001s)]
*  for five years on eight media and TV companies. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=558.86s)]
*  The Kiev stations affected were ZIK, News One and 112 Ukraine. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=563.22s)]
*  Their broadcasts were only available Tuesday night via the video hosting platform YouTube, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=568.9s)]
*  reported the Russian news agency TASS. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=573.5s)]
*  It identified the channel's owner as Taras Kozak, a lawmaker and member of the pro-Russian [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=575.46s)]
*  opposition platform for LifeParty, quoting him as describing Zelensky's move as, quote, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=580.9599999999999s)]
*  an act of blatant censorship. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=587.4799999999999s)]
*  Now, remember that the eastern part of Ukraine and the people who live there are overwhelmingly [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=590.0s)]
*  pro-Moscow and pro-Russia. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=599.38s)]
*  And of course, their views should be represented in oppositional media outlets that have a [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=601.12s)]
*  different view to the pro-Western inclinations of Zelensky. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=608.0s)]
*  But long before the Russians invaded, he banned all those media outlets. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=612.52s)]
*  He closed them. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=615.8399999999999s)]
*  He decreed them no longer online. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=617.68s)]
*  The idea that this war was sold to us as going to protect Ukrainian democracy and Vladimir [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=621.0s)]
*  Zelensky as a flourishing democracy is laughable. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=625.8s)]
*  Now, on top of that, in June of 2023, this was not very well discussed. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=631.5999999999999s)]
*  Zelensky himself announced that there will be no more elections in Ukraine indefinitely [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=637.3199999999999s)]
*  until he decides that elections can be safely had once the war is over. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=644.92s)]
*  In other words, Zelensky, who was in power, declared himself indefinitely in power, not [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=649.9599999999999s)]
*  able to be removed by the Ukrainian people because he has banned elections in Ukraine [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=655.72s)]
*  and cited a constitutional provision that he says allows that, whether that's true or [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=662.32s)]
*  not. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=667.12s)]
*  Banning elections indefinitely, declaring yourself in power, no matter what people think, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=669.16s)]
*  especially when polls show that there's a lot of discontent with Zelensky, is the very [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=673.84s)]
*  opposite of what democracy entails. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=678.5600000000001s)]
*  Here's the video where Zelensky in June of 2023 announces that there will be no more [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=681.24s)]
*  Ukrainian elections for the indefinite future. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=687.16s)]
*  Will there be elections in Ukraine next year is the question. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=693.2s)]
*  The answer, this is a global question, Zelensky says. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=695.76s)]
*  If we win, there will be. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=698.24s)]
*  So there will be no wartime martial law, no war. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=700.72s)]
*  Elections should be held in peacetime when there is no war, according to the law. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=704.64s)]
*  And that's why this is so. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=712.08s)]
*  In other words, no, there won't be any elections at all. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=713.88s)]
*  We basically have martial law. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=717.8s)]
*  We're under a state of war, and therefore I'll be the president for the indefinite future. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=719.24s)]
*  Now, again, if you had talked about Ukraine and its government as attacking basic constitutional [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=727.24s)]
*  rights at any point over the last two years, even though it was commonly acknowledged over [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=733.24s)]
*  and over in the Western press before that, you would be instantly stigmatized as a Russian [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=737.76s)]
*  agent if you were a professor with a specialty in Ukraine, as some of our guests have been, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=743.08s)]
*  and you didn't support this idea that Zelensky was this noble, patriotic leader fighting [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=748.88s)]
*  for Ukrainian democracy. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=755.12s)]
*  You just wouldn't be heard from in the media. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=756.12s)]
*  In the New York Times, in the NPR, on any news stations, you'd be excluded, as John [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=758.48s)]
*  Mearsheimer has talked about, as he was, as other Ukrainian specialists have talked about [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=764.36s)]
*  they were, for simply having a dissident view. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=769.24s)]
*  It was a one-view Western media narrative, and nothing else was allowed. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=772.56s)]
*  One of the other key facts about this war that has been utterly suppressed in Western [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=778.32s)]
*  media discussions is the fact that Ukraine and Russia were negotiating a peace deal very [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=785.0s)]
*  early on in the war, in February and March of 2022, and those negotiations were ongoing [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=793.0s)]
*  and extensive, and came very, very close to actually a peace deal, to averting the [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=801.12s)]
*  need for this war. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=808.52s)]
*  Ukraine would have just simply declared itself neutral, that they weren't going to join NATO, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=810.88s)]
*  that they would be a neutral buffer zone between Russia on the one hand and the West on the [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=815.36s)]
*  other, and that would have satisfied the Russians, along with granting certain forms of liberty [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=820.28s)]
*  and autonomy to the Russian-speaking ethnic Russians in the eastern part of Ukraine, who [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=827.0s)]
*  don't want to be part of the centralized government in Kiev, which is why they've been declaring [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=831.48s)]
*  and fighting a war of independence, a separatist war, since 2014, when there was this coup, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=836.68s)]
*  when the elected Ukrainian president was removed with the support of the United States. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=842.96s)]
*  Now here is finally the New York Times, this week, or last week rather, June 15th, not [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=848.68s)]
*  only admitting that these negotiations took place, but describing in detail how close [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=854.0s)]
*  they actually got. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=859.24s)]
*  The headline was, Ukraine-Russian peace is as elusive as ever. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=860.32s)]
*  But in 2022, they were talking, quote, representatives from the warring nations held peace talks [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=866.48s)]
*  in the early weeks of the Russian invasion. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=871.6600000000001s)]
*  They fizzled. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=874.76s)]
*  Documents from those talks show why any new ones will face major obstacles. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=876.36s)]
*  An examination of the document shows that the two sides clashed over issues involving [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=879.76s)]
*  weapons levels, the term of Ukraine's potential membership in the EU, and specific Ukrainian [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=884.3199999999999s)]
*  laws on language and culture that Russia wanted repealed. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=890.54s)]
*  Ukraine's negotiators offered to forego NATO membership and to accept Russian occupation [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=894.8s)]
*  of parts of their territory, but they refused to recognize Russian sovereignty over them. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=899.8s)]
*  In Istanbul, the Russians seemed to endorse Ukraine's model of neutrality and security [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=905.12s)]
*  guarantees and put less emphasis on their territorial demands. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=910.74s)]
*  That is, extremely close to a full agreement on all major issues. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=914.26s)]
*  Afterward, Mr. Medinsky, Russia's lead negotiator, said Ukraine's offer of neutrality meant [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=919.12s)]
*  it was, quote, ready to fulfill those principal demands that Russia insisted on for all the [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=924.5600000000001s)]
*  past years, that they were hearing from Ukraine, were willing to give you the key things you [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=929.24s)]
*  want in order to avert this war. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=934.44s)]
*  Ukraine summarized the proposed deal in a two-page document it called the Istanbul Communique, [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=937.6400000000001s)]
*  which it never published. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=942.72s)]
*  The status of Crimea was to be decided over a 10- to 15-year period, with Ukraine promising [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=943.8000000000001s)]
*  not to try to retake the peninsula by force. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=949.0400000000001s)]
*  Mr. Zelensky and Mr. Putin would meet in person to finalize a peace treaty and strike a deal [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=952.24s)]
*  on how much Ukrainian territory Russia would continue to occupy. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=958.08s)]
*  Think about what would happen if Ukraine and Russia had entered a peace deal in February [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=964.2s)]
*  and March of 2022, as they got very close to doing. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=968.88s)]
*  Think about hundreds of thousands of lives, Ukrainian lives and Russian lives, that would [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=971.6s)]
*  have been saved. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=978.5200000000001s)]
*  Massive destruction in Ukraine could have been averted. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=980.96s)]
*  The United States and other Western countries spending hundreds of billions of dollars to [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=984.5600000000001s)]
*  and arming it would have been unnecessary, and Russia wouldn't have been dragged into [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=989.62s)]
*  a war, an enduring, sustained war, that caused them to focus all their attention on building [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=994.86s)]
*  their military. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=1002.0600000000001s)]
*  The problem, of course, was that that was exactly what the West wanted. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=1004.86s)]
*  Whether you believe or not that the West provoked Russia to interfere in eastern Ukraine, there [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=1008.14s)]
*  are documents at the highest levels of the U.S. government that made very clear for a [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=1016.02s)]
*  long time that everyone in Washington knew that if you talk too much about Ukrainian [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=1019.98s)]
*  membership in NATO, it will provoke the Russians to invade eastern Ukraine and Crimea. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=1025.66s)]
*  Leave aside that question of whether the West provoked it deliberately or even unintentionally. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=1033.1399999999999s)]
*  The reality is there was a serious chance to avoid a horrific and destructive war, and [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=1037.1399999999999s)]
*  the New York Times is finally acknowledging how close the Ukrainians and Russians got [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=1045.14s)]
*  to that kind of a deal. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=1051.18s)]
*  They showed you the documents where both sides seemed very pleased with how much progress [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=1053.18s)]
*  the other side was being made with concessions from the other side. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=1058.1000000000001s)]
*  Now what the New York Times did not mention is the reason that peace deal never happened, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=1061.18s)]
*  and that was because Western leaders, particularly the U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=1070.3s)]
*  President Joe Biden, intervened to impede, prevent, and even ban Ukraine from pursuing [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=1076.06s)]
*  that kind of peace deal. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=1083.26s)]
*  Here from Ukranskia Pravda in October 21, 2023, quote, former German Chancellor claims [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=1085.98s)]
*  he, quote, mediated the situation between Ukraine and Russia in 2022. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=1093.1399999999999s)]

*  him to mediate. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=1114.26s)]
*  The former Chancellor also mentioned the five points of what was supposedly a peace plan [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=1115.86s)]
*  being discussed at the time, Ukraine's rejection of NATO membership, two official languages [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=1120.8999999999999s)]

*  Crimea, which is very similar to what the New York Times reported, quote, the only people [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=1131.82s)]
*  who could resolve the war over Ukraine are the Americans. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=1135.86s)]
*  During the peace talks in March of 2022 in Istanbul, Ukrainians did not agree to peace [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=1139.5s)]

*  They had to coordinate everything they talked about with the Americans first, Schröder [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=1147.9399999999998s)]

*  and was published on Sunday, Bennett said that after the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=1199.06s)]

*  Now we've covered this many times. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=1251.96s)]
*  There's a lot of other aspects to this war, including the increasing levels of violent [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=1253.22s)]
*  Ukrainian resistance, to being drafted. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=1257.6s)]
*  Ukrainians increasingly are hiding in their own apartments, avoiding taking the bus, hiding [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=1263.52s)]
*  and fleeing from Ukrainian recruitment officers because of how unwilling they are to go to [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=1269.28s)]
*  war. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=1275.28s)]
*  We've heard anecdotes and anecdotes and anecdotes. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=1276.28s)]
*  The BBC had a video report that they published just last week extensively documenting how [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=1278.1599999999999s)]
*  pervasive this has become. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=1285.76s)]
*  Again, all things that have been visible and obvious for quite some time, and I think the [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=1287.76s)]
*  most important one is how close Ukraine and Russia got to a peace deal two and a half [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=1294.76s)]
*  years ago that the United States and NATO allies, specifically Britain, purposely disrupted [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=1300.3999999999999s)]
*  because they wanted Russia to be entrapped in a war, or as Naftali Bennett put it, they [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=1308.76s)]
*  preferred to crush Putin than to allow the Ukrainians to forge a peace deal. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=1315.44s)]
*  That is morally repugnant. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=1322.24s)]
*  And even if you believe that the Russians are to blame for having invaded, the failure [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=1325.16s)]
*  of the two sides to come to a peace deal when they were so close is obviously on the ledger [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=1330.24s)]
*  of Joe Biden, another thing that's on his ledger. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=1335.24s)]
*  He wanted this war to be prolonged indefinitely. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=1338.6200000000001s)]
*  That's why he funded it and armed it to the very end. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=1341.92s)]
*  And of course, the people who have paid the largest price are the very people that we [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=1345.16s)]
*  were told we were going there to save, which are the Ukrainians, in defense of a democracy [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=1349.24s)]
*  which under Zelensky has long ceased to exist. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q2kXv1hH8s&t=1353.8400000000001s)]
