# Prof. Norman Finkelstein: An Israeli Ground War Against Hezbollah Would Be A "Catastrophe"
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [September 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk)
*  What I guess surprised me was that about six weeks ago, it was being said as though it [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=0.0s)]
*  was a fait accompli that Iran was going to retaliate against Israel and this time for [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=14.700000000000001s)]
*  real, not with its full force, but in a way that would actually make an impact, unlike [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=21.6s)]
*  the fake retaliation they did after the Damascus bombing and yet that retaliation never came. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=25.84s)]
*  And even now with a lot of missiles, these vaunted Hezbollah missiles being shot into [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=32.72s)]
*  Israel, it's doing a little damage to some buildings, but I think there hasn't even been [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=38.2s)]
*  a single Israeli casualty yet. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=41.879999999999995s)]
*  Is the force capability and the power, the military power of Iran and Hezbollah really [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=44.519999999999996s)]
*  as formidable as we've been hearing or do they have real fear about retaliating in a [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=51.0s)]
*  way that they might want to do? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=58.88s)]
*  I have to always enter the caveat that I am not a military historian. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=63.44s)]
*  Frankly, military matters don't very much interest me. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=68.56s)]
*  But having said that, I have to make some comment on this subject since it's so obviously [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=72.92s)]
*  germane to the situation now. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=80.56s)]
*  In the case of Iran, Iran is a very conservative country and at the risk of making generalizations, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=83.60000000000001s)]
*  which sound a little bit too abstract, there's a very different way in which countries like [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=90.04s)]
*  Iran, which have a rich civilization spanning thousands of years, or China and countries [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=95.36000000000001s)]
*  in the West, the Iranians and the Chinese having this civilization of heritage, they [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=103.92s)]
*  tend to be much more long term in their thinking and long term also means a lot more patient. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=111.48s)]
*  And so they don't feel the kinds of needs for, we can use the expression, the same kinds [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=119.08s)]
*  of needs for instant gratification that Westerners tend to have. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=125.92s)]
*  So Iran is confident that they will prevail because of their civilization, because of [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=131.84s)]
*  the sheer demographic weight, the geographic weight of their country, that they will prevail [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=138.84s)]
*  in the long term. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=145.6s)]
*  And that basically means they slowly move their chess pieces on the board. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=147.2s)]
*  I forgot the expression that's used. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=153.48000000000002s)]
*  It's called something like a ring of fire. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=155.4s)]
*  I could be using the wrong expression. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=158.68s)]
*  That they will surround Israel with the various, the expression is you can call it proxies, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=162.12s)]
*  collaborators, allies, whichever term you want, and slowly but surely build up a force [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=169.4s)]
*  sufficient to, I'll use the term not in the literal sense, but in the metaphorical sense [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=177.72s)]
*  to extinguish Israel. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=185.56s)]
*  And so they're always been very slow to react for those reasons and also just prudence. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=189.79999999999998s)]
*  It's just not, there's no necessity to act right now. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=197.8s)]
*  On the other hand, Israel is perfectly aware of that strategy. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=205.72s)]
*  They talk about it. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=211.2s)]
*  And so they feel they have to act now in order to disable that ring that's being built up [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=213.04s)]
*  around them. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=224.32s)]
*  And so now Iran, just like after the Gulf War, Iran knows if Hezbollah falls, they fall. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=225.32s)]
*  There's no question about that. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=235.6s)]
*  The only thing that stopped the attack in Iran was that Iraq turned into a disaster. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=237.6s)]
*  Otherwise Iran would have been attacked by Cheney and Rumsfeld. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=243.12s)]
*  That was very clear at the time. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=246.04s)]
*  So Iran recognizes now it's a moment of reckoning for it. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=248.64s)]
*  There's a real problem for them because they're the third in line, Gaza, Hezbollah, Iran. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=253.2s)]
*  If you were to ask me about the issue of military capabilities, my guess is as follows. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=261.28s)]
*  Number one, very unusual for Hezbollah and for its leader, Assad Nisrallah, whose speeches [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=268.4s)]
*  I always follow closely because they are in many ways quite educational, they're quite [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=275.32s)]
*  instructive. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=280.15999999999997s)]
*  In his last few speeches, unusual for him, very unusual. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=281.15999999999997s)]
*  He is very frank in his speeches. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=287.59999999999997s)]
*  In the last speech he said, number one, he said, Israel has the technological edge. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=290.72s)]
*  It's very unusual for an Arab leader, especially a proud Arab leader like Nisrallah, to frankly [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=297.84000000000003s)]
*  say they're ahead of us. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=304.36s)]
*  Israel has the technological edge. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=307.04s)]
*  And number two, he said that we did suffer a major blow with the penetration of our intelligence. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=309.84000000000003s)]
*  He was very frank about that. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=320.32s)]
*  So that to me is not unusual for him. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=322.36s)]
*  He is instructive and instructive because he is a frank, he's probably by far the frankest [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=325.52s)]
*  and most impressive political leader on the world stage. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=332.86s)]
*  But what was surprising was almost to the point of a plea, almost to the point of a [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=338.03999999999996s)]
*  plea, he kept saying, we will stop the retaliation if you agree to a ceasefire in Gaza. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=350.04s)]
*  We will stop the retaliation if you agree to a ceasefire in Gaza. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=359.48s)]
*  And it was almost, as I said, it almost, I don't want to offend him, but it almost came [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=365.16s)]
*  out as a plea. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=372.0s)]
*  We don't want this war. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=374.20000000000005s)]
*  So on the one hand, when you talk about the limited damage, it may be that they're desperately [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=378.34s)]
*  looking for what's the expression, an exit ramp. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=386.32s)]
*  They're looking for an exit ramp. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=390.94s)]
*  I don't believe it's possible for the reasons I've already explained. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=392.97999999999996s)]
*  But there's a second aspect to it. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=398.29999999999995s)]
*  It's very easy to understand what their strategy is because Israel wins hands down in the air [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=401.14s)]
*  assault. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=411.82s)]
*  No question about that. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=412.82s)]
*  There's no state in the Middle East that can compete with the Israeli Air Force. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=415.41999999999996s)]
*  However, Israel loses hands down in a ground invasion. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=422.02s)]
*  And Israel dreads a ground invasion for the very simple reason that, believe it or not, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=430.3s)]
*  Israelis don't want to die. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=439.86s)]
*  They like to kill. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=441.82s)]
*  It's fun to kill Arabs. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=443.58000000000004s)]
*  It's more fun than shooting fish in a barrel. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=447.18s)]
*  They are positively exhilarated and euphoric at the prospect of killing Arabs, including [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=453.46s)]
*  children. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=464.78s)]
*  They like to shoot children in the skull, as was fairly common according to physicians [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=465.78s)]
*  who served in the hospitals in Gaza the past year. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=474.38s)]
*  They said children came in without any shrapnel on their body, just bullets to their head. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=481.22s)]
*  And during the Great March of Return in 2018, as the UN report, an exhaustive 250-page [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=489.74s)]
*  single-spaced report, said, Israel targeted children. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=498.98s)]
*  And in particular, when it didn't kill them, because killing too many unarmed children [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=506.78s)]
*  doesn't fly too well in the press to the extent that it's covered, they targeted their knee [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=512.5799999999999s)]
*  caps and below their knee caps to inflict what are called life-changing injuries. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=519.42s)]
*  In any event, Israelis like to kill Arabs, humiliate Arabs, degrade Arabs, torture Arabs, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=527.38s)]
*  but it doesn't like to fight them. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=536.34s)]
*  In particular, they don't want to fight the party of God. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=538.7s)]
*  Nasrallah said in his speech a couple of months ago that there are over 100,000 militants [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=543.1s)]
*  now in Hezbollah. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=552.62s)]
*  I can't say with any certainty whether that figure is accurate, but obviously, where it's [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=554.46s)]
*  true, it's a very large number. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=560.02s)]
*  So what Israel does is it goes in and it annihilates, it decimates, it pulverizes, but it doesn't [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=562.7s)]
*  launch the ground invasion. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=572.62s)]
*  If you recall, when October 7th, they started massing troops on the border the day after, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=575.46s)]
*  beginning October 8th. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=584.0200000000001s)]
*  But if you recall, they didn't actually launch the ground invasion until October 27th because [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=586.14s)]
*  they needed two weeks, closer to three weeks, to totally decimate everything in front of [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=594.54s)]
*  them, to turn it all, to reduce it all to dust so there would be no resistance. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=604.02s)]
*  If you look at the actual numbers, and in case you haven't noticed, Israel never gives [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=611.38s)]
*  out its casualty figures the past year. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=616.78s)]
*  How many soldiers were killed? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=620.02s)]
*  You couldn't find that anywhere. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=622.14s)]
*  They did say a couple of weeks ago that we have now had more soldiers killed in the past [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=624.3s)]
*  11 months, 10 months, as were killed on October 7th. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=632.58s)]
*  On October 7th, 313 Israeli soldiers were killed. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=639.1s)]
*  The estimates are 313 soldiers and the rest civilians, about 800 civilians. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=643.86s)]
*  Well that would mean, if you do very simple math, that would mean less than one Israeli [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=648.8199999999999s)]
*  was, well, about one Israeli was killed every day. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=653.54s)]
*  One. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=657.18s)]
*  One Israeli was killed every day. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=658.18s)]
*  There was no war in, there was no ground war in Gaza. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=661.5s)]
*  There was an aerial annihilation in Gaza. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=665.66s)]
*  So Israel is hoping it can knock out Lebanon by air. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=670.3399999999999s)]
*  The Hezbollah strategy, it's perfectly obvious, they will keep shooting rockets at Israel. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=676.02s)]
*  However, they're not going to let out a huge blitz. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=683.5799999999999s)]
*  Every time Israel declares victory over Hezbollah, they will fire more rockets. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=689.7s)]
*  Israel will then inflict more aerial destruction, declare victory, and then Hezbollah will fire [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=699.0200000000001s)]
*  more rockets in order to make the situation politically untenable for Israel and they'll [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=707.98s)]
*  have to launch the ground invasion. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=717.74s)]
*  Now if you listen to Nisra'allah's last speech, he said, literally, he said, please invade. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=720.4200000000001s)]
*  Please invade. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=730.38s)]
*  We welcome the invasion, which is true. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=732.34s)]
*  If it's a hundred thousand or it's seventy five thousand, the party of God longs for, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=736.66s)]
*  yearns for that invasion so they can finally settle the score with that satanic state, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=746.02s)]
*  man to man, in hand combat. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=758.9399999999999s)]
*  So the Israelis dread the aerial assault, excuse me, dread the land war. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=763.54s)]
*  Hezbollah longs for it and the only way it can force the land war is to keep its rockets [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=775.02s)]
*  and missiles in reserve and deny Netanyahu the chance to declare victory. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=785.22s)]
*  That's what happened in 2006. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=795.7s)]
*  Israel amassed the troops on its border with Lebanon and it wasn't until seventy two hours [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=799.0600000000001s)]
*  before, it was thirty three days that war. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=810.78s)]
*  It wasn't until seventy two hours before the war was over that the troops entered Lebanon, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=814.42s)]
*  the Israeli troops, when already Condoleezza Rice had gotten a UN resolution through ending [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=821.78s)]
*  the war because Israel begged the US, get that resolution, get that resolution because [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=831.3399999999999s)]
*  we don't want the land invasion. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=839.38s)]
*  It will be a disaster and of that, speaking as a complete political, excuse me, military [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=843.26s)]
*  know nothing, speaking as a complete military ignoramus, I would say with one hundred percent [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=852.58s)]
*  certainty it will be, if it comes to pass, it will be a catastrophe for the state of [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=866.18s)]
*  Israel because those people have no fear, no dread of giving their lives to finally [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=877.18s)]
*  settling the score with that monstrous state that has inflicted so much death and destruction, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=890.34s)]
*  agony and anguish with all the haughtiness and arrogance of the uber mention. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=901.9s)]
*  Just as the Soviet Red Army inflicted those final wounds on those Nazi uber mention that [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=915.5s)]
*  had invaded their country, it was very ugly for Germany at the end of the war. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=927.3s)]
*  As you know, there was the mass rapes of German women. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=934.34s)]
*  The Red Army was going to settle the score with those monsters who had murdered 30 million [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=938.66s)]
*  of their people. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=949.98s)]
*  And it's the same thing with the party of God. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=951.9s)]
*  So the question is, will Israel, how much death and destruction it will inflict from [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=956.3399999999999s)]
*  the air? [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=966.82s)]
*  And secondly, whether they will be forced because they will deny Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=968.74s)]
*  the ability to declare victory? [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=978.94s)]
*  I should note in the 2006 war, Hezbollah on the very last day, on the 33rd day, fired [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=981.38s)]
*  missiles and rockets than any other day in that 33 day war. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=995.18s)]
*  I think you can correct me. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=1001.3s)]
*  I think it was 10,000. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=1003.38s)]
*  It wanted to transmit the message, you lost. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=1006.4599999999999s)]
*  And I think they're going to do the same thing this time. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=1012.7399999999999s)]
*  They will hold back. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=1016.5799999999999s)]
*  That's my guess. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arUHCv1iXgk&t=1018.38s)]
