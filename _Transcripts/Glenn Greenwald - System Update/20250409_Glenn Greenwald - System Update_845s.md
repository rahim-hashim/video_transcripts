# Ben Shapiro Outraged Over Trump Tariffs?
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [April 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM)
*  So yesterday Netanyahu arrived in DC for what the Times of Israel called [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=0.0s)]
*  hastily arranged talks with Trump about tariffs, hostages, and more. And nominally [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=13.64s)]
*  the idea was the Trump tariff plan included 17% tariffs on Israel even [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=19.8s)]
*  though the Israelis anticipating these tariffs said, oh don't worry we're not [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=26.28s)]
*  going to put up any more tariffs against your products. Can you imagine the audacity of that? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=29.96s)]
*  We've been funding their military. We automatically give them four billion [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=34.36s)]
*  dollars every year under an agreement negotiated on the way out by Obama and [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=38.24s)]
*  Netanyahu. And then on top of that when they have new wars we pass by a huge [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=42.760000000000005s)]
*  bipartisan margin, massive new funding that we sent to them to pay for their [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=49.2s)]
*  wars, to pay for their military. Some of that military aid, a good amount of it, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  the four million every year has to be used to buy American weapons but not all [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=58.88s)]
*  of it. They can spend it on what they want. All as Israelis have a higher standard of [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=62.160000000000004s)]
*  living than millions of Americans in terms of access to health care and [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=67.60000000000001s)]
*  college, subsidized education, but the American worker nonetheless is forced to [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=71.32000000000001s)]
*  subsidize them and then at the same time that we're doing that and constantly [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=76.72s)]
*  using our veto at the UN to protect them, they're putting tariffs against American [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=82.52000000000001s)]
*  products so that they keep their products, American products out of our [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=88.12s)]
*  market. So this was an anticipation of what the meeting was supposed to be. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=92.04s)]
*  Quote, the meeting will largely focus on the ongoing war in the Gaza Strip and the [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=99.88000000000001s)]
*  hostages of whom 59 are still in captivity as well as Trump's new tariff [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=103.72s)]
*  policy under which Israel goods facing 17% US tariff. Netanyahu's office has [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=108.76s)]
*  also said that quote, the Israeli-Turkey relations, the Iranian threat and [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=114.04s)]
*  confronting the International Criminal Court will be on the agenda. Trump told [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=117.84s)]
*  reporters on Sunday quote, we're going to talk about trade, we're going to talk [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=121.68s)]
*  about the obvious subject, you know what the obvious subject is right, obviously [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=124.92s)]
*  meaning Iran. This was interpreted in Israel as [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=128.16s)]
*  likely referring either to the hostages held in Gaza or to Iran's nuclear program. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=131.92000000000002s)]
*  The premier departed, the Israeli premier from Washington from Budapest on Sunday [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=136.0s)]
*  less than 24 hours after the trip was announced. There's two interesting issues [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=140.64s)]
*  there too that I just want to point out. One is that when the International [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=147.27999999999997s)]
*  Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin for war crimes, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=151.32s)]
*  everyone in Europe stood up and cheered. This is what the ICC is for and small [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=156.11999999999998s)]
*  countries that are signatories to the ICC felt obligated to honor it even if [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=162.83999999999997s)]
*  they didn't agree with it. For example, the South African government was hosting [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=168.56s)]
*  a BRICS summit in Johannesburg, a long-planned. BRICS of course is a [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=172.92000000000002s)]
*  counter alliance to, you could call it to the G7, maybe even to NATO eventually, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=179.72s)]
*  that has as its founding countries Brazil, South Africa, India, China and [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=184.96s)]
*  Russia. And the South African said we can't host Vladimir Putin on our soil [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=193.44s)]
*  because we're signatories to the ICC and even though we don't agree that he [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=200.4s)]
*  should have been indicted, he was and therefore if he comes here we'll have to [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=203.4s)]
*  turn him over to The Hague. Same thing happened with, this year there's a [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=206.24s)]
*  G20 meeting in Rio de Janeiro coming up shortly and what the president of Brazil [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=214.56s)]
*  was asked would you allow Vladimir Putin, who's obviously an important part to [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=223.2s)]
*  come, he's an important partner of Brazil's as well and at first all I said [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=226.72s)]
*  yeah of course, of course he can come. We don't agree with the ICC warrant and [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=231.23999999999998s)]
*  then a lot of pressure was put on Lula and then eventually he sort of [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=235.2s)]
*  backtracked. So the ICC is considered sacrosanct. The US government praised the [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=237.56s)]
*  ICC too when it indicted Putin. The minute the ICC indicted Netanyahu and his [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=242.72s)]
*  former defense secretary, Yov Golan,t along with multiple Hamas leaders who [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=250.56s)]
*  they said are responsible for the planning of October 7th, suddenly the ICC [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=255.6s)]
*  became irrelevant. Hungary said we're going to pull out of the ICC because they [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=260.72s)]
*  let Netanyahu come and visit despite the arrest warrant but also when Netanyahu [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=266.72s)]
*  had to fly from Hungary to Washington, three different signatories of [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=270.44s)]
*  the ICC in Europe including France, Italy, and Spain gave him overflight rights even [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=276.16s)]
*  though they're ICC signatories, they say the ICC is so important, they all just [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=285.32000000000005s)]
*  make exceptions for Israel. Now it's possible that because Netanyahu's [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=290.0s)]
*  flight pattern to the US was somewhat odd, it didn't go through northern Europe [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=295.56s)]
*  and around that circular route over Canada that normally would take place. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=301.6s)]
*  There was speculation that maybe some country said you can't fly over our [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=306.56s)]
*  country but when Israel is indicted by the ICC, everything changes. The US [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=309.64000000000004s)]
*  government wants to punish the ICC, some countries are threatening to remove it, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=314.40000000000003s)]
*  France says that we don't care about the ICC anymore now that it's Netanyahu. When [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=317.5s)]
*  Netanyahu visited the White House the first time in February, there was a lot [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=323.88s)]
*  of commentary about the fact that when Netanyahu went to sit down, Trump pulled [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=329.0s)]
*  out his chair like some kind of overly accommodating waiter and stood there [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=337.0s)]
*  behind Netanyahu's chair and held his chair and then pushed it in for Netanyahu [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=341.0s)]
*  which is a very odd thing for Trump to do, usually he's very devoted to showing [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=344.96s)]
*  who's the boss, grabs the arms and hands of foreign leaders and shakes them right [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=350.76s)]
*  next to him whereas this was you know quite subservient, there you see Trump [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=354.68s)]
*  waiting and then pushing in Netanyahu's chair as he sits down kind of smiling, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=361.12s)]
*  that was the first time and then yesterday there you see Trump doing [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=365.32s)]
*  exactly the same thing, there's just not even two months later, Trump playing the [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=372.15999999999997s)]
*  role of the waiter. There's Netanyahu sitting down, Trump holds his chair, pushes [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=376.64s)]
*  it in, kind of just walks away as Netanyahu smirks, starts writing things [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=382.06s)]
*  and signing things. Now there is one other time that Trump did this which was [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=387.02s)]
*  for when the Indian Prime Minister Modi visited Washington, Trump loves Modi but [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=390.98s)]
*  you know India is the largest, most populous country on earth, the most [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=399.22s)]
*  populous country on earth, the most populous democracy on earth, a massive [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=403.1s)]
*  country. Israel is not but this is just symbolic of the American-Israel [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=408.14s)]
*  relationship. There you see the tariffs that were supposedly the cause of [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=414.97999999999996s)]
*  Netanyahu's visit and you see there in the orange highlighted that Israel, the [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=420.53999999999996s)]
*  government claims that Israel has, it's not really a 33% tariff, it's more how [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=427.65999999999997s)]
*  the government calculates what they consider trade unfairness based on the [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=433.18s)]
*  trade deficit they have with Israel and then they kind of cut in half that [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=437.58s)]
*  number to determine the new tariffs imposed on Israel and so it was a 17% [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=442.74s)]
*  tariff imposed on Israel and even though Israel withdrew its tariffs, which again [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=446.74s)]
*  I'm amazed that they add, it's such audacity, knowing that Trump was going to [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=451.5s)]
*  impose this tariff scheme, Trump's position not just with Israel but with [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=455.38s)]
*  everybody, we'll see if he holds it with Israel, is that simply eliminating tariffs [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=458.9s)]
*  is not sufficient. It doesn't alleviate the past and the trade deficit that has [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=464.1s)]
*  been accumulated and he says the trade deficit is proof that these countries [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=469.78000000000003s)]
*  aren't treating us fairly and so they need to not just get rid of their [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=474.3s)]
*  tariffs, they need to promise to invest in the US, to open factories in the US, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=478.02000000000004s)]
*  that's what Trump is demanding of all these countries. But here was a part of [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=481.66s)]
*  their, they didn't, they weren't, they were gonna have a formal press conference, they [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=488.82000000000005s)]
*  didn't but instead they had kind of a press meeting in the Oval Office and [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=492.14s)]
*  here's what Trump said when the issue of tariffs came up. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=495.02s)]
*  Where do you plan to reduce the tariffs that your government put on Israeli boots? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=499.62s)]
*  On where? On Israeli boots. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=504.21999999999997s)]
*  Well we're talking about a whole new trade, maybe not, maybe not, don't forget we [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=508.21999999999997s)]
*  help Israel a lot, you know we give Israel four billion dollars a year, that's a [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=514.42s)]
*  lot, congratulations by the way, but we give Israel billions of dollars a year, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=518.3s)]
*  billions. So you know it is true and I guess Trump was sort of offended as he [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=524.9799999999999s)]
*  should be that Israel is imposing tariffs. Now we'll see given how many [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=534.42s)]
*  people are upset about the imposition of tariffs on Israel specifically. Here for [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=538.3s)]
*  example is Ben Shapiro responding to and commenting on Trump's tariff policy and [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=545.26s)]
*  you'll never guess what he was angry about, you'll never guess, I could give [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=551.18s)]
*  you a thousand guesses, I could get, I could give you two months to try and [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=553.9s)]
*  figure it out, you'll never figure out what Ben Shapiro was specifically angry [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=557.14s)]
*  about with these tariffs. Yesterday Israel announced zero tariffs on any [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=560.9399999999999s)]
*  American goods. The Trump administration hit them with a 17% tariff anyway [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=565.06s)]
*  claiming that they had a 33% tariff rate on American goods, which clearly is not [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=569.02s)]
*  true. Why? Because it turns out that we buy more stuff from the Israelis than [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=573.02s)]
*  the Israelis buy from us. Shocker, they're a smaller country, we're a giant market, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=577.02s)]
*  not a giant shock as it turns out. So this is pretty crazy. I have friends for [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=581.86s)]
*  example who import product to the United States and then sell them. Why? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=587.14s)]
*  Because they can't get the product in the United States. So for example I have a [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=591.02s)]
*  friend who's in the jewelry business and this friend in the jewelry business. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=594.62s)]
*  You know, sometimes I actually get uncomfortable with how people like Ben Shapiro just [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=600.54s)]
*  seem to fulfill stereotypes so perfectly. Ben Shapiro, I'm sure you'll be [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=607.26s)]
*  shocked to learn, has a friend who's in the jewelry business and he imports a [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=613.98s)]
*  lot from Israel, a lot, as he's gonna explain. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=620.3399999999999s)]
*  This friend who's in the jewelry business and this friend in the jewelry business [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=626.02s)]
*  imports products that are not capable of being manufactured or found in the [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=630.3000000000001s)]
*  United States from abroad. So it's not like there's import substitution you can just [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=635.38s)]
*  buy from an American. That's not how it works. By the way, this company is [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=639.26s)]
*  an American company. The tariff that is now being applied to all of those imports [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=642.5s)]
*  is like 35-40%. Those prices will get passed directly onto the consumers if [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=646.78s)]
*  consumption goes down, if investment goes down because investors are freaked out [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=651.54s)]
*  because they're getting whipsawed like nobody's business. Again, I was talking [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=654.86s)]
*  with investors pretty much all day yesterday given what was going on and [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=659.0600000000001s)]
*  the number one thing that I was hearing from major investors is I don't know [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=661.7s)]
*  what the hell is going on. That was the number one thing before and after. The [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=665.94s)]
*  amount of confusion, chaos in the markets, a feeling of complete... So I have no [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=671.66s)]
*  doubt that Ben Shapiro spoke all day the day before with investors. I'm [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=676.82s)]
*  sure he spends a lot of his time speaking to those people. I guess the [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=682.14s)]
*  issue is US policy has been geared toward investors for so long that even [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=686.02s)]
*  if you don't love all of Trump's policy on tariffs, it's probably time to make US [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=694.22s)]
*  policy antagonistic to those people's interests and focus instead on the [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=697.54s)]
*  working class and the downward, downwardly mobile middle class. But you [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=704.74s)]
*  saw what Ben Shapiro's anger was from. Here too is another American, America [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=708.86s)]
*  first stalwart, part of the Trump movement, Bill Ackman. As you might recall, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=714.02s)]
*  Bill Ackman led a blacklist in late 2023 into 2024 wanting to get hedge fund [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=719.14s)]
*  managers and bankers and law firms together to promise not to hire any [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=727.94s)]
*  students who signed petitions against Israel. Here's what Bill Ackman said on [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=733.38s)]
*  April 2nd and obviously he's concerned about a lot of things with these tariffs. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=740.1s)]
*  He bought 1.8 billion dollars, something like that. Him and his hedge fund did in [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=744.74s)]
*  Nike which has taken a massive battering in the market since these tariffs were [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=748.42s)]
*  released because Nike produces so much in China and other cheap factories [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=753.1s)]
*  overseas where their labor is paid poorly. But here's one of the things that [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=758.14s)]
*  Bill Ackman was particularly about, wrote a tweet to Donald Trump, whose [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=762.66s)]
*  campaign he helped fund, that said the following quote, real Donald Trump should [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=769.54s)]
*  reverse the tariffs on Israel because Israel eliminated their own tariffs [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=774.2199999999999s)]
*  prior to today's tariff announcement. Trump should incentivize the behavior he [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=778.9399999999999s)]
*  wants, not punish it. Now it is amazing how much this tiny little country, how [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=782.4599999999999s)]
*  much it commands the attention of the American political class, how that's the [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=790.9000000000001s)]
*  leader that came twice to the White House in less than three months, how we give [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=794.6600000000001s)]
*  all this money to them, how we back their wars, how we are constantly talking about [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=798.0200000000001s)]
*  what we can do for Israel, punishing people who are critics of Israel in the [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=802.38s)]
*  United States. And then here you have Ben Shapiro and Bill Ackman, two very very [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=805.1400000000001s)]
*  prominent supporters of Israel looking at Trump's paraphrase saying what about [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=811.0200000000001s)]
*  Israel? Why are you tariffing Israel? [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ2QuD7xIpM&t=814.74s)]
