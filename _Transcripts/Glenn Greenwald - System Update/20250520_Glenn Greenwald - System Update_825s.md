# Israel PRETENDS To Let Food into Starving Gaza
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [May 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY)
*  Something extremely cynical and I would even say repugnant is currently going on with Israel's war on Gaza. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=0.0s)]
*  Now that's been true for quite some time, but every now and then they go an extra distance to be morally repellent in a way that you previously didn't expect that they would do. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=15.5s)]
*  That's certainly been the case for the events of yesterday. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=27.0s)]
*  The Israeli government has seen a reversal in all sorts of prior allies, people who have long supported Israel and everything they've done, who have defended the war in Gaza, who are now suddenly saying, wait a minute, this has gone way too far. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=30.5s)]
*  I don't want to be associated with this anymore. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=46.400000000000006s)]
*  And are suddenly even admitting things like, oh, I made a mistake in supporting it. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=49.0s)]
*  And you have major Western outlets and Western governments, even people inside the Trump administration, now saying that, sorry, but mass famine, deliberate starvation of two million people, half of whom are children, that's not something we're going to stand by and watch. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=52.8s)]
*  And so only for that reason that the Israeli government perceives that this rising anger over deliberate mass famine might impede what their real goal is, which is to cleanse all of Gaza, of all Palestinians, for the ones who remain, they're going to put in what they call concentrated camps, concentrated humanitarian zones, which are basically concentration camps. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=69.8s)]
*  Little tiny spaces surrounded by barbed wire and all sorts of military assets and soldiers with weapons to prevent them from leaving. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=91.8s)]
*  Those kind of dole out a little food to them. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=102.8s)]
*  And that's basically be the whole point of the life because the goal, as they're admitting, is the destroy all of Gaza so they can take it for themselves. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=104.8s)]
*  Have it be an Israeli part of Israeli land. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=111.8s)]
*  Have it be only for Jews. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=114.8s)]
*  And that has been the obvious goal from the start. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=117.8s)]
*  They barely hidden it. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=119.8s)]
*  And yet so many people have fallen for this obvious deceit that we see in so many wars where you're given a pretext that has nothing to do with the actual goal. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=121.8s)]
*  The purpose of the war is to get the hostages back. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=131.8s)]
*  The hostages families have long known Netanyahu has no interest in the hostages. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=135.8s)]
*  If you're really concerned about the hostages, why would you be indiscriminately bombing everywhere you can find where you know the hostages are kept? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=140.8s)]
*  And why would you impose mass famine and starvation on the place where the hostages are if you actually care about getting them back? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=148.8s)]
*  In fact, Donald Trump and the Trump administration showed how easy it is to get those back if you really want them back. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=156.8s)]
*  When they negotiated directly with Hamas and got out, Eden Alexander, the Israeli citizen and IDF soldier captured on October 7th in active duty in a uniform who also happens to be an American citizen. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=162.8s)]
*  And everybody knows now Netanyahu doesn't care at all about the hostages. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=173.8s)]
*  Those are the mascots, the instruments to use to justify what they're doing. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=177.8s)]
*  And I can't tell you how many times I hear every day, oh, if Hamas wants this to end, they should just give the hostages back. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=183.8s)]
*  Netanyahu and the Israeli officials, all of them, have repeatedly said that even if Hamas gave the hostages back, we wouldn't stop the war. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=189.8s)]
*  Because the purpose of the war is not the hostages back or even dismantling Hamas. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=196.8s)]
*  The purpose of the war is to take Gaza, to flatten it. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=202.8s)]
*  They're now bombing even the rubble. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=205.8s)]
*  They want it to be flattened completely, destroy every structure. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=207.8s)]
*  So there's nowhere for the Palestinians to say they just want to make sure that there's nothing but blank land that could turn them into a parking lot. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=211.8s)]
*  So the Palestinians have no choice but to try and flee and be refugees somewhere. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=218.8s)]
*  And the ones who are too stubborn to leave and stay will just be in little camps. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=222.8s)]
*  That's the Israeli plan. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=227.8s)]
*  And the Israelis now know that everyone knows that's their plan, except for some U.S. oilists who still deny it, even as Israel explicitly admits it. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=230.8s)]
*  And as a result, they're recognizing that the world's growing recognition of the true extent of their atrocities, the true extent of their criminality. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=238.8s)]
*  And always remember, the U.S. government, the U.S. worker, is paying for all of this, is arming all of this. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=248.8s)]
*  This is not some war on the other side of the world that we have nothing to do with. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=253.8s)]
*  This is an American war, every bitch as much as it is an Israeli war. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=256.8s)]
*  So they're starting to realize that they have to do something to give these other countries a pretext to pretend that there's no more famine and the famine is being addressed. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=260.8s)]
*  Because according to Netanyahu, if they don't create some symbolic effort to allow some tiny amounts of food in, the world will stop it from ultimately doing what it really wants to do. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=273.8s)]
*  Here is from earlier today, the headline is Netanyahu orders resumption of aid to Gaza. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=285.8s)]
*  And this is what it says, quote, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday night ordered the resumption of aid to the Gaza Strip, effectively ending a blockade imposed in March. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=295.8s)]
*  On the recommendation of the IDF and based on the operational need to enable the expansion of the military operation to defeat Hamas. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=309.8s)]
*  So here's what they're saying. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=316.8s)]
*  This is a quote from Netanyahu. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=318.8s)]
*  On the recommendation of the IDF and based on the operational need to enable the expansion of the military operation to defeat Hamas. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=320.8s)]
*  So they're saying we're about to announce a new policy. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=328.8s)]
*  And the reason is not because we just suddenly decided mass famine was immoral. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=330.8s)]
*  It's because we need to enable the expansion of the military operation to defeat Hamas. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=335.8s)]
*  That's what all this is about. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=341.8s)]
*  Israel will allow a basic quantity of food to be brought in for the population in order to make certain that no starvation crisis develops in the Gaza Strip. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=343.8s)]
*  Such a crisis would endanger the continuation of, quote, Operation Gideon's Chariots to defeat Hamas, he said, according to our statement from the Prime Minister's office. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=351.8s)]
*  That is the operation to go in and occupy all of Gaza, control all of Gaza. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=362.8s)]
*  Quote, Israel will act to deny Hamas's ability to take control of the distribution of humanitarian assistance in order to ensure that the assistance does not reach the Hamas terrorists, the statement added. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=366.8s)]
*  Now, when they announced they're going to allow a tiny little bit of food, and I think they allowed in seven trucks today when there's 450 trucks filled with food and medicine that have been waiting for weeks to get into Gaza, and they allowed a trickle of them, a tiny little drop in the ocean for what's needed to save people in Gaza. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=377.8s)]
*  People on Netanyahu's right, the hardcore genocidal fanatics, not that Netanyahu isn't, but the hardcore ones actually objected and complained and said, we shouldn't allow any food in. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=399.8s)]
*  And so Netanyahu had to say, don't worry, don't worry, we're not going to allow real food in, we're not going to really feed them. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=413.8s)]
*  This is all just part of the control, the plan for us to take all of Gaza. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=420.8s)]
*  Here from the Jerusalem Post, the Israeli newspaper from today, quote, Prime Minister Netanyahu, Israel will control all parts of the Gaza Strip. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=425.8s)]
*  Quote, the expansion of the operation in Gaza is for the IDF to take control of the entire territory to prevent Hamas from looting humanitarian aid. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=435.8s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday, the cabinet decision on Sunday evening to renew such aid was the correct move, he said, since without it, Israel would lose the support of, quote, its closest allies, including US senators who, quote, support Israel unconditionally. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=444.8s)]
*  The prime minister said, quote, we cannot reach a situation of famine neither professionally nor diplomatically, he said. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=462.8s)]
*  The video began and ended with the prime minister addressing other ministers and right-wing figures who criticized the entry of the humanitarian aid. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=470.8s)]
*  He said, he called the criticism natural, but said his decision revealed, quote, leadership given that it was unpopular. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=478.8s)]
*  Can you imagine what it says about Israel? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=485.8s)]
*  And then a huge portion are women and then men who have nothing to do with Hamas. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=489.8s)]
*  To sit there and watch them just starve to death is something the Israelis as a whole, as a whole country, are perfectly happy to watch and to cause, and therefore allowing even little bits and pieces of some flour into Gaza to prevent world's famine. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=500.8s)]
*  The world watching them starve to death, that's unpopular in Israel to allow some food in. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=519.8s)]
*  Nobody, by the way, is asking Israel to provide the food. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=525.8s)]
*  The food's there. It comes from international organizations, from world hunger groups, from the UN. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=529.8s)]
*  The issue isn't that Israel refuses to feed the Palestinians. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=535.8s)]
*  The issue is that Israel is blocking the entrance of humanitarian trucks that have been furnished by other international aid groups and humanitarian organizations. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=538.8s)]
*  This article goes on, quote, the video of Netanyahu came a short time after finance minister Smotrich called on the prime minister in an impromptu press conference to, quote, speak to the public and show leadership. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=548.8s)]
*  Quote, no aid will reach Hamas, period. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=563.8s)]
*  Anyone who says otherwise is sick. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=566.8s)]
*  Do you see how they're going out of their way to say, look, we don't care at all. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=568.8s)]
*  We're happy to let the Gazans starve to death. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=572.8s)]
*  Just like, wither away. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=575.8s)]
*  Watch your children. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=577.8s)]
*  It's kind of atrophy. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=579.8s)]
*  Dying of starvation is pretty much the worst way you can die, the most painful, the most sustained and enduring. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=582.8s)]
*  And so these Israeli officials are going to be out and saying, I just want the world to know we're not doing this because we care about mass famine. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=589.8s)]
*  We're not doing this because we want to be humanitarians or humans about this subhuman population. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=597.8s)]
*  We're more than happy to starve them. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=605.8s)]
*  The problem is, is that the rest of the world thinks it's bad. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=606.8s)]
*  And we do rely on them for the money and weapons that we use to eliminate the Gazans, to ethnically cleanse Gaza and drive them all out. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=610.8s)]
*  And so we at least have to pretend we're not purposely really starving all of them forever to give these governments some comfort to say, OK, we're still going to support Israel. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=622.8s)]
*  They're admitting that. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=631.8s)]
*  In fact, they're emphasizing it. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=632.8s)]
*  Hear from Heretz, the other Israeli, another Israeli daily newspaper, quote, Finance Minister Smotrich. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=635.8s)]
*  We are destroying everything that remains in Gaza and the world isn't stopping us. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=642.8s)]
*  This is what the Netanyahu government is saying. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=649.8s)]
*  We are destroying everything that remains in Gaza and the world isn't stopping us. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=651.8s)]
*  From the beginning of the war, Israel said we're going to block all food, all water, all medicine, all electricity from entering Gaza. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=657.8s)]
*  He said those are subhuman animals and we're going to treat them as such, human animals. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=666.8s)]
*  And they have done so repeatedly. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=672.8s)]
*  And then the full blockade began on March 2nd, which is more than two months ago. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=676.8s)]
*  We hear from the BBC. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=681.8s)]
*  Israel blocks entry of all humanitarian aid into Gaza. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=682.8s)]
*  That was two and a half months ago. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=685.8s)]
*  And that has not let up. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=688.8s)]
*  Right after that announcement, Oxfam International issued a statement, quote, Israel blocks aid to Gaza as Ramadan begins. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=691.8s)]
*  Oxfam reaction, quote, When our teams assess the conditions in Gaza in the wake of the January 19th announcement of a temporary ceasefire, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=700.8s)]
*  they encountered apocalyptic scenes of complete destruction and famine like conditions. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=708.8s)]
*  The international community must apply immediate pressure on Israel to ensure vital aid urgently gets into Gaza. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=715.8s)]
*  The International Court of Justice has ordered Israel to ensure aid delivers at scale throughout Gaza. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=721.8s)]
*  You've heard me talking about Field of Greens and its benefits from for some time now. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=731.8s)]
*  They've been a long term sponsor of our show, so you probably know it by heart already. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=736.8s)]
*  But what you might not have heard is that Brickhouse Nutrition's Memorial Day sale is on for a limited time. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=740.8s)]
*  You can save 25 percent off everything with my code Memorial 25. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=746.8s)]
*  That includes, of course, Field of Greens, which is the super fruit and vegetable drink that literally promises that your doctor will notice your improved health or get your money back. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=751.8s)]
*  But it also includes a lean, the weight loss supplement that targets the goals of GLP-1 injections, but without needles or prescriptions. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=759.8s)]
*  People are seeing real results and they love that it curbs the cravings. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Kb2QmYbtY&t=767.8s)]
