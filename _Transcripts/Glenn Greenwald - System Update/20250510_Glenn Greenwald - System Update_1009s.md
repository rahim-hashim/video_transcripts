# Israel's Destruction of Gaza is "Our Generation's Kristallnacht" Warns Yanis Varoufakis
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [May 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs)
*  Let me ask you about Gaza itself. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=0.0s)]
*  There's been atrocities and massacres and ethnic cleansing and genocide for thousands [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=10.28s)]
*  of years, but there's a difference with modern technology and the extent of what that can [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=17.44s)]
*  entail. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=25.6s)]
*  But we also now have the ability to watch it in real time, no matter where you are in [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=26.68s)]
*  the world. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=31.400000000000002s)]
*  You see every day what's being done to Palestinian life. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=32.4s)]
*  It's basically being eradicated. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=35.08s)]
*  No schools, no hospitals, no food, all deliberate destruction of an entire society of two million [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=37.04s)]
*  people with the intent to drive them out or just eliminate them altogether. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=44.040000000000006s)]
*  In your lifetime, and I know there have been a lot of massacres and horrible things, where [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=49.52s)]
*  do you kind of rate this in terms of magnitude and criminality as compared to other types [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=54.28s)]
*  of, I don't want to call it a war, it's not really a war on a helpless, armless population, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=61.160000000000004s)]
*  but I think it is time to call it a genocide. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=65.52s)]
*  I thought that for a long time and I don't like to bicker over that word, but where do [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=70.08s)]
*  you place it? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=72.72s)]
*  Well, there is war, which in itself is a crime. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=75.4s)]
*  And there are war crimes, which we as a species got around various roundtables after 1945 [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=81.32s)]
*  to agree that we should ban, even when sadly we start, we fight wars against one another. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=90.0s)]
*  So there is a very clear definition of what constitutes a war crime. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=97.67999999999999s)]
*  So forceful removal of populations, intentional starvation of populations. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=101.32s)]
*  Using populations in any particular way and targeting populations in order to kill combatants [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=110.32s)]
*  that may be hiding within the populations, the human shield story, these are all outlawed [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=117.55999999999999s)]
*  by international law. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=122.83999999999999s)]
*  That's what we, the greatest achievement of the Second World War, the other day we had [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=124.44s)]
*  the 80 year, actually yesterday, the 80th anniversary of the defeat of the Nazis. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=127.8s)]
*  If we got something out of that, was this basic fundamental agreement of what constitutes [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=134.07999999999998s)]
*  a war crime. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=140.07999999999998s)]
*  Now, above a war crime is a genocide, which is an attempt to eradicate in whole or in [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=141.07999999999998s)]
*  part a population and ethnicity, a religious group. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=146.6s)]
*  Now there's no doubt that if Srebrenica and Rwanda fell under the heading of genocide, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=152.0s)]
*  most certainly Gaza falls and becomes the textbook case. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=161.28s)]
*  In the next 100, 200, 500 years, it will be taught, if we still have universities teaching [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=167.48s)]
*  international law, it will be taught as a prime example of a genocide. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=172.32s)]
*  Now I have this view that the Holocaust was another kettle of fish, it was quite separate, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=177.8s)]
*  because the mind boggling necessity that the Nazis, the top Nazis felt to eradicate every [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=183.64000000000001s)]
*  Jew around the world just because they were Jews. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=192.96s)]
*  I think that remains unique in my heart as a crime. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=196.96s)]
*  I have no doubt, for instance, that if, let's say, the Palestinians decided all to drop [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=202.48000000000002s)]
*  their connection to their land and leave Palestine, then I don't think that Mossad will be chasing [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=208.76s)]
*  them in South Africa to kill them just because they were Palestinians. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=215.04000000000002s)]
*  But that is a completely theoretical and worthless point to make at this point, because at this [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=218.56s)]
*  point, Glenn, I seriously feel in my bones, morally, ethically, politically, philosophically, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=224.84s)]
*  that this is our generation's Kristallnacht. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=232.72s)]
*  If you and I were to be in a time machine and go to Berlin in 1938 and wake up on the [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=236.88s)]
*  morning after Kristallnacht, we would have only one duty, and that would be to defend [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=244.48s)]
*  the Jews from the Nazis. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=250.28s)]
*  Today, you, me, our audience, everyone, we have only one duty to stop the genocide of [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=252.28s)]
*  the Palestinians. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=257.92s)]
*  And that, I think, is essential. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=258.92s)]
*  It's a unique moral clarifier, a unique moral clarifier. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=261.44s)]
*  Today, it distinguishes in the same way that people's behavior after Kristallnacht distinguished [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=268.71999999999997s)]
*  or separated those who had an ethical leg to stand on and those who didn't. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=275.44s)]
*  Similarly, I believe that opposition to Palestinian deaths, to Palestinian massacres, to putting [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=281.24s)]
*  a whole population on death row and starving them at the same time. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=288.88s)]
*  This opposition is a constituent part of being a human being today. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=293.8s)]
*  And the tragedy is that Europe is silent, except for some of us demonstrating some impressive [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=298.52s)]
*  demonstrations which come and go. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=306.32s)]
*  We will be stigmatized by this. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=309.36s)]
*  And so will you on the other side of the pond in the United States, in Canada, in Australia, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=312.12s)]
*  for that matter. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=317.56s)]
*  Where is the global solidarity of nations coming together? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=318.96s)]
*  Where is the coalition of the willing to stop our generation's genocide from proceeding? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=322.52s)]
*  You know, I try very hard never to believe that my way of seeing the world is the only [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=328.52s)]
*  way to see the world. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=333.88s)]
*  I think it's important to keep that humility, though in this case, I don't feel any hesitation [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=334.76000000000005s)]
*  at all in, I mean, it's just as you say, you feel it in your bones, it's visceral, it's [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=339.6s)]
*  not even intellectual that this is the magnitude of this crime, of this cruelty, of this atrocity [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=343.88000000000005s)]
*  is so enormous that I don't even regard it as meaningfully debatable. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=349.12s)]
*  I'm not interested in even debating it all that much, but it is very frustrating. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=354.24s)]
*  And sometimes I feel like, you know, we talk about it too much on this show. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=358.72s)]
*  But honestly, I feel like I'm abdicating my responsibility morally if I even go a day [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=362.92s)]
*  or two without talking about it because the scale of it and our responsibility for it, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=368.76s)]
*  since our governments are the ones that are financing and arming it, are so great. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=374.52000000000004s)]
*  And yet the reality is, as you say, that most countries who are supporting it aren't really [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=378.20000000000005s)]
*  reacting in that way. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=384.08000000000004s)]
*  And in fact, in Europe, you know, it's always kind of amazed me because as much as the United [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=386.92s)]
*  States pays lip service to international law and international conventions and the [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=390.68s)]
*  like, it doesn't really never pretends to believe in it. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=394.88s)]
*  It didn't even join the International Criminal Court. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=397.44s)]
*  It's not a signatory to most of these. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=399.2s)]
*  But Europe, I mean, the identity of Europe in a lot of ways is constructed around these [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=400.92s)]
*  conventions. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=405.8s)]
*  And yet you have an ICC indictment of Putin. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=406.8s)]
*  And I remember very well, you know, South Africa was hosting a BRICS conference and [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=408.88s)]
*  they said, we of course think it's wrong that Putin has been indicted. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=412.44s)]
*  We want Putin to be here on our soil, but we're a country that signed the ICC. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=415.76s)]
*  And therefore we're duty bound to arrest him if he comes. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=419.8s)]
*  And, you know, we're not a country that gets to ignore conventions. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=422.16s)]
*  And the Europeans were applauding that. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=426.6s)]
*  You know, obviously Putin couldn't travel to Europe without being arrested as well. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=427.84000000000003s)]
*  And yet you have the European governments, at least some of them, exempting Netanyahu, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=431.08s)]
*  exempting Yoav Ghan, exempting other Israeli officials who have been charged with war crimes, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=436.24s)]
*  even from the basic requirements of the ICC. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=440.04s)]
*  And is there any kind of, I of course understand the unique history to Jewish questions and [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=444.08s)]
*  Israel because of, in Europe, because of what would happen in World War II, especially Germany. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=450.15999999999997s)]
*  But is there any sense at any point, like growing at all, like how is it that we can [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=454.03999999999996s)]
*  continue to turn our backs on this or worse, even continue to actively enable and support [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=459.03999999999996s)]
*  it? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=465.12s)]
*  Well, I couldn't put it better than you just did. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=466.12s)]
*  But you see, the point I'm trying to drive home when I speak to an audience which is [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=471.56s)]
*  not particularly concerned about Palestine, what I say to them is, OK, forget the Palestinians. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=477.12s)]
*  When you're walking down the street, whether it is in New York or in L.A. or in Paris, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=484.8s)]
*  and suddenly, who did men wearing black abduct a student from the street because she or he [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=489.76s)]
*  has been in some Palestinian protest or has written an article which is critical of the [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=501.15999999999997s)]
*  apartheid state of Israel, of genocide. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=506.4s)]
*  And you see these men effectively using the tactics, the methods of the brown shirts in [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=509.4s)]
*  1938. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=517.28s)]
*  I have no doubt that at that moment you feel very uncomfortable. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=519.4s)]
*  And what you do is you turn a blind eye, you pretend you haven't seen that scene, the abduction [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=523.72s)]
*  of this person right in front of you being bundled into a van and sent to Louisiana. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=528.72s)]
*  You know what I'm referring to. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=535.36s)]
*  Well, the moment you turn a blind eye to that, you have lost part of your own capacity to [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=537.0s)]
*  defend American democracy or European democracy or the rule of law in your country. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=546.36s)]
*  The moment you turn a blind eye to international law, you turn a blind eye to your own law. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=551.88s)]
*  So I will never forget something a Palestinian said to me once many, many years ago. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=557.5200000000001s)]
*  I'm talking about 30 years ago. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=562.72s)]
*  He said to me, do you realize that unless we have rights, your own rights are jeopardized? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=564.0400000000001s)]
*  And I think that that is the message that we need to push through. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=571.0400000000001s)]
*  We need to make people understand that this is not simply benevolence towards the Palestinians [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=575.04s)]
*  or caring about any genocide that happens anywhere in the world. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=580.64s)]
*  Yes, it is that. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=585.24s)]
*  But even if you don't have that kind of sensitivity, insensibility, if you care about your own [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=586.64s)]
*  rights, you see, tomorrow may turn against you. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=592.4399999999999s)]
*  First, they came for the Palestinians and you turn a blind eye. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=597.4399999999999s)]
*  Second, they came for the, I don't know what, the Latinos or the Catholics or the Protestants. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=600.56s)]
*  You turn a blind eye. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=606.56s)]
*  Who is going to stand up when you are being bundled into that van? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=608.16s)]
*  Let me ask you the last question. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=616.56s)]
*  We're almost out of time. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=617.76s)]
*  So let me just ask you this as the last question. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=619.76s)]
*  I've lived through enough wars to understand well how they work. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=622.9599999999999s)]
*  I mean, if you're an American citizen, it means you're living through constant wars [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=626.96s)]
*  and therefore attempts to sell the war, to justify the war. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=630.56s)]
*  And it's always amazing to me, there's this trend that's so clear in data that once you [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=634.36s)]
*  would unveil the war and you give the excuses for the war and the pretext for the war, people [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=639.36s)]
*  get very nationalistic. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=645.56s)]
*  We're tribal beings. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=646.96s)]
*  You can easily get 60, 70% of the people to support the war. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=648.36s)]
*  Then very shortly after, they start asking themselves, wait a minute, why are we in this [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=651.16s)]
*  war? [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=655.76s)]
*  It doesn't seem to have any effect on my life and we're killing huge numbers of people. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=656.16s)]
*  We're having our own citizens killed. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=659.36s)]
*  We're spending lots of money. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=660.36s)]
*  And then also it turns out that every time we're sold this case, like in Vietnam, this [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=661.9599999999999s)]
*  Gulf of Tonkin lie, and obviously in Iraq with weapons of mass destruction, and we were [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=665.76s)]
*  told in Libya it was just to protect Benghazi and not a regime change war, over and over [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=669.56s)]
*  and over, we realize, oh, we've actually been lied to. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=674.76s)]
*  And yet every time a new war is presented with these new pretext, people are, it's very [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=677.16s)]
*  effective propaganda. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=683.9599999999999s)]
*  They plant people's primal emotions and the like, and that's why it works. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=684.76s)]
*  It's a science. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=688.36s)]
*  And so of course, anyone who listens to our conversation and hears what we're saying about [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=689.16s)]
*  the destruction of Gaza will say, yeah, but it's only because of October 7th. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=693.76s)]
*  Like this attack on October 7th was so savage and brutal that whatever the Israelis do, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=698.96s)]
*  even if they wipe out all two million Palestinians, it will have been justified because of this [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=704.36s)]
*  attack. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=708.36s)]
*  Now, there's a lot of arguments, just like where people wanted to invade Iraq long before [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=708.76s)]
*  9-11 and then got to use the excuse of 9-11 to go do what they always wanted to do anyway, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=713.76s)]
*  that this is something Israelis have been wanting to do and planning to do for a long [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=717.76s)]
*  time, and that October 7th sort of became the pretext. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=721.56s)]
*  What is your view on sort of what the real Israeli intention here is and the evidence [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=725.36s)]
*  for the fact that it certainly doesn't have anything to do with the hostages, as their [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=731.36s)]
*  families have been saying for a long time in Israel, but really October 7th is more [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=734.56s)]
*  the pretext than the cause? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=740.16s)]
*  Truncating history is a very well-tried technique for justifying massacres and genocide. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=741.56s)]
*  And if you look at every colonial ruler, whether it was a British in Australia with the [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=751.56s)]
*  Frontier Wars, how did they justify the fact that they killed half of the Aborigines during [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=756.56s)]
*  the Frontier Wars when they essentially took the whole of the Australian land and declared [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=762.56s)]
*  the terra nullius and made it their own? [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=768.56s)]
*  Well, they identified one moment in time when some Aboriginals resisted and killed [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=770.56s)]
*  a white European. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=778.56s)]
*  And that becomes, this is how truncation works, that becomes the original sin, which then [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=780.56s)]
*  explains the annihilation of the Aborigines. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=789.56s)]
*  This is how they always do it. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=793.56s)]
*  This is how they did it in South Africa, the Boers. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=795.56s)]
*  This is how they did it in every massacre that there ever was. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=797.56s)]
*  The whole point is to cover up the underlying chain of cause and effect. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=802.56s)]
*  To cover up the fact that Moshe Dayan, the Israeli general and then defense minister [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=811.56s)]
*  and very significant person in Israeli history, once gave a speech right at the [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=819.56s)]
*  border, border, the fence, separating Israel proper from Gaza. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=826.56s)]
*  What had happened was, you probably know the story, there was an incursion by a Gazan who [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=833.56s)]
*  was trying to go back to his village from where he was expelled, that's why he was on [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=838.56s)]
*  the other side of the barbed wire. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=842.56s)]
*  And he killed an Israeli soldier. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=845.56s)]
*  And Moshe Dayan goes to the funeral and he gives a eulogy, he gives a speech, which is [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=848.56s)]
*  very poignant and we should never forget what he said. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=854.56s)]
*  He said, don't blame him. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=858.56s)]
*  He did what you would have done. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=860.56s)]
*  Let's not blame the Arabs, the Palestinians, because we took their homes. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=862.56s)]
*  We took their land. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=867.56s)]
*  We are squeezing vegetables and olive oil from their patch. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=869.56s)]
*  This is what they do, what we must do. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=874.56s)]
*  We must make sure that they never grow roots in Gaza and that we eradicate them before [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=877.56s)]
*  they eradicate us. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=885.56s)]
*  This wasn't, I'm not quoting verbatim, of course, but this is what he actually said. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=887.56s)]
*  So, you know, our job is to take the veil off, to end the truncated history, which always [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=892.56s)]
*  begins with an original sin of the oppressed, of the eradicated, of those who have been [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=902.56s)]
*  thrown out of their homes. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=910.56s)]
*  In order to justify their being thrown off not only their homes but also the tents in [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=913.56s)]
*  which they moved after they were thrown out of their homes. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=917.56s)]
*  Yeah, you know, it's amazing. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=922.56s)]
*  Every time people mention October 7th and I point out that the Israelis were bombing [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=923.56s)]
*  Gaza and the West Bank all throughout 2023, before October 7th, killing babies, killing [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=926.56s)]
*  children, killing civilians. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=932.56s)]
*  I have a lot of people who don't know that that was happening, let alone the prior 20 [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=934.56s)]
*  years of the blockade and before that the occupation and going back even further. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=938.56s)]
*  But even just in 2023, before October 7th, the Israelis were bombing relentlessly, [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=942.56s)]
*  multiple times. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=947.56s)]
*  They had done many, many years before, going back to 2014 being the worst one. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=948.56s)]
*  But it's so true that you just convince people that, no, everything was so peaceful and [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=953.56s)]
*  perfect and then suddenly Israel, minding its own business, not hurting anybody, doing [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=957.56s)]
*  nothing wrong, suddenly got attacked out of nowhere by these homicidal maniacs. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=961.56s)]
*  And so now you have to just let the Israelis go do whatever they want. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=966.56s)]
*  It's incredibly effective propaganda to the point where I don't know, sometimes I get [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=968.56s)]
*  very alarmed by how well-developed propaganda has become over time. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=972.56s)]
*  And I think the tactic that you just identified of truncating history is one of the crucial [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=977.56s)]
*  features of it. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD4ocVBBTs&t=981.56s)]
