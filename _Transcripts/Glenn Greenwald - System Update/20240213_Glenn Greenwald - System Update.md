# Gonzalo Lira Sr. Blames Biden for Son's "Assassination" by Ukraine
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [February 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU)
*  Mr. Lerner, first of all, condolences on the death of your son. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=0.0s)]
*  I know this is something that is very difficult to have to navigate, but I also very much [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=10.44s)]
*  appreciate your taking the time to talk to us so we can bring some more journalistic [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=15.620000000000001s)]
*  attention to what has happened here. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=19.54s)]
*  Thank you so much, Glenn. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=25.0s)]
*  It's my pleasure being with you, and my intention for this interview is that I wish the world [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=27.16s)]
*  would become aware of what happened to my son. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=38.0s)]
*  My son was assassinated. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=42.64s)]
*  Let's get into it step by step just so that people can kind of follow along because there [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=45.84s)]
*  are some people who don't know, so I want to just kind of lay the foundation for everything. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=51.2s)]
*  I have seen, as I've been talking about this case and other people have been talking about [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=56.56s)]
*  this case, some of the most rabid supporters of Ukraine who peddle this information all [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=61.480000000000004s)]
*  the time actually calling to doubt whether or not your son even died in a Ukrainian prison, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=67.44s)]
*  whether he's still in a Ukrainian prison, whether he's still alive. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=73.88s)]
*  How did you find out about the death of your son, and what is it that you learned about [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=77.06s)]
*  the circumstances of his death when you were told that this has happened? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=80.8s)]
*  Well, the process was very simple. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=86.8s)]
*  Finally, my son arrived into a hospital on January the 4th because he had double pneumonia. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=91.75999999999999s)]
*  He had pneumothorax and he had a heavy case, an acute case of edema. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=102.32s)]
*  He could not breathe. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=110.8s)]
*  He would lose conscience if he spoke for more than two minutes. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=112.64s)]
*  And this is a small note that he wrote to his sister, my daughter. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=118.24s)]
*  Now, once he arrived in that hospital, the following week he died. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=125.36s)]
*  How did we know? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=132.8s)]
*  The director of this Ukrainian hospital in the city of Kharkiv called the U.S. Embassy [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=134.72s)]
*  and informed them that my son Gonzalo had died. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=144.64000000000001s)]
*  The official from the U.S. Embassy called my daughter and told her about my son's death. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=150.16s)]
*  And this was on January the 12th. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=161.04000000000002s)]
*  And that's how I heard of my son's death in a hospital sent by the jailers [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=164.8s)]
*  that he had been for eight months incommunicado in the city of Kharkiv. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=175.76000000000002s)]
*  My son did not have an attorney other than a court appointed attorney that did not speak any English. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=182.96s)]
*  And my son's charges were that he was a pro- Russian propagandist because as a blogger reporter, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=195.92000000000002s)]
*  he had over 300 subscribers in the various websites that he had. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=209.04s)]
*  And he told them the reasons for Russia invading Ukraine. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=218.48s)]
*  He explained the why. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=226.56s)]
*  And he ventured in his analysis that Ukraine would never win a war against Russia, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=229.44s)]
*  no matter what help they received from the USA or the NATO countries. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=238.48s)]
*  Right. And just to be clear, your son was a citizen both of Chile and the United States. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=245.44s)]
*  So he was an American citizen at the time that he was expressing these views. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=252.79999999999998s)]
*  If I may give you some details. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=256.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=261.44s)]
*  Gonzalo was born in Burbank in the city of Los Angeles in 1968 while I was doing my postgraduate work in economics. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=261.94s)]
*  He was born in the USA and he was brought up in the USA up until he was 11 years old. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=272.64s)]
*  At that time, we moved to Santiago, Chile, where he finished his high school in Santiago [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=282.15999999999997s)]
*  to go back to the USA to Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=291.67999999999995s)]
*  After graduating from Dartmouth, he stayed in the USA. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=299.2s)]
*  He published a book called Counterparts published by Putnam Editorial in New York [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=305.28s)]
*  and stayed in the USA for many years. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=315.92s)]
*  He was an American citizen. There is no doubt about it. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=322.56s)]
*  While he came to Chile as a son of a Chilean, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=328.15999999999997s)]
*  at the beginning he was a wetback because his papers, his tourist papers expired. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=337.44s)]
*  He and his daughter, his sister, so we had to make all the arrangements. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=344.32s)]
*  Obviously, they gave them the Chilean nationality and that's why he had dual nationality. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=349.68s)]
*  He was born in the USA. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=356.0s)]
*  Obviously, anyone born in the United States receives automatic lifelong citizenship, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=359.76s)]
*  an American passport and all of that and the full rights of all American citizens under the Constitution. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=365.76s)]
*  Now, he was 55 years old when he died, which obviously is very young, especially to die of pneumonia. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=371.76s)]
*  Usually, a 55-year-old man in generally good health will be able to combat pneumonia [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=378.40000000000003s)]
*  if it's treated properly with just the basic minimum treatment. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=384.72s)]
*  Did your son have any serious or chronic health problems before his problems in Ukraine with the law began? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=389.28000000000003s)]
*  My son had a mild case of heart disease, the coronary arteries. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=400.08000000000004s)]
*  He never had a heart stroke, by the way. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=409.44s)]
*  When he was detained on May the 1st, Gonzalo was in totally normal health. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=412.88s)]
*  He was physically apt. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=421.44s)]
*  He had never been sick in a hospital and Gonzalo, again, let me repeat, he was in excellent health. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=423.92s)]
*  Now, he was a heavy smoker though, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=432.32s)]
*  but he had no case of any severe illness. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=435.59999999999997s)]
*  Now, when you were told by, or I'm sorry, when your daughter was told, when Gonzalo's brother, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=443.03999999999996s)]
*  your daughter, was told by the U.S. Embassy that the hospital had told them that your son had died, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=449.12s)]
*  after that, at any point, did anyone provide anything in writing to you? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=460.64s)]
*  Did you ever learn any more information from the United States consulate about the circumstances of his death? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=466.08s)]
*  No, none whatsoever. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=475.68s)]
*  As a matter of fact, if I may explain, since day one when my son was detained, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=478.15999999999997s)]
*  according to the embassy protocol around the world, an official of the embassy has to go [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=486.0s)]
*  and speak to the detained American citizen in a country overseas immediately, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=493.84s)]
*  offering him legal assistance immediately, offering them communication with the family. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=501.12s)]
*  None of those things the U.S. Embassy did, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=509.68s)]
*  because my son was detained, Glenn, due to Biden's giving the green light. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=512.24s)]
*  I am not the first one to say it in these words. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=519.76s)]
*  Someone else said it before. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=525.6s)]
*  Senile Biden gave the green light to dictator Zelensky to detain my son. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=529.2s)]
*  And let me tell you why. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=536.4s)]
*  My son was detained the first time by the SBO, which is the local Gestapo, in the year 22. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=538.88s)]
*  On April the 5th through April the 22nd, that full week, he was detained, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=547.68s)]
*  then released without any legal charge, no charges on him. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=555.92s)]
*  But of course, those savages stole all his electronic equipment, stole money from him, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=561.92s)]
*  and he came back to an apartment that had been ransacked. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=570.8s)]
*  He recovered all of his equipment and continued with the same language, criticizing bloody, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=576.24s)]
*  sinister dictator Zelensky, and he was detained. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=584.4s)]
*  He was a bloody, sinister dictator Zelensky, and the way the war was being carried out, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=588.8s)]
*  venturing on March 22nd, a week, a month after the invasion, that Ukraine would never win a war against Russia, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=596.9599999999999s)]
*  that all of the economic sanctions would backfire in the USA, and it would hurt the economies of Europe, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=606.3199999999999s)]
*  and it would hurt the economy of the USA. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=616.5600000000001s)]
*  If you see the economic numbers for Russia, they have been growing during the war. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=618.88s)]
*  Now, he continued the same language as I said before, criticizing the dictator Zelensky in Ukraine. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=626.48s)]
*  But hear me out on this one. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=637.12s)]
*  After a full year after being detained and released those seven days, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=639.6800000000001s)]
*  Gonzalo for the first time put a video criticizing senile Biden, as he referred to President Biden, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=645.12s)]
*  and stupid Kamala Harris, as he referred to the vice president, because he said, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=656.72s)]
*  I have never seen a woman so stupid as Kamala Harris. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=663.84s)]
*  He went on to criticize Biden on the 27th of April, the year 2023. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=668.0s)]
*  Four days later, Gonzalo is detained by machine gun soldiers. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=677.1999999999999s)]
*  En masse, at least 12 of them went to his apartment to break down practically the door of his apartment, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=687.4399999999999s)]
*  and they detained him. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=696.56s)]
*  Four days after he criticized for the first time, senile Biden. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=698.64s)]
*  Right, I think it's worth emphasizing there, by the way, that as an American citizen, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=705.52s)]
*  obviously he has the absolute right to criticize the president and the vice president in as harsh [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=710.24s)]
*  of terms as he wants, and there's plenty of other people saying what he said about Joe Biden and [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=717.04s)]
*  Kamala Harris, but I remember as somebody who's been covering this war, watching his reports from [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=722.8s)]
*  Ukraine, his YouTube reports and others, and was amazed at the courage that it took after he was [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=729.3599999999999s)]
*  detained at the start of the war, seeing how dissidents were being treated in Ukraine, to [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=735.1999999999999s)]
*  continue to speak out so boldly, so forcefully. Now, I'm sure I know you've seen this before, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=739.28s)]
*  but for those people who haven't, he posted a video on July 31, 2023, and it's amazing because [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=745.84s)]
*  the criticisms that you have been explaining that he voiced, which I remember at the time, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=753.9200000000001s)]
*  all basically turned out to be true, that Ukraine had no chance to win, that it would end up harming [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=758.72s)]
*  the European and American economy while bolstering the Russian economy, but here in July, the last [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=763.84s)]
*  day of July, 2023, he basically posted a video knowing that if he wasn't saved by the U.S. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=770.72s)]
*  government, if people didn't intervene to get him free and to get him out of that country, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=778.08s)]
*  he knew exactly what would happen, which was that he would end up being killed in prison. So let's [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=783.36s)]
*  just watch this video for those who haven't seen it, and I want to hear your reaction to it. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=787.6s)]
*  My case originally started as a free speech issue, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=791.52s)]
*  but because of the SBU and the inherent corruption of the SBU [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=798.56s)]
*  and the criminal justice system in Ukraine, I will definitely be sent to a prison labor camp [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=806.8s)]
*  where I will most certainly die, and so I decided that the smart thing was [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=814.4s)]
*  take my chances in terms of getting across the border. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=822.8s)]
*  I should have warned you about that. I know how hard that is to, when you're going through [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=827.84s)]
*  grief, to see a video of the person you lost. Believe me, I understand, but I think it's very [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=834.48s)]
*  important for people to have heard because I just want to make sure that nobody thinks [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=840.88s)]
*  that the American government and the Biden administration wasn't aware of his case. A lot [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=845.76s)]
*  of us were talking about it at the time. This video circulated everywhere, and so what I want [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=849.36s)]
*  to know from you is, was there any moment, obviously he's asking for help there, when his [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=854.24s)]
*  family, when you or anybody else asked the United States government to intervene in any way in order [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=859.84s)]
*  to help him, and are you aware of any efforts that the consulate made to ensure that his rights [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=867.84s)]
*  were being protected? I sent many letters to embassy officials, including Ambassador Brinton. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=872.5600000000001s)]
*  I explained to them the fact that my son was a U.S. citizen, and they had not done a thing [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=887.76s)]
*  to help him out. They didn't even provide an attorney. The defense attorney that Gonzalo had [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=895.6s)]
*  was appointed by the court, Glenn. Can you believe that? The court of Ukraine appointed the defense [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=904.8s)]
*  attorney, and hear me, who didn't speak any English? How the hell could he communicate with my son? [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=912.16s)]
*  They used a translator. I had communication with this man, Victor [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=922.72s)]
*  Serkovny, through WhatsApp with the translator in the middle, which doesn't translate exactly [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=929.92s)]
*  the intention or the meaning of the words. I couldn't speak to the man. Now, the U.S. embassy's [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=940.48s)]
*  behavior was unbelievable. I mean, they wanted Gonzalo to die, and I was always asking myself [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=948.32s)]
*  before falling asleep, was my son that important? He had 300 and some subscribers. He had hundreds [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=958.08s)]
*  of thousands of viewers. But had he become that important, that merit to detain him? [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=969.6s)]
*  I mean, it's outrageous. What have I done so far since my poor son died? I have placed in the [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=978.4s)]
*  Secretary of State Department the Freedom of Information Act. I want to know all correspondence [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=989.52s)]
*  documents between Mr. Blinken, Victoria Nuland, and the lady ambassador Brink of the USA in [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=998.3199999999999s)]
*  Ukraine that transpired between January the 1st of the year 22 concerning my son Gonzalo. I want [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=1009.52s)]
*  to know all communication exchanges between that area and the government of Ukraine or any official [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=1017.84s)]
*  of the Ukrainian government, because what they did to my son is an assassination. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=1026.4s)]
*  My son did not have any criminal charges. My son used the power of freedom of speech. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=1034.32s)]
*  I even marched in the year 1965, UC Berkeley, Mario Savio, free speech movement, the anti-war, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=1043.52s)]
*  the anti-Vietnam War. I marched in those years, Glenn. I was studying at that time in the USA. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=1055.28s)]
*  I lived many years in the USA, and I cannot condone this terrible government that the USA has [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=1063.2s)]
*  that has no place in the White House. We had never had a worse government than this one. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=1075.3600000000001s)]
*  This man, Biden, is responsible for my son's assassination because the judgment, the trial, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=1083.04s)]
*  never came. They arrested him. He had been in jail for eight months without a trial. And why? [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=1093.04s)]
*  I read in different places in Ukraine that many of the political opposition to Zelensky, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=1101.8400000000001s)]
*  they would be detained by the SBU exactly as my son was detained, and they would keep them in jail [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=1109.68s)]
*  for months because what were they doing? Their intention was to make them ill and have them die [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=1118.56s)]
*  of natural causes. That is what they did to my son, Gonzalo Lira, those criminal dictator that [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=1128.8799999999999s)]
*  that the USA is maintaining. How much money is Zelensky getting from the $115 billion that [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=1139.52s)]
*  we have accounted so far? How much has plowed into his pocket? And how much is Hunter Biden getting? [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=1149.6799999999998s)]
*  You know, I think one of the important things to note here is that obviously the United States [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=1160.1599999999999s)]
*  government has influence with most countries, probably more than any country. It has the most [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=1166.72s)]
*  influence in Ukraine given the fact that the Ukrainians are completely dependent on the [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=1172.0s)]
*  largesse of the American government to pay for their war, to prop them up. We're going to pay [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=1176.64s)]
*  for the reconstruction of Ukraine once this war is done and once we've helped destroy it. And had [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=1181.6000000000001s)]
*  the Biden administration even lifted a finger in defense of your son, he would have obviously been [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=1187.76s)]
*  released from prison without having been convicted of a crime and certainly they would not have been [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=1195.04s)]
*  allowed to cause him to die in the way that he did. Thanks for watching this clip from System [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yu4ecrFqPU&t=1199.44s)]
