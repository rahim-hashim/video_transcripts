# Why Are Dems Stuck?
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [May 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk)
*  This is from KCM71. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump's approach seems to tear it all down and rebuild it to the benefit that he sees [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  as worthy. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=15.48s)]
*  Is there an opening for the left to take advantage of the destruction of precedent in a system [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=16.88s)]
*  that seems untethered to actually back Trump's attempts at diplomacy and do so at the primary [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=21.72s)]
*  narrative of benefiting wage earners and the general population any suggested strategies? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=27.18s)]
*  This is actually a related question from Bookwench. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=36.0s)]
*  Do you consider the fact that Democratic Representative Ro Khanna has submitted legislation to codify [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=38.22s)]
*  Trump's drug pricing executive order to be an indication that Democrats are moving away [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=45.14s)]
*  from their anti-Trump focus or is this just an aberration? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=51.02s)]
*  Alright, let me answer that second question first. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=53.86s)]
*  Bernie Sanders also said, yeah, Trump, your executive order to control drug prices, to [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=55.74s)]
*  give most favorite nation status to the United States, to prevent Americans from paying more [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=62.300000000000004s)]
*  for drugs that are available for cheaper in other countries. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=66.64s)]
*  This has been something Bernie Sanders has been talking about for a long time, that Democrats [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=68.98s)]
*  and liberals have been talking about forever and yet never really did anything about it. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=72.34s)]
*  And then Trump comes and signs this executive order which no Democrat would be able to publicly [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=76.5s)]
*  oppose. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=82.66s)]
*  They oppose it because they're funded by health insurance companies and pharmaceutical companies [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=83.74s)]
*  and they may actually really be against it and work to subvert it in the bowels of the [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=87.02s)]
*  House with lobbyists, but they're never going to come publicly oppose it. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=91.22s)]
*  I think a lot of Democrats do support it and their argument has been, if you do it by executive [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=95.89999999999999s)]
*  order, you know it's going to happen. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=101.06s)]
*  You did it in the first term. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=103.14s)]
*  Big Pharma is going to sue in court. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=104.17999999999999s)]
*  They're going to say your executive order doesn't have a basis in law. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=106.5s)]
*  You don't have the right to do this about Congress. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=109.64s)]
*  Congress are going to rule that you need Congress to do it and therefore it's just [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=111.66s)]
*  going to be a symbolic gesture that changes nothing. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=114.78s)]
*  And so the Democrats are saying, look, if you really believe in this, let us in Congress [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=118.02s)]
*  work together in a bipartisan way to enact legislation that embodies the key tenets of [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=124.34s)]
*  your executive order into law so that they're no longer vulnerable to legal challenge by [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=130.66s)]
*  Big Pharma. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=134.42s)]
*  Now, I haven't seen much receptiveness to that from Trump and I think part of it is [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=135.42s)]
*  that the White House is interested in constantly creating the perception that the President [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=145.17999999999998s)]
*  can do whatever he wants and doesn't need Congress for it. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=149.82s)]
*  I think I mentioned this on a show the other night that the Bush-Shaney administration [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=154.17999999999998s)]
*  position was we can invade Iraq, we can attack Iraq, start a new war with Iraq. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=158.1s)]
*  We don't need Congress to do it. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=163.01999999999998s)]
*  And so Congress was left begging, please let us vote on this. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=165.04s)]
*  And they were trying to say, we'll vote for it but it'll be a much stronger policy if [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=168.95999999999998s)]
*  we support it. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=172.23999999999998s)]
*  And then Bush-Shaney basically said, all right, if you want to vote on it, vote on it. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=174.39999999999998s)]
*  We don't really care. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=177.12s)]
*  We're going to do it anyway but you can vote on it. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=178.12s)]
*  And it passed. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=179.12s)]
*  So executive branches, especially ones that believe in a very robust model of Article [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=180.95999999999998s)]
*  2, often want to establish the fact that they can do whatever they want without Congress. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=186.32s)]
*  In this case, if Trump really means it, if Trump is really trying to do this, you would [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=190.6s)]
*  think he would let Democrats do it. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=195.44s)]
*  But I don't think it indicates some broader willingness on the part of Democrats to work [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=198.16s)]
*  with Trump or to renounce this reflexive opposition to whatever Trump wants. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=203.51999999999998s)]
*  I just think that this issue, lowering prescription drug costs, has been so central to what Democrats [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=207.84s)]
*  have claimed they believe in for decades. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=215.16s)]
*  There's just no way on this one issue they can oppose Trump. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=217.56s)]
*  As far as the broader question is concerned, one of the things that I have seen is that [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=222.84s)]
*  the reason Democrats have so many positions that they now hold, even though they were [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=229.34s)]
*  anathema to liberal politics for decades, is simply because Trump took the opposite [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=235.24s)]
*  position. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=240.84s)]
*  So when Trump started critiquing and railing against the corruption and malice of the deep [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=242.84s)]
*  state and their nefarious interference and influence in our domestic politics, and the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=248.68s)]
*  CIA, the NSA, the FBI, long-term left-wing views, going back to the Cold War, kind of [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=254.36s)]
*  fundamental to the left-wing views to be very skeptical of and hostile toward these three-letter [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=261.64s)]
*  agencies that comprise the deep state. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=267.32000000000005s)]
*  But soon as Trump started opposing those agencies, Democrats united to support them. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=269.16s)]
*  And now you barely ever hear Democrats criticizing these agencies. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=277.32000000000005s)]
*  If a Republican criticizes these agencies, Democrats will say, how dare you? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=280.96000000000004s)]
*  These are patriotic men and women working to keep our country safe. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=284.62s)]
*  Remember the CIA and the FBI, which have long been bugaboos of civil oritarians on the left [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=287.32000000000005s)]
*  for most of the 20th century and for good reason. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=294.44s)]
*  And even when it comes to things like this Middle East trip to the Persian Gulf and improving [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=298.28s)]
*  relations with the Emiratis and the Saudis and the Qataris, Hakeem Jeffries stood up [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=306.92s)]
*  and basically condemned Trump for meeting with Qatar in Qatar and said, Qatar is the [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=311.8s)]
*  country that funds our enemies like Iran and Hamas, you know, like reading from the APEC [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=316.4s)]
*  script. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=320.56s)]
*  Who wouldn't want our country to have better diplomatic relations with countries with a [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=322.56s)]
*  lot of money and a lot of influence in their region? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=328.44s)]
*  But it's because Trump does it that Democrats then immediately oppose it, like reflexively [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=332.04s)]
*  oppose it. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=336.16s)]
*  Same thing with tariffs. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=338.0s)]
*  You know, the Democrats, or at least the left, have long hated free trade, these free trade [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=340.0s)]
*  agreements, globalist institutions. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=345.8s)]
*  The left famously protested against the World Trade Organization in 1999 in Seattle and [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=348.6s)]
*  from there that became a foundational view of left-welfare politics. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=355.2s)]
*  You know, the free trade is what has deindustrialized the working class and our cities. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=359.28000000000003s)]
*  And then Trump comes out and says, yeah, I agree, free trade has been terrible for the [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=365.28000000000003s)]
*  United States. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=368.92s)]
*  We need to get jobs back to the United States by using tariffs, which have long been a very [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=370.34000000000003s)]
*  popular policy among unions and the left. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=374.76s)]
*  And then suddenly Trump announces it, and he's crashing our stock market, as though [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=378.71999999999997s)]
*  now the most important thing for Democrats is to keep Wall Street happy. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=383.08s)]
*  And this is so, you've seen this in so many instances, this radical reversal of Democratic [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=388.92s)]
*  Party values and policies and positions, primarily for no reason other than the fact that once [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=393.71999999999997s)]
*  Trump takes a position, they automatically take the opposite. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=401.24s)]
*  And you know, I guess if you're feeding for so long on a closed discourse, a narrative [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=405.0s)]
*  that tells you that Trump is a fascist, Trump is Hitler, Trump is ending our democracy, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=412.32s)]
*  Trump is a Putin asset, a Kremlin agent, I guess if you really believe those things, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=416.40000000000003s)]
*  it kind of makes sense, like we're not going to really want to work with you, given that [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=421.8s)]
*  you're Hitler. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=424.76s)]
*  Like sometimes Hitler might have a good idea, but I'm still not going to work with Hitler. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=425.76s)]
*  There are so many opportunities for Democrats to work with that wing of the Republican Party [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=430.8s)]
*  that Trump represents in order to accomplish things they claim to want to accomplish, but [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=434.92s)]
*  the reality is the vast majority of the Democratic Party does not see opportunity and potential [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=439.92s)]
*  alliances with the Trump, MAGA, nationalistic, non-interventionist wing. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=446.44s)]
*  They have much more in common with the Republican establishment. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=452.36s)]
*  They're way more comfortable working with Mitch McConnell or like Paul Ryan or Tom Tillis [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=455.96000000000004s)]
*  or John Thune. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=465.52000000000004s)]
*  They see much more in common with those people than they see with the Republican Party. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=467.40000000000003s)]
*  It's the reason why Trump nominated some people who were against wars, who were very vocal [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=472.84000000000003s)]
*  supporters of Lena Conn and the anti-monopolist, anti-trade agenda that Democrats kind of believe [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=479.84s)]
*  in, people like Matt Gaetz, who really was opposed to so many wars, who had so many views [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=486.84s)]
*  that Democrats could have shared, Tulsi Gabbard, who was in the Congress for eight years as [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=491.84s)]
*  a Democrat, and it's notable that RFK Jr., also a lifelong Democrat, those are the people [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=496.84s)]
*  the Democrats tried to stop. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=503.84s)]
*  But the Republican establishment appointees like Mike Waltz and Marco Rubio, John Ratcliffe [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=506.84s)]
*  at CIA, they breezed through the Congress. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=513.8399999999999s)]
*  In fact, Rubio got approved unanimously in the Senate because the Democrats feel much [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=516.8399999999999s)]
*  greater comfort with and alignment with the Republican establishment wing rather than [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=523.8399999999999s)]
*  the populist wing of the Republican Party, and I think that's all part of the reason [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=530.84s)]
*  why the character of Democrats has become so hated because they're basically just this [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=535.84s)]
*  amorphous, belief-free, status quo-perpetuating wing of the establishment, and there's basically [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=540.84s)]
*  no way to make yourself more unpopular more quickly than to be that, and Democrats just [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiP3R9Dmehk&t=549.84s)]
