# Free Speech In Peril: The West Embraces Online Censorship
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [October 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk)
*  We have been reporting for almost two years now on the fact that the top priority of Western [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=0.0s)]
*  centers of power is to implement a rigorous and official and a legally endorsed regime [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=20.64s)]
*  of censorship that primarily controls the principal means that we use to communicate [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=29.04s)]
*  with one another to disseminate information and ideas to receive our news, which is the [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=34.24s)]
*  internet and particularly the large handful of the handful small handful of large platforms [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=39.92s)]
*  that have commandeered the power over the flow of information. And there's been all kinds of [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=45.92s)]
*  reporting, of course, on all the different ways that Western governments are attempting to [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=50.72s)]
*  influence and coerce censorship to demand that views that they regard as threatening be banned [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=56.559999999999995s)]
*  every new crisis, including the election of Trump and Brexit and Russiagate and the 2020 election [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=64.16s)]
*  in January six and COVID and the war in Ukraine. And now the war in Israel is seized upon every [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=73.12s)]
*  single one of them seized upon as justification for more and more censorship. That is how this [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=80.0s)]
*  censorship regime has been fortified. And one of the things that has happened without much media [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=86.96s)]
*  attention, we cover it every time it happens when we can, is that governments around the world [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=92.64s)]
*  around the democratic world are now adopting laws that empower them explicitly to wield the [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=98.88s)]
*  censorship power. It had been the case that they were doing it informally. The Twitter files, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=106.64s)]
*  of course, were about how the CIA, the FBI, Homeland Security would pick up the phone and [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=112.0s)]
*  call Facebook and Google and Twitter and say, Hey, what about this tweet? Why are you on this one up? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=118.48s)]
*  We want this one banned. There's a disinformation tweet about COVID. Here's one about Ukraine. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=124.0s)]
*  We want these gone. And a federal court recently ruled that the Biden administration's fixation on [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=128.72s)]
*  doing this violates the first amendment. In fact, one of the gravest attacks on free speech, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=135.92s)]
*  said the court ruling in decades, if not in the history of the judiciary. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=140.64s)]
*  But governments are really not content any longer to use that kind of informal threat or that kind [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=145.92s)]
*  of shaming or the leverage they have over these companies because they regulate them, because they [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=152.48s)]
*  do out benefits. Instead, they're now adopting legal frameworks that lay out the powers that [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=158.0s)]
*  they have and provide for punishments, serious punishments. In the event that major social media [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=164.4s)]
*  platforms do not comply with their censorship demands, it is now a crime or illegal not to [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=172.64000000000001s)]
*  censor in the way that Western governments want. I can't overstate how oppressive that is. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=180.08s)]
*  It's, we used to talk all the time about how China would impose all sorts of restrictions on [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=188.32s)]
*  the flow of political speech in China. That's exactly what Western governments are doing, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=196.32s)]
*  and they're doing it by law. We covered the enactment and the approval of the online safety act. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=200.64000000000001s)]
*  In the UK, look it out where welling that is, the online safety act, which is trying to make [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=210.4s)]
*  the internet safer for you by keeping away from you unsafe or dangerous ideas. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=216.08s)]
*  We have been reporting on the law that is pending in Brazil, which would be one of the most [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=225.68s)]
*  repressive of all, but it was at the last minute its enactment was prevented because Google and [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=230.0s)]
*  Facebook went to the mat to argue against it at the point of the Brazilian Supreme Court, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=235.28s)]
*  banned them from doing that further, ordered the executive of those companies to appear at [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=241.6s)]
*  the federal police for interrogation over the activism in which they were engaged to stop the [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=246.08s)]
*  law. One of the most repressive laws, and we've talked about the law in Canada as well recently, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=250.64s)]
*  which is the C-11 law that isn't quite as extreme as the UK law, and the most extreme of all is [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=256.64s)]
*  actually the one that has now been adopted by the EU, which is the Digital Services Act, an incredibly [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=263.76s)]
*  benign sounding law that in fact is incredibly repressive. And they have been building up, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=269.76s)]
*  they have been laying the foundation for months, we've been reporting on every step of the way [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=276.48s)]
*  to essentially create a perception that the failure on the part of social media companies [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=281.36s)]
*  to censor in accordance with their demands is dangerous. It's causing the flow of disinformation [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=288.4s)]
*  and hate speech, it's fortifying Russian propaganda, and as I said the war in Israel and Gaza is not [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=295.28s)]
*  even three days old. And already the EU official who oversees this new censorship law, who advocated [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=303.91999999999996s)]
*  for it, who's been a long-time censorship advocate, he's a French official who works right under the [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=312.88s)]
*  German president of the EU. He has been working overtime to create the perception publicly that [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=318.72s)]
*  Twitter and Google and Facebook's failure to censor is a serious public threat that the EU now has to do [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=328.32000000000005s)]
*  something about. And one of the tactics that censors always use when it comes time to censor is they [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=334.8s)]
*  always deliberately choose in the first instance someone who is so widely disliked that most of the [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=343.35999999999996s)]
*  public won't mind when those people are silenced. They think, oh well I don't really care if this [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=351.44s)]
*  person with this extreme view has been silenced, that person is dangerous. The problem is the reason [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=357.44s)]
*  they choose someone deeply unpopular is because they know the public will acquiesce and now the precedent [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=363.44s)]
*  has been set and then once they start using it on less disliked people or people who have a greater [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=369.12s)]
*  proximity to say the mainstream, by then it's too late you've given them that power. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=377.12s)]
*  Remember the very first people who were depersoned by Big Tech, Big Tech got together and chose to [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=381.84000000000003s)]
*  eliminate them from Big Tech platforms all at once. It was in 2018 during the Trump years of course [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=390.48s)]
*  and it was Milo Yiannopoulos and Alex Jones, two of the people most widely hated certainly by [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=396.48s)]
*  mainstream venues and everybody said well I don't really care that Alex Jones can't be heard or [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=402.72s)]
*  Milo Yiannopoulos can't be heard. They spread hatred, they spread lies and obviously it was [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=408.0s)]
*  very predictable and one of the very few people who stood up and objected at the time was Peter [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=412.72s)]
*  Teal who sat on the board of Facebook who said this is an extremely dangerous precedent. Within [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=416.8s)]
*  a very short period of time they were using it against more and more and more people including [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=422.88s)]
*  people who weren't as disliked as those two but by then the power had been given to them because [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=429.28s)]
*  people didn't object. That's always what they do and so one of the things that EU is doing even [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=436.08s)]
*  though they're after Facebook and Google equally is they're focused primarily on Twitter on what [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=440.32s)]
*  is now X because of how hated Elon Musk has become in neoliberal culture given his commitment to [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=448.08s)]
*  free speech and his refusal to censor on command and they know that going after Facebook or Google [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=456.08s)]
*  this way will be more difficult in part because they're just much bigger and more powerful [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=461.76s)]
*  companies. Twitter is a small fraction of the size of Facebook and Google but also because Elon Musk [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=466.24s)]
*  has become such a hated figure. This is the person who did more than anybody to bring electric cars [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=472.8s)]
*  to the market at a time that liberals are saying that there's no greater priority than reducing our [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=479.36s)]
*  dependence on fossil fuels. You would think he would be a hero and yet he's hated because he bought [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=486.08000000000004s)]
*  X by waving the free speech banner and promising to defy censorship orders. He's been far from [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=495.12s)]
*  perfect in that. We've covered and criticized him when he has violated his own principles but he has [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=500.88s)]
*  allowed a lot of people who were previously censored to be heard and they're enraged by it. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=505.92s)]
*  They being media elites and political elites and they know that if they focus on Elon Musk with the [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=510.32s)]
*  use of this new law there will be enough people happy about it simply because they hate Elon Musk [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=516.24s)]
*  and believe that he's allowing too much free speech that very few people object and they'll have this [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=520.8s)]
*  power to go and use it against Facebook and Google and everyone else that they want to use it for and [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=526.48s)]
*  today what they did was they know that emotions are extremely high about the war in Israel. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=531.28s)]
*  In the West it is essentially a unified consensus in the mainstream that it is the duty of the West [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=539.12s)]
*  to support Israel. The monuments in Germany and in France and in the UK and in the U.S. have all been [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=546.88s)]
*  lit in solidarity with Israel and support for Israel. The EU, the UK, the U.S. have all pledged [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=555.6s)]
*  across political parties to do everything possible to support Israel. They know that this is the [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=562.08s)]
*  issue that provokes the most emotions right now and so they wrote a letter today to Twitter to [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=566.88s)]
*  X threatening Elon Musk that you are going to pay a huge price if you don't censor more and they cited [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=572.8000000000001s)]
*  an allegation that he's allowing disinformation right now specifically about Israel. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=580.08s)]
*  Knowing that that would be designed to get people on their post censorship side. Here is the news [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=585.2s)]
*  article from Reuters about the article and what we really want to go through and show you is the [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=590.4s)]
*  letter sent by this leading EU official which we will because I don't think you will believe [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=594.8s)]
*  just how heavy-handed and authoritarian and dictatorial it is in its tone and its sentiment. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=600.32s)]
*  Fearful first is Reuters. You see the headline EU says disinformation spreading on X after Hamas [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=607.36s)]
*  attack urges Musk to tackle it. Quote the EU industry chief told Elon Musk that disinformation [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=613.6800000000001s)]
*  was spreading on his X messaging platform since Palestinian Islamist group Hamas' surprise attack [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=621.28s)]
*  on Israel urging him to take countermeasures in line with new EU content rules. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=627.28s)]
*  Now let me just stop here and say that obviously nobody likes disinformation in principle. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=634.4s)]
*  The problem is who has the power to determine what's true and what's false and I honestly [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=642.32s)]
*  can't fathom the level of drooling authoritarianism necessary to trust or want to empower [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=647.44s)]
*  government officials like Thierry Brenton the French EU official who is the leader of the [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=655.92s)]
*  government on the French EU official with the power to determine what is true and what is false [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=662.4s)]
*  to the point where they have the power to ban anything they decide is disinformation. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=668.3199999999999s)]
*  But that is what this law is it says it right there it says urging him to take countermeasures [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=673.6s)]
*  in line with new EU online content rules which means that the people who decide what is [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=684.56s)]
*  disinformation and what can and can't be heard are people like Thierry Brenton and EU officials. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=690.56s)]
*  The article goes on quote, Brenton did not give details on [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=696.9599999999999s)]
*  Brenton did not give details on the disinformation he cited. X did not immediately [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=704.3199999999999s)]
*  respond to a writer's comment for request the online content rules known as the digital services [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=719.12s)]
*  act require X and other online platforms to remove illegal content and to take measures to tackle the [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=724.16s)]
*  risk of public safety and discourse. So this is the key part is that this law it purports to require [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=732.8s)]
*  all social media platforms to remove what they regard as illegal content which includes hate [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=743.6s)]
*  speech and disinformation and to take measures to tackle the risk of public security and civic [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=749.28s)]
*  discourse all as determined by the agenda of these EU officials. This is a pure censorship regime [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=754.32s)]
*  there's no other way to describe it no drama is needed no hyperbole this is a legally enacted EU wide [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=763.36s)]
*  censorship regime that now entails massive punishments for any large social media platform [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=771.68s)]
*  that refuses to censor in accordance with the dictates and opinions and agenda of EU officials. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=777.04s)]
*  And if anyone thinks I'm overstating the case or being melodramatic about it let us look [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=786.16s)]
*  at the letter sent today by this EU official to Elon Musk because as I said it's not just the [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=791.04s)]
*  content the tone that makes so manifest what's really going on here quote dear Mr. Musk [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=798.32s)]

*  those issues where as somebody who tries very hard to see things from other people's perspectives [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=1142.8s)]
*  actually work a lot on that with my kids i mean importance of not only looking at the world [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=1152.4s)]
*  through your own perspective but trying to understand other people's perspectives if they [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=1157.92s)]
*  have a view or a conclusion different than your own instead of just condemning it or denouncing [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=1163.2s)]
*  it or rejecting it you have to first try and understand where that's coming from what the [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=1168.8s)]
*  basis is that's just empathy the ability to understand the perspective of other people [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=1173.44s)]
*  this is an issue in which try though i might i cannot understand how people would think it's [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=1180.32s)]
*  a good idea how they would want and trust government officials to have this power [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=1186.48s)]
*  except of course and you have to be cynical i guess to assume this it's because they believe [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=1194.48s)]
*  that these government officials have a perfectly aligned ideology with their own and that therefore [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=1201.12s)]
*  the censorship will only be aimed at their political enemies i still wouldn't want that [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=1206.32s)]
*  if i believe that to be the case in part because i just think it's wrong intrinsically and dangerous [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=1211.68s)]
*  intrinsically but also because i would never be secure that at some point those leaders will [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=1217.44s)]
*  change and then the views about what is disinformation and hate speech will morph and [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=1223.2s)]
*  start to be directed at my own cause or my own views [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=1229.04s)]
*  and that's what's happening with these kinds of overt censorship efforts emanating from elected [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=1235.28s)]
*  officials in washington over the internet the thing that we most use and most depend on for [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=1241.68s)]

*  these are not autonomous decisions of big tech these are pressure campaigns by the u.s government [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=2793.0400000000004s)]

*  guest he is the founder and ceo of rumble chris pavlovsky who arranged for rumble to have the [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3159.84s)]
*  exclusive online broadcasting rights for the republican debate something that wasn't at all [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3167.44s)]
*  obvious to happen and yet he managed to make it happen and we are here to talk to him about that [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3172.88s)]
*  and many other things relating to online censorship and the fight for online freedom chris it is great [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3177.6000000000004s)]
*  to see you thanks so much for taking the time to talk to us glenn thanks for having me on glad to [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3183.6800000000003s)]
*  be here with you in milwaukee wisconsin yeah first time first time for you in milwaukee i think as [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3187.84s)]
*  you said first time as well for you to be on our show if my memory serves that's right uh [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3193.52s)]
*  we're excited about many of those things so let's start off with the fact that obviously fox is [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3197.92s)]
*  hosting the debate it has the exclusive online rights for tv more and more people these days [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3203.28s)]
*  though don't consume tv who are above who are under the age of 83 they instead are consuming [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3208.4s)]
*  political content online and if you want to watch the debate online there's only one place you can [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3214.0s)]
*  do that which is rumble how is it that rumble secured the exclusive rights instead of facebook [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3219.28s)]
*  or google or any of the other more recognizable platforms from the perspective of say the corporate [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3225.04s)]
*  world and big tech yeah so fox obviously has the broadcast rights they have the rights to to do it [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3230.88s)]
*  on their their website as well um but when it comes to social media platforms and platforms we [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3236.8s)]
*  were the exclusive provider for that and we're doing it through the rnc channel on rumble [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3242.32s)]
*  and it came about i would say it's been like earlier this year it was something that we [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3249.6000000000004s)]
*  we we wanted to bid on doing the whole thing and you know taking over the one entire debate maybe [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3256.32s)]
*  getting you there to question the candidates and then we kind of got to a point where it made more [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3262.32s)]
*  sense to just go after the streaming rights and not have it on any of the other platforms and [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3268.08s)]
*  that's where we ended up and that's where we are today and now we have the first and the second [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3274.08s)]
*  debate which is like i think it's a it's a historic moment for new tech like any new technology [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3277.52s)]
*  platform to be able to have something that is this important in the united states um so it's a huge [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3283.6s)]
*  win for for rumble i think it's a huge win for new tech in general yeah i mean i see it as [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3290.16s)]
*  definitely a watershed moment for independent media for the ability to kind of liberate ourselves [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3294.96s)]
*  from the tyranny of big tech but looking at from the perspective of the republican party which is [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3301.36s)]
*  dominated by a lot of big corporate donors it's not really that obvious of a choice this is an [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3306.7200000000003s)]
*  incredibly important showcase for the republican party to get as many people as possible to watch [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3311.6800000000003s)]
*  their candidates headed in to the general election especially the first debate why is it that you [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3316.6400000000003s)]
*  think they were willing to kind of roll the dice i mean it was you know such an obviously safer choice [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3322.4s)]
*  to say we're gonna have an exclusive deal with youtube or with some massive show on youtube [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3328.56s)]
*  or facebook why do you think they were willing to take this gamble and put their exclusive rights [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3335.12s)]
*  with rumble yes so it's uh i think like when you take a look at all the candidates like uh [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3340.32s)]
*  whether it's president trump or governor de santis or even vivek like they all have profiles and [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3347.76s)]
*  and they're all on rumble and they're they're not very big advocates of big tech so like [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3354.0s)]
*  just look at the candidates perspective you don't have they're not advocating big tech at all [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3359.44s)]
*  when it comes to the constituents they're definitely not advocating big big tech so you [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3364.0800000000004s)]
*  have like this massive constituency that is on rumble and uh is promoting and wants to see it [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3368.2400000000002s)]
*  on new tech they don't want to see it on big tech so i think it was a it was a moment obviously [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3375.36s)]
*  the rnc thought about it and i think they made a really good decision in doing that they also [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3380.88s)]
*  had the same kind of feelings that the constituents and the candidates had when it comes to big tech [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3387.28s)]
*  so it's uh well what are those feelings what do you perceive as the the kind of animosity that [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3394.1600000000003s)]
*  republican constituents have to big tech well a perfect example is like congressman devin nunes [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3400.32s)]
*  right uh he was one of the first people to join rumble back in 2020 this is prior to the 2020 [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3405.6800000000003s)]
*  elections and he comes on the platform in in the late summer of 2020 and he he calls me up you know [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3411.1200000000003s)]
*  i'm a canadian guy and i'm thinking why is the house intel ranking member of the house intel [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3418.32s)]
*  committee calling me like i thought i was getting under going under some kind of investigation [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3422.96s)]
*  kind of call you want no no no ordinary yeah so i i get this call from him and he's like hey like [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3426.96s)]
*  if i bring my podcast to rumble and i search for my name am i going to be able to find it i'm like [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3433.12s)]
*  yeah of course how could you not um and he's like well that's not happening on youtube and he joins [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3437.68s)]
*  and within like two to three months he has like two to three hundred thousand subscribers on rumble [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3444.8s)]
*  whereas on youtube in four years he only had like 10 000 subscribers so that was the first like [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3448.88s)]
*  watershed moment that was like the first major moment for rumble that uh kind of opened the eyes [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3455.2s)]
*  to everybody else and then obviously dan boncino came and really sent it to a whole new level [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3460.24s)]
*  so there's that that's a perfect example of like a republican imagine you're a republican that has [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3466.0s)]
*  you know probably nearly a million constituents in your district and you can't reach your audience [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3474.24s)]
*  but you can reach it better on rumble than you could on youtube that's a problem and i think [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3478.48s)]
*  everyone sees that as a problem and these are how they come to these decisions [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3483.12s)]
*  so we're both talking about this is an important moment a watershed moment independent media [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3487.6s)]
*  the ability to liberate ourselves from the oppression of big tech ultimately though [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3492.32s)]
*  as the person who founded rumble as the person who now runs it and it's had a media [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3496.16s)]
*  meteoric rise it's now a publicly traded company on the public markets what do you see as the kind [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3501.36s)]
*  of one or two defining differences between say rumble on the one hand and google's youtube on [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3508.48s)]
*  the other we're fair we don't discriminate content you you can search and you'll have the same [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3513.28s)]
*  ability to find content that any other creator has you're not you know the deck isn't being [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3524.2400000000002s)]
*  stacked against you you're getting access to tools you're getting access to monetization tools [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3529.52s)]
*  distribution tools that you normally wouldn't get on these incumbent platforms if you're a small [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3535.44s)]
*  creator we just generally speaking we're just fair and these other platforms are not fair in [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3540.2400000000002s)]
*  how they treat their creators and how they they treat the audience they're stacking the deck [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3547.76s)]
*  they're picking and choosing there you could call it censorship you could call it preferencing call [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3552.56s)]
*  it whatever you want the the bottom line is they're just not being fair with their audiences and [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3558.16s)]
*  their creators and i think like ultimately you know we're going to prevail because we're just [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3562.88s)]
*  going to be fair so i've been around the internet for a long time in the sense that my journalistic [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3567.2000000000003s)]
*  career was founded on the internet my audience was cultivated on the internet i never went and [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3573.52s)]
*  worked for a large media corporation in order to build my journalism career and we did that much [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3579.92s)]
*  later on once my career was established and even then i always have kind of one foot in and one [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3584.56s)]
*  foot out in terms of independent media so it never surprises me to see mists being [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3588.8s)]
*  deliberately disseminated especially about new entities that are kind of threats to establishment [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3596.1600000000003s)]
*  power and obviously there's no shortage of kind of lies and deceit mythologies about rumble and i [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3601.92s)]
*  know that firsthand because before i decided to not even bring my show to rumble the one that i [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3609.84s)]
*  have now nightly but even these periodic videos that i was doing for a year or so before [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3616.08s)]
*  spent a lot of time looking into the rumble's history to understand what it was i was about [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3620.4s)]
*  to join and the history of rumble the actual history of rumble could not be any more different [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3623.92s)]
*  than the perception that people have of it so as the person who actually founded rumble not in [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3630.3199999999997s)]
*  2020 and in 2021 when large amounts of people became aware of it but back in 2013 when you [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3637.12s)]
*  were kind of in obscurity building it slowly talk a little bit about what it was that impaled you [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3642.8s)]
*  to do that and what the idea behind rumble was and and and essentially what was the idea that [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3649.6000000000004s)]
*  gave birth to this this company that has now become so big yeah and you know looking in hindsight [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3655.44s)]
*  it's it kind of all makes sense a lot more what we started to do and what we were actually [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3660.96s)]
*  looking at back in 2013 when we started but the the the whole premise of rumble was that [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3666.96s)]
*  you know google purchased youtube in 2006 and post 2006 youtube became like the de facto platform [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3674.96s)]
*  for video and sucked up basically all the oxygen in the room and everyone went there by 2010 2009 [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3683.92s)]
*  they started introducing programs with multi-channel networks there was these companies [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3692.72s)]
*  called full screen and maker that basically aggregated content and managed content on the [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3696.08s)]
*  platform and by 2013 i started to really sense that an opportunity was emerging and that [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3700.08s)]
*  opportunity was that these incumbent platforms particularly in particular youtube were starting [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3708.7999999999997s)]
*  to like prioritize corporations big brands multi-channel networks and they were [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3714.3199999999997s)]
*  deprioritizing our friends and family so rumble emerged on the premise of like simply helping [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3722.08s)]
*  you know our aunts uncles and friends monetize and distribute their video post 2013 youtube [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3727.6s)]
*  starts putting in restrictions from watch hours in order to monetize you know minimum amount of [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3734.08s)]
*  subscribers they all these different barriers in order to monetize your video which then would [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3738.9599999999996s)]
*  affect your distribution and basically they they left a small crater they left them they they built [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3744.48s)]
*  their platform on them and they decided to leave them for whatever reason they show creators what [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3751.52s)]
*  do you mean by that like your friends family on you'd upload a family video like charlie bit my [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3756.4s)]
*  finger back in like 2007 2008 like that was got a billion views the the platform was built in a [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3760.7999999999997s)]
*  large in a large degree off user generated content and then obviously they had this huge copyright [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3768.24s)]
*  issues that they've also were building their platform on but that's a whole different story [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3772.96s)]
*  but the the small crater was just totally left behind they were they were forgotten about and [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3778.32s)]
*  we saw that as an opportunity to go help the small crater give them exactly what the big craters are [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3786.48s)]
*  going to get on the monetization and distribution side and we felt that that was the opportunity [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3790.96s)]
*  we didn't think that it would go so broad that they would start censoring political candidates [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3795.6s)]
*  and taking it to like you know very large influencers because back then in 2013 maybe [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3800.0s)]
*  there was uh maybe there was a case here and there you could point you but in general there was no [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3806.56s)]
*  widespread perception no widespread grievance that rumble rather that youtube was engaged in [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3810.64s)]
*  political censorship that wasn't part of the thing you thought you were addressing was it yeah they [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3816.8s)]
*  were engaged in small crater censorship exactly in a sense like right it was more commercial than [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3821.28s)]
*  ideological yes it was very commercial for the purpose of monetizing and i believe it was probably [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3826.48s)]
*  for the purpose of generating more revenue and they felt like because we don't know what every [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3831.52s)]
*  single indicator is uploading we got to be careful what brands and advertisers to put with the videos [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3836.48s)]
*  so we'll let the corporations do that let them create networks to do that and then we'll monetize [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3841.2000000000003s)]
*  with them better and surface their content more rather than the small guy and that was essentially [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3847.52s)]
*  the opportunity that we saw and then it emerged to become something that's so much larger than [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3852.72s)]
*  just the small crater so you pretty much can't read an article now in the corporate media about [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3858.0s)]
*  rumble that no a isn't derogatory but b and that makes sense as you become a competitor of corporate [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3864.08s)]
*  media establishment platforms ones they perceive they can't control and whoever they can't control [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3872.08s)]
*  they will villainize and demonize in some way but also you can't read an article that doesn't [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3876.8s)]
*  describe rumble as some sort of right-wing site as a maga site and i you know i think you can trace [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3884.0800000000004s)]
*  it to a couple of events one is the fact that people like debba newness were the first to really [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3891.1200000000003s)]
*  start migrating as a response or a reaction to youtube's political censorship that here you have [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3895.6000000000004s)]
*  a sitting congressman routinely being suppressed in all sorts of ways he wanted to have a place [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3901.44s)]
*  where he could speak freely but also i remember when you started recruiting people like myself to [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3906.08s)]
*  do deals where there'd be periodic videos contributed i went along with people like tulsi gabbert and a [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3914.56s)]
*  couple of others there was a washington post article deliberately designed to create the perception [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3920.4s)]
*  that rumble was a right-wing site even though the people leaving were myself who was a long time [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3925.92s)]
*  left wing as someone associated with left wing causes tulsi gabbert who was a democratic congresswoman [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3931.52s)]
*  who resigned from the dnc to endorse bernie sanders it doesn't matter so when you began rumble was [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3936.64s)]
*  there some ideological component to its mission and is there an ideological component to its mission [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3943.44s)]
*  now in the sense of left versus right or democrat versus republican our politics when we started [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3950.4s)]
*  were cats and dogs you can go look back on wayback machine that's all there was on rumble [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3955.84s)]
*  that's as far as our politics went in terms of like you know really what we believed in was just [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3960.8799999999997s)]
*  treating everybody fairly and then that permeated into the 2020s and in 2021 and we just never moved [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3967.52s)]
*  the goalposts like yeah you're very right like we're constantly under attack by the media we're [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3975.12s)]
*  constantly under attack by you know everyone that's that doesn't like to hear independent voices wants [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3981.52s)]
*  to silence voices were essentially like the only platform that has really kind of fought back in [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3988.08s)]
*  the covet era really allowed people to speak out against what they believe happened in the election [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=3994.56s)]
*  you can't find places like like that and like rumble was the place where people could voice [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=4001.36s)]
*  their concerns and voice anything that they they felt that they could voice at their dinner table [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=4008.0s)]
*  like it was you know we got to a point where like the conversation me and you can have at a [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=4013.44s)]
*  dinner table is not even allowed to have happen online anymore and that's that's completely wrong [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=4018.4s)]
*  so like yeah our our ideology was you know just treating people fairly and allowing people to [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=4024.64s)]
*  have discussions and not moving those goalposts and that definitely permeated in the later years [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=4031.68s)]
*  to being like really sticking strong on the idea of allowing of following through on expression [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=4036.56s)]
*  as much as possible it definitely changed a little bit as i saw what was happening it's [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=4043.28s)]
*  imagine like i can't even imagine a congressman like a congressman couldn't reach his constituents [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=4051.92s)]
*  in an election year prior to the months before an election like that's more concerning to me as an [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=4059.52s)]
*  individual than anything else and like i feel i feel like one of the greatest achievements was [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=4066.16s)]
*  that we were allow people to to have voices when other places weren't allowing them to have it [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=4071.2s)]
*  yeah i mean for me one of the the kind of red lines that was crossed where you know for me the [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=4075.44s)]
*  concern reached a whole new level was the decision first by twitter to completely prohibit any [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=4082.08s)]
*  discussion of the reporting from the hunter biden laptop for the new york post the nation's old [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=4089.2799999999997s)]
*  newspaper in the week ending up the 2020 election it doesn't get enough attention i think but [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=4093.68s)]
*  facebook's suppression of that story was more insidious and more subtle but actually more [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=4098.72s)]
*  effective where they decided they were going to algorithmically suppress the story that was an [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=4103.5199999999995s)]
*  example where obviously conservatives felt like they were being targeted another example that for [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=4109.76s)]
*  me was kind of a rubric on crossing moment was when rand paul held a senate hearing in the united [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=4116.0s)]
*  state senate where he invited leading epidemiologists to talk about the potential [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=4123.28s)]
*  benefits of ivermectin some of the current clinical studies being conducted into it he [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=4128.4s)]
*  has has happened so many times before published uh the or broadcast the committee hearing where [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=4134.88s)]
*  those witnesses were brought before the senate to speak to the american people and youtube [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=4141.76s)]
*  namely google just pulled it off the air yeah so those that's how he ended up on rumbles yeah and [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=4148.0s)]
*  he ended up on rumble that way so those are examples where conservatives are being censored [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=4152.4s)]
*  so my question is the perception arose as a result with these people migrating to rumble well this is [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=4156.639999999999s)]
*  a refuge for conservatives for conservative dissidents who are being censored do you see it [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=4161.28s)]
*  that way or have there been examples of left-wing voices or non-conservative voices independent [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=4166.719999999999s)]
*  voices also being restricted even if they're not even political cultural voices restricted in [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=4172.48s)]
*  arbitrary ways or unfair ways who are also migrating to rumble to escape that and are they [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=4178.88s)]
*  as welcome from your perspective as conservative voices at first i don't really see it as like a [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=4183.76s)]
*  left and right just a personal perception like in a personal opinion on that i see it as like [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=4189.68s)]
*  people that are talking truth to power are being censored all the time and they they're people [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=4196.400000000001s)]
*  that affiliate with the very with the left and people that affiliate with the right anybody that [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=4203.12s)]
*  goes against certain narratives that they don't like regardless of what you know political [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=4208.4s)]
*  affiliation they may have has a high probability of being censored on the other platforms like we [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=4212.799999999999s)]
*  we have like you know perceived leftists on rumble we have perceived people on the right and like [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=4219.36s)]
*  actual leftist as well not just perceived ones yeah for sure yeah communists i think we have [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=4225.28s)]
*  actual communists on rumble there's some channels there that i've seen like when it comes to how i [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=4230.32s)]
*  look at rumble we we try to be as neutral as possible and not try to lean any particular [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=4236.64s)]
*  direction at least that's my philosophy as running the company we we don't want to put the finger on [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=4244.4800000000005s)]
*  the scale in any in any way that's exactly why we've succeeded is because we haven't [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=4250.72s)]
*  and it's very important that we don't but yeah i i we we're open to everyone i i welcome everybody [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=4256.88s)]
*  on the platform left right up down forward back like everyone's welcome on on rumble one of the [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=4266.88s)]
*  dynamics i've noticed for a long time being a free speech advocate and i am happy to be called an [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=4276.96s)]
*  activist for that cause as well not just a journalist but a lawyer is that lots of people [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=4282.88s)]
*  love to wave the banner of free speech who wants to be called the censor who wants to admit they're [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=4288.32s)]
*  a censor people love to claim that they're fighting the battle for free speech and yet [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=4292.72s)]
*  the test really comes when the rubber meets the road when there actually starts to become a price [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=4298.64s)]
*  to be paid for whether or not you're actually willing to offer free speech and there was a [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=4303.04s)]
*  recent controversy where a lot of people were critical of twitter right before the turkish [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=4308.08s)]
*  election for having complied with court orders to remove specific candidates specific dissidents [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=4314.72s)]
*  to the erdogan government and the justification of twitter was if we didn't obey the censorship [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=4321.12s)]
*  commands if we didn't take down the people we were told to take down there was a chance we would be [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=4327.76s)]
*  unavailable in turkey you had a similar case prior to that where the government of france [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=4332.8s)]
*  not a small country to put it mildly ordered you to remove rt which is the russian state-owned media [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=4340.4800000000005s)]
*  outlet and a couple of other russian state-owned media outlets as well because the eu had passed [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=4348.56s)]
*  a law a shocking law i think at the beginning of the war in ukraine that made it illegal for [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=4352.96s)]
*  platforms to provide a way for russian state need to be heard even if they're adult citizens [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuuvUL4PwWk&t=4358.88s)]
