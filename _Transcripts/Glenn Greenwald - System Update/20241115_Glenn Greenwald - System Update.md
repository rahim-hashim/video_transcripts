# Biden's Phony Israel Ultimatum TOTALLY IGNORED By Israel
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [November 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk)
*  30 days ago to this day the State Department under Secretary Blinken [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=0.0s)]
*  wrote a letter to the Israeli government that was also signed by Secretary of [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=10.26s)]
*  Defense Lloyd Austin which advised the Israelis that the US government believed [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=14.46s)]
*  that they were purposely blocking humanitarian aid especially into [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=20.0s)]
*  northern Gaza but also doing what they could to ensure that aid doesn't get to [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=23.66s)]
*  any part of Gaza including food, clean water, and medicine and the American [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=28.54s)]
*  government noted that any attempts to block humanitarian aid or to seize a [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=34.1s)]
*  part of a country or an entire country and starve it to death is a violation of [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=40.66s)]
*  international law and human rights law and that under American law a law [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=44.94s)]
*  enacted by Congress signed by the president the United States is barred [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=49.3s)]
*  legally from providing weapons to countries that use those weapons to [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=53.2s)]
*  engage in human rights abuses or violations of international law. The [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=57.78s)]
*  United States government said we're giving you 30 days to show significant [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=61.5s)]
*  improvements in all of these areas otherwise we would consider an arms [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=67.08s)]
*  embargo. Now soon as I saw that the 30 days came after the election of course I [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=72.82000000000001s)]
*  knew that nobody took this letter seriously that it was just a political [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=79.02000000000001s)]
*  stunt designed to try and deceive young voters who were disillusioned with the [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=84.5s)]
*  US support for the Israeli destruction of Gaza and Arab and Muslim voters that [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=90.1s)]
*  they needed in Michigan to try and believe like as a latch this effort that the [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=93.9s)]
*  Biden administration was willing to put limits on Israel but they did it very [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=97.42s)]
*  publicly yet again they said here are red lines if you don't meet these in 30 [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=101.7s)]
*  days we're gonna strongly consider cutting off ties there's nobody who [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=105.38s)]
*  thinks that the Israelis made any progress in any of this in fact the [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=109.34s)]
*  Israelis since then have ensured that it's all worsened there's less aid than [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=115.14s)]
*  ever getting into northern Gaza there's fewer trucks entering that are [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=119.46000000000001s)]
*  humanitarian nature the IDF is purposely blocking it they're ethnically cleansing [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=122.54s)]
*  Gaza northern Gaza by forcing everyone to leave and shooting people who don't [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=127.58000000000001s)]
*  and even American outlets which are very reluctant to criticize Israel are [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=131.7s)]
*  acknowledging that the Israelis simply did not do what the Americans demanded [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=138.7s)]
*  in this letter here from the Washington Post yesterday November 12 quote the US [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=144.57999999999998s)]
*  demanded that Israel surge aid to Gaza little changed last month the Biden [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=148.85999999999999s)]
*  administration gave Israel an unusually stark ultimatum improve aid access to [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=155.57999999999998s)]
*  hunger ravage Gaza and the next 30 days or risk losing some American military [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=159.62s)]
*  support with the deadline set to expire Tuesday humanitarian organizations say [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=164.06s)]

*  civilians as quote beyond imagination with the deadline here authorities in [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=187.78s)]
*  Israel have touted their progress another crossing of the Gaza has been [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=192.5s)]
*  open a polio vaccination campaign has been completed the number of trucks [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=195.7s)]
*  entering Gaza is up from last month's record low a few have reached hospitals [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=199.7s)]
*  in Gaza's northernmost cities which Israel has sealed off from nearly all [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=203.9s)]
*  outside assistance for more than a month but a post analysis a Washington Post [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=208.22s)]
*  analysis based on interviews with more than a dozen humanitarian workers and [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=213.54s)]
*  officials found that Israel has largely failed to comply with the three main [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=216.82s)]
*  demands of the US letter surging humanitarian aid across the enclave [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=220.74s)]
*  resuming access for commercial trucks and ending the isolation of the north so [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=224.46s)]
*  these really simply didn't do it they didn't pretend to do it even a week ago [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=231.10000000000002s)]
*  before the election the State Department admitted that there was no sign they [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=235.86s)]
*  were moving there but they said oh we're gonna wait 30 days we've gone over this [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=239.18s)]
*  letter before here it is it was written on October 31st it was written to the [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=242.46s)]
*  then Minister of Defense that Netanyahu has now fired the of Golan and Rod [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=248.1s)]
*  Dramer the Minister of Strategic Affairs signed by Anthony Blinken and Lloyd [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=252.62s)]
*  Austin and we went over the various demands that this letter included [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=256.1s)]
*  including all these different attempts to try to demand further humanitarian [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=260.74s)]
*  aid surged into all parts of Gaza but especially into northern Gaza now a [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=266.34s)]
*  group of aid organizations including the one run by John McCain's widow Cindy [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=272.7s)]
*  McCain Oxfam who's been warning forever that Gaza is on the brink of famine that [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=281.14s)]
*  many many children and other people have died of hunger already they united and [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=287.26s)]
*  said here's all the data proving that none of this was improved and so [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=293.18s)]
*  yesterday the AP's Matt Lee went to the State Department in order to badger the [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=298.18s)]
*  State Department spokesman about what everybody knows that they're lying [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=303.7s)]
*  about which is that they sent this letter as a stunt for the election never [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=308.09999999999997s)]
*  meant it and now they have to stand up and lie and say that Israel is delivering [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=313.78s)]
*  humanitarian aid to Gaza even though everyone in the world knows they're not [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=317.97999999999996s)]
*  here's how that went. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=320.7s)]
*  You've heard me say and as you've heard Matt and the Secretary say previously if [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=324.18s)]
*  we don't see steps being taken we of course will appropriately enforce US law [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=329.38s)]
*  but correct me if I'm wrong isn't that what you guys said a month ago? That is what we [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=335.46000000000004s)]
*  said a month ago and that is why we laid out and they have not yet met them [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=340.98s)]
*  because you say that they have made some taken some steps but more needs to be [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=344.66s)]
*  made in other words they have not that letter by the deadline then you are [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=348.06s)]
*  giving them a pass is that I don't understand there's no other way to look [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=353.74s)]
*  at it no I don't think that is true that letter was specific about some specific [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=357.22s)]
*  areas where we wanted to see them take some additional steps. Have you seen those steps? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=362.04s)]
*  We have seen some of those steps being taken yes yes they didn't say some [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=365.9s)]
*  it's at all right Matt the point is more than any singular step we outlined a [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=370.38s)]
*  number of steps that we wanted to see taken what matters most is not just a [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=376.6s)]
*  specific action or a specific item but the totality of progress that we see. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=381.64000000000004s)]
*  I'll let others have a crack at that. The point is Matt that we want to see the [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=387.16s)]
*  totality of the humanitarian situation improve and we think some of these steps [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=391.8s)]
*  will allow the conditions for that to continue to progress. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=395.40000000000003s)]
*  I mean people like this who are employed with the State Department have been [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=399.8s)]
*  standing up every day and defending everything the Israelis have been doing [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=403.88s)]
*  in the destruction of Gaza and to me these people deserve Nuremberg trials. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=407.92s)]
*  I don't understand what could possibly be worth it in the world to stand up [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=411.2s)]
*  every day and lie for the Israelis and be humiliated by the Israelis in front [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=416.96s)]
*  of the entire world and then have to go and stand there and have everybody know [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=422.04s)]
*  that all these demands that you made of Israel were not complied with. Now the [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=425.52s)]
*  reality is the US is not really demanding anything. Everybody knows [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=429.04s)]
*  including the Americans that the Israelis aren't going to do it. The [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=432.6s)]
*  Americans don't care at all but the entire theater is so sickening given [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=434.48s)]
*  that what they're doing is denying and justifying and covering up for what is [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=438.88s)]
*  clearly the most horrific war against humanity and the most atrocious [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=444.4s)]
*  immorality of any war this century at least. Here on CNN and again this is [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=452.64s)]
*  starting to break into the mainstream given how transparent it is. Here's CNN [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=458.44s)]
*  yesterday reporting on all this. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=463.12s)]
*  Israeli President Herzog at a critical point and another critical point in the [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=464.52s)]
*  war against Hamas and Gaza. Today is the deadline that the Biden administration [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=471.6s)]
*  had set for the Israeli government to significantly increase the amount of aid [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=475.48s)]
*  reaching Gaza. In a joint statement, eight humanitarian aid organizations say [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=480.15999999999997s)]
*  that the Israeli government has not only failed to do that but also quote to [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=485.44s)]
*  take actions that dramatically worsened that took actions that dramatically [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=490.08s)]
*  worsened the situation on the ground. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=494.84s)]
*  Think about that has to be that for CNN to say that not only did the Israelis [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=497.52s)]
*  ignore the letter and refuse to even make progress toward any of the demands [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=501.48s)]
*  they went in the opposite direction and they ensure that those humanitarian [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=505.56s)]
*  crises worsened which is exactly what has happened. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=509.24s)]
*  This is Kylie Atwood is live in Washington with the very latest and Kylie if today is [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=512.68s)]
*  the deadline what happens now? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=517.28s)]
*  It's a great question Kate and it's one that we are waiting to hear from from the [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=519.3199999999999s)]
*  Biden administration. As you said this is an assessment that eight humanitarian [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=524.0s)]
*  aid organizations did because this letter was a public letter was from the [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=528.8s)]
*  Secretary of State the Secretary of Defense to their Israeli counterparts [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=532.6s)]
*  making these demands more than a dozen very clear demands about what Israel had [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=536.3199999999999s)]
*  to do in terms of taking steps to allow more excuse me humanitarian [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=541.6s)]
*  support into Gaza. Now what these aid organizations are saying is that based [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=547.5600000000001s)]
*  on what the United States laid out their assessment is effectively that Israel [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=552.44s)]
*  failed this test that they did not live up to the demands that the US was making [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=557.08s)]
*  on all of the demands that the US made they said that they failed to meet the [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=561.64s)]
*  criteria and on none of them did they see full or significant progress from [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=566.28s)]
*  Israel as you said across the board these aid organizations felt that Israel [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=571.28s)]
*  actually made the humanitarian situation in northern Gaza over the last month [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=575.48s)]
*  worse. And here's the letter that the aid organizations wrote there you see the [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=580.6s)]
*  names of them and essentially just goes through each of the different [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=587.52s)]
*  demands that the United States made and for example here's just a kind of [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=594.6800000000001s)]
*  representative chart where they list all the demands of the United States [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=597.8s)]
*  government with the US government called requirements and then there's the grade [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=601.24s)]
*  the record the note at the end which is either red that they haven't done it at [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=604.2s)]
*  all yellow that they've done it a little bit but still more is needed and green [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=608.68s)]
*  to show that they've complied you see that there are no greens they're almost [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=611.4s)]
*  all red because the United States demands were never intended to be demands they [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=615.12s)]
*  were intended to be an election ploy designed to fool voters into thinking [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=619.72s)]
*  that they cared in the slightest about the wars of the war crimes and wars [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=624.36s)]
*  against humanity that they've been enabling with the Israelis in Gaza here [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=630.2800000000001s)]
*  just I want to take you just have you take a look at this which is a the [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=633.6800000000001s)]
*  testimony of Nizam Mahmoud who is a doctor who has spent time recently in [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=638.8000000000001s)]
*  Gaza and I just want you to take a listen to what it is that he's describing [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=645.1600000000001s)]
*  under oath before the British Parliament [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=649.2s)]
*  man maybe five years older than me and he said he was while he was working he [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=679.2s)]
*  was just saying yeah when they came in February they got all of us who were [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=685.96s)]
*  still here they put our hands behind our backs tied them up put a hood over our [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=692.08s)]
*  heads made us stand for ten hours beat us cursed us in Arabic humiliated [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=697.6800000000001s)]
*  us and then some were taken away some were killed some were detained some [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=705.44s)]
*  were released we had a medical student he worked with us who described how the [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=710.9200000000001s)]
*  women had all been lined up and been told to strip down to their underwear [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=717.36s)]
*  and made to stand for hours like that which is deeply deeply humiliating [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=721.6800000000001s)]
*  particularly in that culture and then when they told us she could go they [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=728.12s)]
*  wouldn't give her a clothes back so she had to run through the streets like that [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=733.0s)]
*  which for her was extremely traumatic so there's a consistent theme of attack [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=736.08s)]
*  humiliation aggression against people who are simply trying to do their job to try [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=744.16s)]
*  and help people last night we interviewed the American journalist [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=752.4s)]
*  Jeffrey LaFrede who described his own Jeremy LaFrede who described his own [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=755.62s)]
*  humiliation that he endured at the hands of the Israelis and obviously [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=761.36s)]
*  given that he was an American journalist they were much more limited [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=765.6s)]
*  in what they could do and yet they were completely sadistic and the kinds of [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=767.92s)]
*  things to which they subjected him that was the interview that we put on locals [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=771.48s)]
*  for now we're gonna try and put it on this show soon as we have some time now [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=775.76s)]
*  I just want to show you and there's been some really horrific horrific videos of [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=780.48s)]
*  that same person actually who testified that British doctor about how common it [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=789.8399999999999s)]
*  was for children who were blown up as part of Israeli bombs to be alive and [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=796.0799999999999s)]
*  be on the ground and then a drone would come and shoot them on purpose or [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=802.4399999999999s)]
*  snipers would shoot them there's been a lot of evidence about that as well here [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=805.88s)]
*  is a Gazan journalist who lives in Gaza whose name is Abu Baker Abed and he's [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=809.76s)]
*  been writing articles for the news site DropSite about what he's been [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=816.48s)]
*  experiencing he was on breaking points with Ryan Grim who's from DropSite and [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=822.76s)]
*  described what it is that he's been experiencing in northern Gaza just I'm [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=829.2s)]
*  curious on a on a personal level if you don't mind mind me ask it's mid-afternoon [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=835.72s)]
*  there now in Gaza what what have you eaten so far today and like what is what [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=839.16s)]
*  is your hope for what you might have before the day is over you can see how [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=845.56s)]
*  the electricity was cut off this is one of the main things that is happening [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=852.8s)]
*  right now because so it's very expected that I'm talking to you are spinning the [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=857.52s)]
*  light and I'm hoping and I'm like a human being I'm human being I'm supposed [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=862.24s)]
*  to be a human being and I'm just like wishing hoping for a day instead of you [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=867.4s)]
*  like for a moment like give me like a moment of your life of your worst day to [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=872.36s)]
*  me so that I can feel at least that I'm a human but we're feeling so far is that [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=876.64s)]
*  again it's just like some loaves of bread you have suppose if you have it [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=881.0s)]
*  even and they are made by you know they are made by bug infested flour of course [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=885.84s)]
*  because there is no flour that has been allowed to enter the strip but at the [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=891.32s)]
*  same time we have like as I wrote in this piece we have some like Saturday [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=896.5600000000001s)]
*  local plate and with some olive oil so that's what we eat every single day it's [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=902.04s)]
*  just one time so we are making a process here we're making a schedule clear you [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=908.1999999999999s)]
*  know like we may not we minimize things so ever everyone has a pop I mean they [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=913.24s)]
*  just don't have food and the reason they don't have food is because at the [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=919.48s)]
*  beginning of the war the Israeli said we're not gonna allow food water [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=921.88s)]
*  medicine or electricity into the Gaza Strip and that's exactly what they [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=924.52s)]
*  starving populations because they want them to force them out so that they can [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=930.0s)]
*  destroy it and rebuild and have the Israelis take it over and those people [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=933.76s)]
*  know that if they leave they will never be able to go back to their homes again [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=936.7199999999999s)]
*  they'll be refugees for the rest of their lives and you could you know just [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=940.12s)]
*  pre-eat every day you can watch every day people in Gaza aid groups describing [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=946.1999999999999s)]
*  that they've never seen anything like that Western doctors and nurses who go [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=952.56s)]
*  there come back and are completely traumatized by the things they're seeing [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=955.8s)]
*  and of course it's not like any other war even in Lebanon which the Israelis [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=959.56s)]
*  are now trying to repeat what they're doing in Gaza and in Beirut at least [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=963.64s)]
*  people can flee in Gaza there's no fleeing it's an extremely densely packed [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=966.52s)]
*  strip of land and it's one of the most densely packed places in the world those [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=971.64s)]
*  people are locked in even Lebanese can the Lebanese are fleeing into Syria and [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=977.3199999999999s)]

*  intimidate him by suggesting he was arrested for terrorism they put him in [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9c5dkCUBk&t=1022.92s)]
