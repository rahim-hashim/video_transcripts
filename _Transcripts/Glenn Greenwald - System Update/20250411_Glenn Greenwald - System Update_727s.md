# What Dave Rubin's Netanyahu Meeting Reveals About Independent Media
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [April 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg)
*  All right, next question from Tucker the dog. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=0.0s)]
*  I don't know what that means, but I'm always happy to take questions from canines. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=9.48s)]
*  In regards to the independent media environment, I am interested in your opinion of Tim Poole [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=18.76s)]
*  and Dave Rubin, and I think a few others having a secretive meeting with Netanyahu. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=22.56s)]
*  Do you think this is concerning for independent media? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=29.34s)]
*  Do you have any ethical concerns or is it a normal practice for journalists to meet [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=31.74s)]
*  with foreign leaders in this way to get out information? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=35.86s)]
*  It is not unheard of for journalists to have off-the-record meetings with American political [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=42.3s)]
*  leaders and even foreign leaders. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=50.18s)]
*  Obviously, why would a foreign leader want to meet in secret with a journalist or why [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=52.3s)]
*  would a foreign leader want to meet in secret with influencers? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=57.06s)]
*  Because they want to impart to them propaganda about why they should be more aligned with [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=63.14s)]
*  that country's agenda or that leader's way of thinking. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=69.76s)]
*  Now, the people they met with are already very pro-Israel. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=74.1s)]
*  There's a picture that Dave Rubin posted of himself and Netanyahu. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=80.46s)]
*  It almost looks like he's in the middle of some sort of sexual ecstasy. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=88.78s)]
*  That's like a sustained one. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=93.86s)]
*  He's standing next to Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=95.33999999999999s)]
*  Basically, he's his leader, Dave Rubin. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=96.94s)]
*  Few people love worship and are more loyal to Israel than Dave Rubin. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=99.5s)]
*  He's got to stand next to Netanyahu. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=102.97999999999999s)]
*  I don't know what possible impact that could have. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=105.46s)]
*  Dave Rubin was already somebody who puts Israel at the center of his world. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=109.05999999999999s)]
*  I don't know how he could do that even more. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=114.46s)]
*  Maybe he'll be more excited, kind of like preaching to the choir, get the choir more [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=117.61999999999999s)]
*  excited even though they were already on your side. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=121.46s)]
*  Tim Poole, I don't want to make sweeping statements about his views on Israel. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=125.02s)]
*  I know he's very pro-Israel, but I don't know that there's nuance there. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=129.38s)]
*  I've seen a little bit maybe. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=132.9s)]
*  I just don't know enough to make definitive statements. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=134.5s)]
*  It's not that it's that unheard of. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=139.62s)]
*  My understanding is Dave Rubin posted a picture of it. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=141.5s)]
*  I think Tim Poole talked about it. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=144.86s)]
*  I think that happened after it was disclosed, but they met under a set of [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=146.22s)]
*  rules that journalists use where you can't report on anyone who is at the meeting. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=151.26s)]
*  You can't report on anything that was discussed, but you can disclose the fact [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=157.3s)]
*  at the meeting and just maybe like general impressions. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=161.42s)]
*  So it was rules of secrecy basically. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=164.82s)]
*  They weren't allowed to quote Netanyahu. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=168.42s)]
*  They weren't allowed to talk about what he said. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=169.73999999999998s)]
*  And I do think this points to a problem in independent media. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=173.77999999999997s)]
*  I think one of the problems that we were just talking about with corporate media is [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=176.14s)]
*  that they became too partisan, too ideological, too willing to act [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=178.73999999999998s)]
*  subserviently to a particular faction, the US security state, the Democratic party, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=183.89999999999998s)]
*  whatever. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=187.45999999999998s)]
*  And I think there's definitely that same problem in independent media. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=187.98s)]
*  I've talked before about how the easiest way to have success, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=193.78s)]
*  financial success, rating success, in this new independent media environment [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=198.73999999999998s)]
*  is to plant your flag in one faction and say, this is who I am, this is where I am, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=204.89999999999998s)]
*  this is who I defend, this is the ideology I believe in, I'm never gonna deviate from it. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=209.85999999999999s)]
*  You attract all the people who believe in that ideology or who are loyal to that party [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=214.14s)]
*  or to that faction and they wanna hear their views validated all the time. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=218.9s)]
*  And you can build a very big audience of people who just wanna kind of keep [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=222.98s)]
*  informational closure and always have their views validated and never challenged, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=227.26s)]
*  let alone rejected. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=231.01999999999998s)]
*  And a lot of people are making a lot of money in independent media doing that. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=232.78s)]
*  And I absolutely believe that the emergence of independent media is a net good [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=238.94s)]
*  just for the reason that it increases the amount of alternatives people have. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=246.06s)]
*  And there are people who have tried independent media who have not succumbed [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=252.94s)]
*  to that kind of group ban, gradians, capture Joe Rogan probably being the best example. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=256.98s)]
*  Joe Rogan does not sit there and just praise the Democratic, the Republican party. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=264.06s)]
*  He's always had kind of a mixture of views. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=270.1s)]
*  He has guests on who have a very wide ranging set of ideas. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=273.06s)]
*  And he obviously became the most popular program in the country now. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=279.5s)]
*  It's a little different because Joe Rogan's program is not primarily political. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=285.54s)]
*  Sometimes it's political. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=289.82s)]
*  Sometimes it's political. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=291.06s)]
*  It's cultural. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=293.58s)]
*  He considers himself a comedian. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=295.1s)]
*  He has a lot of comedians on, actors, celebrities, and [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=296.82s)]
*  a lot of apolitical content just kind of along the way there's political content. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=299.78000000000003s)]
*  But I'm talking about political shows. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=304.9s)]
*  It's difficult to be successful as a political show unless you do that. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=306.14s)]
*  And once you do that, in a lot of ways, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=311.58s)]
*  you become no different than the corporate media. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=314.3s)]
*  Now they have a lot of proximity to power. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=317.74s)]
*  If you're suddenly now, because you cheered on MAGA, you cheered on Trump every day, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=320.34000000000003s)]
*  now you're getting invited to the White House, you're being let in on secret meetings. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=325.42s)]
*  The Trump White House is calling you, giving you little tidbits. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=329.14s)]
*  To what extent is that really independent media? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=333.18s)]
*  I mean, I've always believed it's important to keep people in power [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=335.7s)]
*  at a distance, at arm's length. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=341.78000000000003s)]
*  The minute you start befriending them, the minute you start talking to them too much, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=344.82s)]
*  the minute you start succumbing to the temptations of being let into their world, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=349.22s)]
*  people with power, they can open doors. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=355.1s)]
*  I go, I get to go to the White House, I get to have a meeting with a foreign leader, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=357.3s)]
*  not just a foreign leader, but the Prime Minister of Israel. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=360.5s)]
*  Of course that's going to compromise your independence. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=365.1s)]
*  Or maybe not, of course, maybe you can resist that and fight against that. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=368.62s)]
*  But it's certainly going to have a big effect. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=373.14s)]
*  That's why I've always hated anything that reeks of journalists and [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=374.46000000000004s)]
*  political power merging socially or in any other way. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=379.26s)]
*  Like that White House Correspondents' Dinner, I absolutely despise it. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=383.5s)]
*  It makes me sick to my stomach. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=387.78000000000003s)]
*  Where they all dress up as if they're at the Oscars and they get to meet [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=390.62s)]
*  like B-list celebrities and like chatter at the White House with the President. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=393.66s)]
*  It's just so corrupting. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=400.02s)]
*  It creates this like this culture of Versailles. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=401.02s)]
*  You know, like you're either in the royal court or you're not. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=403.86s)]
*  And a lot of these people have not been in the royal court. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=406.14s)]
*  They have been outsiders. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=408.06s)]
*  And now suddenly their party, their faction, their candidate is in power. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=409.21999999999997s)]
*  And so are they. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=412.06s)]
*  And you think having sat there and met with Netanyahu, getting invited to these [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=414.5s)]
*  events, if they're going to go and criticize Trump, even when he warrants it, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=420.97999999999996s)]
*  or criticize Netanyahu, who they just sat in a small group with, who knows very [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=425.65999999999997s)]
*  well how to manipulate Americans as he posted up before. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=430.53999999999996s)]
*  And on some level, the issue of audience capture can actually be more problematic [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=433.02s)]
*  in independent media. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=438.74s)]
*  It didn't used to be such a problem in corporate media years ago, in the decades [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=441.58s)]
*  I was describing earlier, because when there was only ABC, NBC, and CBS, they [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=447.09999999999997s)]
*  were the only games in town. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=452.46s)]
*  The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, your local [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=453.7s)]
*  newspaper. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=457.09999999999997s)]
*  But it was a problem. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=458.94s)]
*  Everybody felt more or less trusting of in terms of getting the news from, because [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=460.42s)]
*  they were not overtly partisan. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=467.26s)]
*  Like I said, they had other biases, but it wasn't so overtly partisan. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=469.42s)]
*  Now there is absolutely audience capture among corporate media. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=474.46s)]
*  The vast majority of the New York Times subscribers, vast, vast majority are [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=477.38s)]
*  liberals. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=481.46s)]
*  They hate Trump. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=482.46s)]
*  Same with The Washington Post. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=483.97999999999996s)]
*  They had mass cancellations of subscriptions when Jeff Bezos barred them [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=484.97999999999996s)]
*  from endorsing Kamala Harris. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=489.82s)]
*  Obviously, the cable outlets all have their audiences. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=494.78s)]
*  And you actually saw that with Fox, which I personally do believe is the most [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=498.26s)]
*  independent of the three cable networks, for reasons I can explain, but not really [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=502.58s)]
*  relevant now. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=506.82s)]
*  But you have to see that with Fox, which I personally do believe is the most [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=507.82s)]
*  independent of the three cable networks, for reasons I can explain, but not really [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=509.97999999999996s)]
*  when Trump was telling everybody the 2020 election was the byproduct of fraud, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=514.3s)]
*  that Biden's victory was fraudulent, byproduct of voter fraud. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=520.98s)]
*  Many, maybe even most people on Fox were not on board with that. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=525.5s)]
*  And some of them actually were opposed to it. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=533.42s)]
*  Tucker Carlson went on the air and ranted and raved about the dishonesty of Sidney [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=535.02s)]
*  Powell, how she keeps making these grandiose claims that she has all this [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=538.94s)]
*  proof. But then every time he invites her on to show it, she won't come on. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=542.98s)]
*  She never shows this proof. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=545.58s)]
*  And a lot of Fox viewers started getting very angry because they were loyal to [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=548.3800000000001s)]
*  Trump. And Trump was saying, this is what happened. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=551.7800000000001s)]
*  And Fox wasn't saying that. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=554.1400000000001s)]
*  But Newsmax was. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=555.2600000000001s)]
*  Newsmax was totally on board. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=557.6600000000001s)]
*  And you saw this migration of a good number of people, a good number of [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=560.1s)]
*  conservatives away from Fox to Newsmax. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=562.5400000000001s)]
*  And as a result, Fox started getting more receptive to the fraud narrative. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=566.26s)]
*  That is a kind of audience capture that I think is new for corporate media, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=570.9399999999999s)]
*  because they are now all in silos. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=574.26s)]
*  You know who the audience is of each one of these outlets. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=576.22s)]
*  But I think with independent media, because shows and independent journalists [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=580.3s)]
*  rely on their viewers, not just for ratings, not just to show up, but also [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=586.14s)]
*  for financial support. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=590.9s)]
*  Most independent media shows, most independent journalists can't make a [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=593.54s)]
*  living unless they have their readers and viewers supporting them financially. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=597.34s)]
*  You know, monthly subscriptions or donations or whatever. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=605.66s)]
*  That's what independent media does rely on mostly. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=608.18s)]
*  Then many of them become afraid to say anything that might alienate them. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=611.54s)]
*  I mean, I've been through this many times in my career, where you take a position [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=617.66s)]
*  that you know is going to alienate a lot of your audience, and you can watch them [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=622.62s)]
*  go away, the subscriptions drop and fall. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=625.5799999999999s)]
*  But I would way rather have fewer viewers and make less money and know that I'm [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=631.06s)]
*  not in prison to say things I don't really believe to keep my audience happy. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=639.66s)]
*  I've never had a viewership or a readership that expected me to do that [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=644.14s)]
*  or wanted me to do that. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=648.3s)]
*  And I think it's really commendable for people who consume news to stay with [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=650.58s)]
*  somebody, even when they're saying things that are so against your views, as long [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=656.86s)]
*  as you think they're doing their best to be honest, you can be challenged by it. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=661.6999999999999s)]
*  I think it's boring to listen to somebody who agrees with me all the time. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=665.22s)]
*  I really do. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=667.58s)]
*  I don't like it. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=669.18s)]
*  I don't find it compelling or engaging. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=670.42s)]
*  There's too much agreement. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=675.54s)]
*  It's like we're already on the same wavelength. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=676.54s)]
*  So I do think independent media is an absolute positive. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=680.38s)]
*  I've been a big defender of it. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=683.38s)]
*  I still am. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=684.62s)]
*  I think free speech on the internet is the most important thing, but I also think [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=685.42s)]
*  there are some important vulnerabilities independent media has, some of which are [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=688.5s)]
*  shared by corporate media and some of which are more inherent to independent [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=691.98s)]
*  media that I think are worth being aware of. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpC8n10ESyg&t=696.58s)]
