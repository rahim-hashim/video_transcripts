# Dems' Bizarre & Invasive Fixation On Hegseth's Personal Life
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [January 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU)
*  I found the testimony both of Pete Hegseth and Marco Rubio, Pete Hegseth yesterday and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=0.0s)]
*  Marco Rubio today, to be pretty illuminating. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=11.4s)]
*  When it came to Hegseth, there actually wasn't much time the Democrats spent badgering or [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  interrogating him about his foreign policy ideology. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=20.88s)]
*  The reason for that is that Pete Hegseth has had the pretty standard bipartisan hawkish [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=23.72s)]
*  view on foreign policy and the Democrats really don't object to that. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=29.28s)]
*  They can't object to that. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=32.32s)]
*  There are so many people, including the Biden administration and the Democratic Senate caucus, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=33.32s)]
*  who agree with that. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=37.64s)]
*  What are they going to do? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=38.64s)]
*  Attack them for having served in the Iraq war when huge numbers of Democrats, including [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=39.64s)]
*  the current president, were vocal advocates of the Iraq war or the war on terror that [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=42.08s)]
*  Obama carried out or regime change in Syria and Libya that Obama did, the NATO war in [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=46.6s)]
*  Ukraine that the Democrats support. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=52.68000000000001s)]
*  And so I thought what was most telling was not anything that Hegseth said particularly [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=56.72s)]
*  about foreign policy, but the way in which Democrats avoided it almost entirely in favor [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=61.76s)]
*  of dreary focus, a dreary focus on culture war issues, on whether the few hundred female [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=65.36s)]
*  infantry members in combat should be able to continue to fight in combat, about other [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=73.44s)]
*  comments that he made along those lines, but more so just delving into the grime of his [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=81.28s)]
*  personal life in a way that was very voyeuristic and morally disgusting. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=89.68s)]
*  Certain things that they raised about his drinking, if the secretary of defense has [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=94.8s)]
*  a drinking problem, and that can be demonstrated, I of course think that alcoholism, active [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=98.24000000000001s)]
*  alcoholism, can be an impediment to doing a job that important. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=105.04s)]
*  I think it's reasonable to probe if you have evidence for it, but probing into his personal [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=107.8s)]
*  life, and by the way, a prior defense secretary nominee, John Tower, who was nominated, I'm [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=112.52s)]
*  pretty sure by Bush 41, and he was in the Senate, so all these were his colleagues and [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=118.75999999999999s)]
*  they thought his nomination would be secured for that reason. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=124.67999999999999s)]
*  The Senate very rarely rejects one of their own, ended up having his nomination either [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=128.28s)]
*  withdrawn or rejected because of concerns about his alcoholism. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=131.64s)]
*  I'm not going to say that's invalid if you have a basis for it, but this kind of inquiry [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=135.48s)]
*  that Senator Tim Kaine pursued, just delving into things like extramarital affairs and [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=139.11999999999998s)]
*  his children, this is the kind of thing you do when you don't have any substantive disagreements [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=148.48s)]
*  with the nominee and so you just try and demean and humiliate and discredit him by exposing [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=153.32s)]
*  the parts of his personal life that while not particularly noble, are not exactly uncommon. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=159.07999999999998s)]
*  Here's part of what Tim Kaine, who by the way was Hillary Clinton's vice presidential [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=165.48s)]
*  nominee in 2016, you probably have forgotten that despite how charismatic and exciting [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=168.4s)]
*  that choice was, but here is what he tried to do to terapeed Hexhep down. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=172.48s)]
*  Fully charged? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=194.68s)]
*  Fully investigated and completely cleared. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=196.68s)]
*  So you think you are completely cleared because you committed no crime. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=198.68s)]
*  That's your definition of cleared. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=202.84s)]
*  You had just fathered a child two months before by a woman that was not your wife. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=204.48s)]
*  I am shocked that you would stand here and say you're completely cleared. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=209.32s)]
*  Can you so casually cheat on a second wife and cheat on the mother of a child that had [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=214.16s)]
*  been born two months before and you tell us you are completely cleared? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=219.96s)]
*  How is that a complete clear? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=224.39999999999998s)]
*  I'm not saying if that behavior is accurately described that it's admirable or noble, obviously. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=226.39999999999998s)]
*  But these people are the party of Bill Clinton. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=235.39999999999998s)]
*  They, every four years, stand on their feet for Bill Clinton and cheer for him. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=239.39999999999998s)]
*  Despite the fact that he not only had extramarital affairs, and according to many of the women [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=245.39999999999998s)]
*  they were not consensual. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=250.32s)]
*  It was sexual harassment in the workplace. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=251.32s)]
*  In the case of Lenny de Broderick, it was rape. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=254.32s)]
*  These are the allegations that have been made. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=257.32s)]
*  Many of them have been substantiated and these Democrats never cared at all. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=259.32s)]
*  And he wasn't the Secretary of Defense, he was the President of the United States. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=262.32s)]
*  But I found so notable how so much of the confirmation hearing was not about his foreign [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=267.32s)]
*  policy views, but about these side shows like this. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=276.24s)]
*  Because the Democrats just don't have many foreign policy disagreements with the Republican [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=279.24s)]
*  establishment, that's why so much of the Republican establishment was aligned with the Democrats [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=284.24s)]
*  and behind Kamala Harris. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=289.24s)]
*  One of the only few people that asked him about his actual views on policy was Tom Cotton, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=292.24s)]
*  who arguably is the most fanatical warmonger in the U.S. Senate. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=298.24s)]
*  I think he's the most extreme authoritarian as well. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=303.16s)]
*  Everything that the MAGA movement claims it stands for, Tom Cotton is the antithesis of [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=306.16s)]
*  it in almost every case, certainly on foreign policy and civil liberties. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=310.16s)]
*  But he actually did ask Pete Hegseth about a foreign policy issue, namely his support [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=313.16s)]
*  for Israel and its war in Gaza. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=320.16s)]
*  It's very odd, it seems like this colloquy took place without any knowledge that Donald [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=322.16s)]
*  Trump was not just pursuing but on the verge of facilitating a peace deal that would call [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=328.08000000000004s)]
*  for the Israelis to stop their hostilities in Gaza and withdraw from there because Tom [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=333.08000000000004s)]
*  Cotton was insisting that Pete Hegseth affirm the right of Israel to continue to destroy [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=338.08000000000004s)]
*  Gaza with U.S. help. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=342.08000000000004s)]
*  Here's what that exchange was. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=343.08000000000004s)]
*  Many of them seem to be patriotic supporters of you, Mr. Hegseth. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=346.08000000000004s)]
*  Some of them seem to be liberal critics of you. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=350.08000000000004s)]
*  I would note that it's only the liberal critics that have disrupted this hearing. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=354.0s)]
*  As was my custom during the Biden administration, I want to give you a chance to respond to [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=358.0s)]
*  what they said about you. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=364.0s)]
*  I think the first one accused you of being a Christian Zionist. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=365.0s)]
*  I'm not really sure why that is a bad thing. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=369.0s)]
*  I'm a Christian, I'm a Zionist. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=372.0s)]
*  Zionism is that the Jewish people deserve a homeland in the ancient holy land where [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=374.0s)]
*  they've lived since the dawn of history. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=381.92s)]
*  Do you consider yourself a Christian Zionist? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=382.92s)]
*  Senator, I support, I'm a Christian and I robustly support the state of Israel and its [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=385.92s)]
*  existential defense and the way America comes alongside them is a great honor. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=390.92s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=395.92s)]
*  Another protester, and I think this one was a member of Code Pink, which by the way is [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=396.92s)]
*  a Chinese communist front group these days, said that you support Israel's war in Gaza. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=399.92s)]
*  I support Israel's existential war in Gaza. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=406.92s)]
*  I assume like me and President Trump, you support that war as well, don't you? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=409.92s)]
*  Senator, I do. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=413.84000000000003s)]
*  I support Israel destroying and killing every last member of Hamas. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=414.84000000000003s)]
*  It's so bizarre that they had that exchange one day before Trump said, I got a deal for [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=419.84000000000003s)]
*  Israel to stop destroying Gaza. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=428.84000000000003s)]
*  And I think what this shows is that there are a lot of people that Trump chose who have [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=433.84000000000003s)]
*  ideas that a lot of people pointed to to try and say, oh, anyone who's convinced about [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=437.84s)]
*  Trump's anti-war position is stupid, is naive, look at all these people he appointed. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=442.0s)]
*  This proves that he has no interest in any of that. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=448.2s)]
*  And what I think this proves is that the person who's going to be making the big decisions [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=450.71999999999997s)]
*  about policy is not Marco Rubio or Pete Hegseth. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=456.17999999999995s)]
*  It'll be Donald Trump, at least in a lot of those cases. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=461.59999999999997s)]
*  And sometimes Trump is going to decide in a way that is very militaristic. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=463.76s)]
*  But a lot of times he won't. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=468.52s)]
*  And this whole incident that we just are now going through with Israel is, I think, perfect [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=470.04s)]
*  proof of that. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=474.72s)]
*  There is evidence that suggests that drinking two to three cups in the morning of coffee [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=475.72s)]
*  could slash your risk of death by 29 percent and cut your chances of heart complications [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=482.16s)]
*  by nearly half. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=487.6s)]
*  But that's not the only benefit you get from drinking your coffee. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=488.6s)]
*  Coffee can also be helpful in fighting censorship while tasting excellent. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=492.16s)]
*  That's why I've always been proud to have 1775 Coffee as a supporter of our show. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=497.64000000000004s)]
*  This isn't just coffee. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=501.6s)]
*  It's like a rebellion in every cup, in every sip. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=503.16s)]
*  It's hand picked at high altitudes and sourced from single origin farms. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=505.96000000000004s)]
*  1775 Coffee delivers bold flavor and real benefits that Starbucks' crappy sugar company [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=509.72s)]
*  can't touch. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=515.24s)]
*  Boost your metabolism, protect your heart, and stay sharper than a debate on free speech, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=516.24s)]
*  whether it's beans, grounds, or pods, every sip of 1775 Coffee takes a stand against a [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=521.0s)]
*  sugar-packed mediocrity. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB0NtkO4iGU&t=527.1999999999999s)]
