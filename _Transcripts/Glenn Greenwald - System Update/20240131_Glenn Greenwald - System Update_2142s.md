# Glenn Greenwald x Destiny: The Jan 6 Rematch
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [January 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o)
*  If Donald Trump, let's assume that you are right that Donald Trump had an intention to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=0.0s)]
*  incite a coup or an insurrection in the United States that he was hell-bent on breaking the [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=12.32s)]
*  law in order to cling to political power. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=16.68s)]
*  There were all sorts of things that he not only could have done, but that typically people [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=19.56s)]
*  trying to perpetrate coups in almost every case do do. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=24.96s)]
*  Namely, right up until the time that he peacefully walked out of the White House on January 20th [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=29.16s)]
*  before noon, which is the time when the peaceful transition of power occurs, Trump was the [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=33.88s)]
*  commander in chief of the armed forces, he was the head of the executive branch, which [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=39.28s)]
*  means under his command he had the entire US military, all sorts of agencies that are [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=43.0s)]
*  very well armed and very trained and all of whom are duty bound to obey his orders. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=48.84s)]
*  Maybe some of them would have refused, but probably a lot of them would have obeyed, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=54.28s)]
*  a lot of them were probably on his side. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=57.84s)]
*  We heard for years how there were all these fascist and white supremacist factions within [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=59.28s)]
*  these military units. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=63.760000000000005s)]
*  Why do you think that if Donald Trump wanted to perpetrate a coup, he didn't do what almost [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=66.04s)]
*  every other person capable of this, who perpetrated the coup has done, which is order the military [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=71.22s)]
*  or these other armed agencies to surround the White House, keep anybody who tried to [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=76.0s)]
*  come in and get him out and ensure that he remains in power using violence or other [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=80.64s)]
*  illegitimate and illegal means? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=86.32000000000001s)]
*  Why didn't he even try that? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=87.64s)]
*  You're asking me why Donald Trump didn't order the military when he already thought [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=89.84s)]
*  Milley was literally a treasonous actor for not giving him all the information that he [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=95.32000000000001s)]
*  thought he was entitled to for military units. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=99.36s)]
*  You're asking me why he didn't ask the military to help him when he already disagreed with [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=101.48s)]
*  so many members of the military. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=104.8s)]
*  You're asking why he didn't ask the intelligence services to help him that he had said since [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=105.8s)]
*  the start of his presidency were engaged in Russia collusion hoax and with Peter Strock [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=108.76s)]
*  and his text messages and with the Hunter Biden laptop that were all set against him. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=112.56s)]
*  You're asking me the question of why didn't Donald Trump order the very parts of his government [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=116.0s)]
*  that he thought were backstabbing the most to help him ensure his coup? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=120.24000000000001s)]
*  Is that what you just be clear? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=122.84s)]
*  That's the question you're asking me? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=123.92s)]
*  Yeah, and I'll tell you why. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=124.92s)]
*  Okay, the answer. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=125.92s)]
*  The answer why is because he didn't have any of these people on his side and he knew it. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=126.92s)]
*  That's why he fired people like Comey. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=130.20000000000002s)]
*  That's why he tried to intimidate and bully every other part of his administration that [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=131.84s)]
*  wouldn't follow him, whether it was Jeff Sessions when he served his temporary 30 general [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=135.04000000000002s)]
*  or whether it was his own trying to undermine his own attorney general Barr when he turned [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=139.36s)]
*  against him, whether it was trying to undermine literally every other part of his government [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=142.6s)]
*  that turned against him. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=145.28s)]
*  Like Donald Trump didn't have any friends anywhere. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=146.36s)]
*  The idea that he wouldn't turn to, you know, other members of the government to help him [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=148.4s)]
*  like the military or the Secret Service agencies or not the intelligence agencies is not only [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=152.4s)]
*  is it like, well, why didn't you do it? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=156.72s)]
*  Well, it's obvious why he wouldn't do it because he didn't think these people had his back. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=157.92000000000002s)]
*  I think the more difficult question for you is that if he really didn't think that there [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=161.0s)]
*  was going to be like violence at the Capitol, if he really didn't want any of that to happen, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=165.12s)]
*  why didn't Donald Trump pick up the phone and call anybody to get the National Guard [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=169.48000000000002s)]
*  there to protect the Capitol building? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=173.56s)]
*  When Pence, when Ivanka, when Meadows went in over and over again, when other congressmen [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=176.08s)]
*  were calling him, why is it that when the violence was at its peak, why was it just [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=181.48000000000002s)]
*  him, Eastman and Giuliani making phone calls to other congressmen to, surprise, surprise, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=185.4s)]
*  delay the certification of the vote? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=191.04000000000002s)]
*  OK, I probably shouldn't answer that, but I want to go back to the question that I posed [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=192.8s)]
*  to you first and the answer that you gave to me. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=197.16s)]
*  Oftentimes, first of all, if it's true that the leaders of the armed forces and the intelligence [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=199.76s)]
*  community and every one of these armed executive agency branches, even including ATM and all [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=207.08s)]
*  the DEA and all these other ones, all were in the posture that they did not regard themselves [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=213.4s)]
*  as duty bound to follow Donald Trump's orders, if you're somebody, and I don't mean you're [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=219.04s)]
*  saying this had already been the case. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=224.0s)]
*  Hold on, can I just as a real quick as a friend, you say this, you just as real quick, you [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=225.79999999999998s)]
*  keep saying this duty bound to follow Trump's orders. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=228.51999999999998s)]
*  The oath that you take is to the Constitution of the United States, not to the president [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=231.16s)]
*  of the United States, just to be very clear. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=235.32s)]
*  But go ahead. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=236.72s)]
*  You have the right. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=237.72s)]
*  No, the president is the head of the executive branch. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=238.72s)]
*  He's the commander in chief of the armed force. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=241.16s)]
*  And he is below the Constitution. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=243.67999999999998s)]
*  He is below the Constitution. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=245.56s)]
*  If you are in the military, you are duty bound to obey orders. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=247.32s)]
*  Now, you can object if you think the order is illegal. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=251.32s)]
*  You do actually have that right. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=254.12s)]
*  And as I said in my question, I'm sure a lot of them would have done that. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=255.76s)]
*  But there's no question that there are members of the military and members in these agencies [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=258.76s)]
*  that absolutely were loyal to Trump. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=264.71999999999997s)]
*  And oftentimes what has happened in coups and those sorts of other things is that members [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=267.03999999999996s)]
*  of the various military branches or the armed wings of the government break up into factions [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=271.21999999999997s)]
*  and often start fighting one another. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=276.88s)]
*  That's how you get a civil war. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=278.52s)]
*  So even if Milley or the leader of the CIA, who at that point was Gina Haspel, who he [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=280.16s)]
*  had actually appointed, would have done what you claim, which is a pretty significant threat [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=286.96000000000004s)]
*  to democracy, they regarded themselves as antithetical or adversarial to the president, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=291.8s)]
*  not subordinate to him. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=297.04s)]
*  There's definitely a good chance that a lot of those people who have guns and run the [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=299.24s)]
*  power structure of the United States would have answered his call and been on his side. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=304.36s)]
*  The fact that he didn't even try is so reflective of the fact that this was not an insurrectionary [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=308.0s)]
*  intent that he walked out of the office peacefully on January 20th at noon, the way every other [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=314.36s)]
*  president previous to him had done as part of the peaceful transition of power. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=320.52s)]
*  There were so many things that he could have done. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=324.84s)]
*  Now tell me, just remind me what the question is that you asked that I promised you I was [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=326.8s)]
*  going to ask. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=330.28s)]
*  Before we do this, can I actually take a step back because I just want to just want to actually [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=331.28s)]
*  take a step back. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=334.56s)]
*  So Glenn, you said it wasn't an insurrection because on January 6th, there was no threat [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=335.56s)]
*  to actually overthrowing democracy or actually doing anything major. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=339.76s)]
*  Destiny, as far as I understood from your previous response, and I want to get this [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=343.36s)]
*  clear before we move on, you're saying it's not just January 6th, it's also all the events [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=346.92s)]
*  leading up to it. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=351.32s)]
*  I think that's a lot of it, but we don't even have to. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=352.6s)]
*  Is it worth going into it just so we exactly know why you think it's an insurrection and [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=355.96s)]
*  what specific events led up to it? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=361.96s)]
*  We can go into that to assign more culpability to Trump, but we don't need that. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=364.04s)]
*  Just on the events of J6 itself, it is very plainly and clearly obvious, unless you have [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=369.04s)]
*  heavy political motivations to believe otherwise, that what happened was an insurrection. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=374.48s)]
*  There's just every single element is there. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=378.64000000000004s)]
*  And we can try to pivot with this like, well, usually people do this. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=381.32000000000005s)]
*  I agree that usually people do some things. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=384.52000000000004s)]
*  But just because usually people do something doesn't mean that that's always the case. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=387.24s)]
*  As you've said yourself, there are constitutional coups. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=390.40000000000003s)]
*  Some people might consider the Enabling Act that, you know, Hitler did in order to become [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=393.02s)]
*  a dictator in Germany was a kind of constitutional coup. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=396.74s)]
*  Some people claim that Ivo Morales in Bolivia was enacting, trying to enact some sort of [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=399.38s)]
*  coup. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=403.18s)]
*  Some people say that in Ukraine, when Yanukovych left and that parliament decided to elect a [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=404.18s)]
*  new president, some people call that a coup. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=408.59999999999997s)]
*  There are lots of coups that can happen that or rebellions or not rebellions, lots of coups [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=410.14s)]
*  that can happen that are for a variety of reasons not involving the military. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=414.65999999999997s)]
*  We can look at the president and say, well, why didn't he try? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=418.34s)]
*  We can think of a number of reasons why he didn't try because he didn't have the support [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=420.58s)]
*  of the military because he thought it would be incredibly risky because he thought it [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=423.38s)]
*  would devolve into chaos. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=426.02s)]
*  He wouldn't have a clean transition of power. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=427.02s)]
*  Nobody here is claiming that Trump is brave. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=428.74s)]
*  Nobody here is claiming that Trump wants to lead an armed insurrection to the White House. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=430.78s)]
*  He wasn't his own handlers told him that he was even allowed to go to the White House, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=434.34s)]
*  even when he begged that he wanted the Secret Service to drive him there. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=437.29999999999995s)]
*  So we can think of a number of reasons why Trump, you know, didn't actually order the [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=439.9s)]
*  military to go and show up and start killing people. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=444.06s)]
*  What I'm curious, though, is to my question, you asked me what my question was. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=446.2s)]
*  Why did Trump sit and watch the violence carry on at the White House, at the Capitol building, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=449.9s)]
*  and not try to intervene despite the fact that he had the authority and many would argue [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=455.09999999999997s)]
*  the responsibility to do so? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=459.58s)]
*  Why would he sit and watch it? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=461.21999999999997s)]
*  Well, first of all, when Trump and people think may have thought he waited too long, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=462.5s)]
*  he realized it took him too long to realize the significance of the events, although I [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=467.62s)]
*  don't see the events as nearly as significant as you. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=472.53999999999996s)]
*  We've had tons of protests before at the Capitol. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=475.41999999999996s)]
*  He knew those people were angry and had gone there to protest. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=478.14s)]
*  But he actually did. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=481.09999999999997s)]
*  First, he went on Twitter and he told everybody there, leave now, don't use violence. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=482.09999999999997s)]
*  Violence is not the kind of thing that we do. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=487.7s)]
*  Hold on, just as a quick fact check, he did not say that in his first... [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=488.7s)]
*  He did not say that on Twitter. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=491.21999999999997s)]
*  Just let Glenn's message flow. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=492.21999999999997s)]
*  He said that on luncheon tweets on January 6th. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=493.21999999999997s)]
*  He absolutely did. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=495.53999999999996s)]
*  Repeating the message that he gave to the crowd before they went to the Capitol, which [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=497.34s)]
*  is, I know that you're going to go there and peacefully protest. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=500.97999999999996s)]
*  That was the message that he consistently delivered to them both before January 6th [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=505.1s)]
*  at the protest and after. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=509.34000000000003s)]
*  Secondly, this again, this was a protest that turned into a riot that was quelled in a [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=511.14000000000004s)]
*  matter of hours. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=516.74s)]
*  It started in the afternoon and it was over in the afternoon. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=518.1s)]
*  And in order to quell it, they didn't even need to open fire. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=521.26s)]
*  As we know now, we should have known this two years ago, but the January 6th commission [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=525.0600000000001s)]
*  and purposefully concealed the videos that negated the kind of narrative they wanted [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=530.06s)]
*  to feed. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=535.02s)]
*  A lot of the people who ended up in the Capitol ended up in the Capitol because the Capitol [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=536.02s)]
*  police opened the door and... [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=540.02s)]
*  This is just not true. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=541.8199999999999s)]
*  Can we focus on one false fact at a time before we dive into like every conspiracy theory [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=542.8199999999999s)]
*  that... [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=545.9399999999999s)]
*  I don't know why people... [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=546.9399999999999s)]
*  It's not a conspiracy theory. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=547.9399999999999s)]
*  It is a conspiracy theory. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=548.9399999999999s)]
*  We've seen all the videos. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=549.9399999999999s)]
*  I watched it on video. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=550.9399999999999s)]
*  Which video? [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=551.9399999999999s)]
*  What video did you watch? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=552.9399999999999s)]
*  The videos that were actually released finally to the public, not handpicked by Adam Schiff [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=554.5799999999999s)]
*  and Liz Cheney. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=558.86s)]
*  Once Kevin McCarthy and then Mike Johnson fulfilled their promise to make sure the public [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=560.3000000000001s)]
*  could see all of the video, not the video that they handpicked. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=564.38s)]
*  You're right. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=567.1800000000001s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=568.1800000000001s)]
*  Are you talking about the footage that McCarthy handpicked to give to Tucker Carlson that [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=569.1800000000001s)]
*  he made a 30 minute documentary out of? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=572.74s)]
*  I'm talking about the decision by Mike Johnson, a promise he made as a condition to be the [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=574.66s)]
*  last speaker to make all of the January 6th surveillance footage available to the public, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=579.26s)]
*  not just the handpicked parts that Liz Cheney and Adam Schiff decided to show us. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=585.1s)]
*  It was all an effort from the very beginning to lie in order to exaggerate and make this [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=589.62s)]
*  event seem much worse than it was, including this insane claim that was an absolute lie [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=594.3000000000001s)]
*  that Brian Sicknick was murdered by a savage mob of Trump supporters when he had his skull [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=599.94s)]
*  bashed in with a fire extinguisher until he died. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=605.88s)]
*  Okay, hold on. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=609.38s)]
*  One fake claim at a time. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=610.38s)]
*  Firstly, Donald Trump's initial tweets were not to leave. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=611.38s)]
*  And when you claim over and over again that they managed to calm it down and three hours [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=616.58s)]
*  to get out, that was because finally, like two or three hours after everything on Trump's [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=620.78s)]
*  – I think it was his third tweet after being begged over and over again after already having [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=625.14s)]
*  the note delivered and sitting on his desk that Ashleigh Babbit had been shot and killed, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=630.58s)]
*  he finally tweeted, okay, you guys can go home. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=634.18s)]
*  We love you. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=636.98s)]
*  You're very special. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=637.98s)]
*  Congratulations. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=638.98s)]
*  The initial two tweets that Donald Trump tweeted were not telling people to go home. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=640.0600000000001s)]
*  He already knew there was an ongoing riot and he tweeted to encourage his supporters [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=645.66s)]
*  to continue protesting. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=650.3000000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump was the president of the United States who was the highest on the pecking [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=652.26s)]
*  order for delivering the National Guard to protect the Capitol building and he failed [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=655.66s)]
*  to do that. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=659.62s)]
*  He failed to do that duty that he had that was exclusively under the purview of the president [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=660.62s)]
*  because D.C. is federal ground and he didn't do it to stop his protesters that were there [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=665.6800000000001s)]
*  to try to delay the certification of the vote of an election that he lost. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=670.0600000000001s)]
*  And during that three-hour time period, all he was doing was making phone calls or telling [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=673.5s)]
*  Giuliani, his stooge, to make phone calls to other congressmen to delay the certification [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=677.74s)]
*  of the vote, which is exactly what he was trying to do, which is exactly what an insurrection [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=682.2600000000001s)]
*  is, to having a large group of people engaged in violence trying to stop the lawful execution [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=685.74s)]
*  of government action, which is exactly what every historical person has believed. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=689.74s)]
*  The fact that you have to resort to this kind of nitpicky behavior, like, oh, he didn't [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=693.62s)]
*  tweet soon enough, it took three whole hours to get these people very easily to march peacefully [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=699.9399999999999s)]
*  out of the Capitol is more than anything that I could do to show what an absurd farce this [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=708.18s)]
*  entire thing is. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=714.5799999999999s)]
*  Like you mentioned other historical examples, and by the way, like, please stop the time [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=715.98s)]
*  to constantly proclaim, like, everybody agrees with me, it's so clearly and provably true [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=720.62s)]
*  that what I'm saying is correct. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=725.3399999999999s)]
*  These are not arguments. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=726.5799999999999s)]
*  Let's just, like, eliminate that fluff and try and focus on, like, the substance. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=727.58s)]
*  You can go and do all your post-videos, like, post-debate videos about why you won to your [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=731.3000000000001s)]
*  audience, but for now, let's just focus on the facts. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=735.9000000000001s)]
*  Okay, focus on the facts. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=737.9000000000001s)]
*  On the facts. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=738.9000000000001s)]
*  How did the first people get into the Capitol building? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=739.9000000000001s)]
*  Are they let in or do they break in? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=740.9000000000001s)]
*  Let me- [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=741.9000000000001s)]
*  Let me- [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=742.9000000000001s)]
*  Let's go back to the tweet. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=743.9000000000001s)]
*  I just want to focus on the tweet because, Destiny, you said that you actually posted [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=744.9000000000001s)]
*  tweets encouraging them to actually continue. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=747.5s)]
*  What tweets were those? [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=751.0200000000001s)]
*  Because Glenn said, of course, that was- he actually told them to stop. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=752.1s)]
*  So when the riots were going on at the Capitol, Mark Meadows, because other people went to [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=755.78s)]
*  him and other people, continued to go in. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=764.3s)]
*  Initially, it was to talk to Trump, and then I think just to Meadows because Trump had [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=767.14s)]
*  locked himself in his room just watching what was going on, begging him to please tweet [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=769.98s)]
*  out something and stop. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=774.74s)]
*  Tell your supporters to go home. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=776.36s)]
*  And for the first two tweets that Trump sent out, he refused to tell people to go home [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=778.24s)]
*  because he enjoyed the protest, because he liked the violence, because he thought it [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=782.22s)]
*  would probably increase his chances of furthering, delaying the certification of the vote. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=785.58s)]
*  But those first two tweets that he sent, yes, after three hours when he realized that it [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=790.26s)]
*  wasn't going to help. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=794.3000000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=795.3000000000001s)]
*  On the third tweet, if you look at any of the examples, even like you mentioned Bolivia, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=796.3000000000001s)]
*  where the coup was not, according to most observers of Bolivia, that Evo Morales tried [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=800.22s)]
*  to stay in office. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=806.5s)]
*  Evo Morales was given the go ahead to run for a term by the electoral court appointed [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=807.5s)]
*  by the Constitution to make those judgments and allowed him to run for a fourth term. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=812.74s)]
*  Evo Morales ran, he won. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=817.46s)]
*  People in the West claim because they didn't want him to win that, and it's so ironic, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=820.68s)]
*  the fraud claim ended up being because he was only eight or nine points ahead and you [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=825.7s)]
*  have to be 10 points in order to run off and win on the first round, that a bunch of Morales [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=829.14s)]
*  votes came in late at night to put him over that 10%. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=834.46s)]
*  Very similar to Trump's claim about why there was fraud. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=837.62s)]
*  It's absolutely not similar. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=839.8000000000001s)]
*  The claim was that those servers that were being ran were completely and totally unmonitored [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=841.48s)]
*  and not part of any election monitoring procedure and that nobody could verify any of the votes [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=846.1s)]
*  that were going in and out of that server. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=850.98s)]
*  I absolutely know what I was talking about. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=852.6600000000001s)]
*  And the fact that you say that Evo Morales was allowed to run for another term, the reason [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=854.38s)]
*  why people accuse him of being a coup is because, or why they thought it was, was because he [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=857.98s)]
*  was in charge of electing or appointing a lot of the court members that would eventually [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=861.18s)]
*  go on to overturn the part of the Constitution that allowed him to run for a third and fourth [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=865.14s)]
*  term. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=868.5s)]
*  The idea that he just said that the- [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=869.5s)]
*  Right, because he had been president for 12 years. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=870.5s)]
*  Because he had been president, but he had been president, let me make my point about [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=871.5s)]
*  Bolivia, because he was president for 12 years. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=873.6999999999999s)]
*  What happened was when he was declared the winner and even think tanks that had suspected [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=876.66s)]
*  fraud ultimately reviewed all of what happened and the reason there were so many pro Morales [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=880.3399999999999s)]
*  votes at the end is because the outer regions with indigenous and rural voters, which had [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=885.0999999999999s)]
*  always been his base, are always the votes that come in late and which is what put him [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=889.9399999999999s)]
*  over the top. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=894.02s)]
*  But not only did I report on this, I was the first journalist to interview Evo Morales [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=895.18s)]
*  in English after that series of events. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=899.06s)]
*  And in order to interview him, I couldn't go to Bolivia. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=901.6999999999999s)]
*  You know why I couldn't go to Bolivia? [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=904.74s)]
*  Because he had been driven out of Bolivia by the military and the police that threatened [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=906.26s)]
*  to murder him and his whole family if he didn't leave Bolivia. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=909.66s)]
*  He then had to go to Mexico where he sought asylum and that's where I interviewed him. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=913.74s)]
*  And then in that next week, the interim coup government, the leaders of whom are now in [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=917.62s)]
*  prison, ended up murdering all of the, not all, but many of the peaceful protesters who [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=921.8199999999999s)]
*  were contesting the fact that the military and the police drove Evo Morales out of the [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=927.66s)]
*  country. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=931.78s)]
*  That's what happens in a coup when the people with the guns come and say, we're now taking [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=932.78s)]
*  over. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=937.38s)]
*  We're going to decide who's in power. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=938.38s)]
*  We don't care that you were certified the winner of the election. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=939.78s)]
*  We demand that you either leave Bolivia or we're going to murder you. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=942.4599999999999s)]
*  Every event that is seriously viewed as a coup, whether the coups in South America throughout [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=946.54s)]
*  the Cold War, the coup in Iran that has happened, you go through all over the world and you [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=952.5s)]
*  look at coups, almost always they involve not 100 people or 120 people for two hours [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=956.9s)]
*  protesting and rioting in the capital, none of whom pulled out a gun and discharged a [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=963.62s)]
*  weapon at any point. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=967.78s)]
*  It involves real sustained violence by the serious factions in that country that dominate [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=969.62s)]
*  with violence and nothing like that happened here on January 6th. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=975.54s)]
*  The reality was there was violence on J6. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=980.14s)]
*  You literally, we've all watched the videos. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=983.4599999999999s)]
*  There were a small number of Trump supporters, as I said, 10% of the people charged who were [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=986.06s)]
*  engaged in fighting with the police. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=991.14s)]
*  How did they get into the, how did they get into the Capitol? [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=994.14s)]
*  Glenn, how did they get into the Capitol? [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=995.14s)]
*  They used force in order to break in. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=997.42s)]
*  Yes. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=999.06s)]
*  I'm not saying that. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1000.06s)]
*  Okay, so they used force to break into the Capitol. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1001.06s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1002.8199999999999s)]
*  How did they get through the rest when cops were pointing guns at them saying, don't come [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1003.9000000000001s)]
*  in here? [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1006.62s)]
*  What were they doing? [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1007.62s)]
*  They were breaking windows. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1008.62s)]
*  How did Ashley Babbit get shot? [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1009.62s)]
*  They were trying to go to places where lawmakers were where they were saying, don't come. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1010.62s)]
*  And what did they end up doing? [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1013.0400000000001s)]
*  They delayed the certification of the vote or the execution of the law of Congress and [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1014.22s)]
*  the Constitution. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1018.82s)]
*  How many people, how many people in January 6th? [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1019.82s)]
*  All of these questions are bullshit. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1024.46s)]

*  Is that killing themselves? [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1062.1799999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1063.1799999999998s)]
*  Well, the only people who died, right, you can say some of them actually died and one [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1064.1799999999998s)]
*  of them was shot by the Capitol Hill police. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1069.26s)]

*  militarized nation in the world did not kill a single person on January 6th. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1076.34s)]

*  political parties. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1103.62s)]

*  No, if you assume that Trump believed that there was serious voter fraud in Georgia, [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1156.0600000000002s)]

*  The reason is, is because you have blinders on, you only know the CNN version of the world. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1249.82s)]
*  You're one of those people who only began paying a percentage of dollars in 2015. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1255.18s)]
*  Let's just be very clear then. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1258.0600000000002s)]
*  Because of Donald Trump. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1259.26s)]
*  Sure. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1260.26s)]
*  Would you say that the battle of Fort Sumter, would you consider that the Fort Sumter event, [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1261.26s)]
*  would that have been an insurrection to you? [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1264.46s)]
*  Even when one person died? [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1267.02s)]
*  Without anything else that followed? [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1268.38s)]
*  Without the entire Civil War happening? [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1269.7800000000002s)]
*  Yes, without anything else that followed. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1270.7800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1271.7800000000002s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1272.7800000000002s)]
*  I don't know if I would consider that an insurrection or not. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1273.7800000000002s)]
*  Okay, so for the whiskey insurrection where no- [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1276.1000000000001s)]
*  The reason that Fort Sumter is because of the part that it played in the Civil War. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1278.22s)]
*  It's the Civil War that made that so historic. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1281.26s)]
*  Well, that's fine, but again, your analysis there is ahistorical. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1284.1399999999999s)]
*  Because people considered that others that were giving aid to Confederate states as they [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1287.7s)]
*  succeeded before any actual violence happened were insurrectionists. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1291.7s)]
*  So if you think that Fort Sumter was not an insurrection of the Civil War followed, that's [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1295.5s)]
*  fine. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1298.66s)]
*  That's an insane take. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1299.66s)]
*  Given especially given that Lincoln literally invoked the Insurrection Act right after Fort [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1303.26s)]
*  Sumter, but that's fine. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1306.82s)]
*  If you think that wasn't an insurrection, okay. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1307.82s)]
*  So for the whiskey rebellion then, do you think for the whiskey insurrection that also [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1309.58s)]
*  wasn't an insurrection because people didn't die or- [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1313.1799999999998s)]
*  Fort Sumter did not just appear out of nowhere. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1315.9399999999998s)]
*  It was not a spontaneous protest that turned into a riot. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1318.58s)]
*  It was part of what became an obvious attempt on the part of the South to launch a rebellion [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1321.5s)]
*  against the North and to secede from the Union. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1326.62s)]
*  Lincoln knew what was going to follow. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1329.6599999999999s)]
*  And I think this is an important point. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1331.8999999999999s)]
*  If what happened after January 6th involved acts of Donald Trump trying to extend what [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1333.74s)]
*  happened on January 6th by repeating violent protest or trying to threaten the stability [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1340.78s)]
*  of the United States government and all the different ways that he could have done but [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1345.5s)]
*  chose not to, had he not walked out peacefully of the White House on January 20th, we would [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1348.82s)]
*  be looking at all of these sets of events differently. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1355.18s)]
*  That's an imaginary history that would make it more like the Civil War. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1357.3799999999999s)]
*  None of that happened, however. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1360.94s)]
*  So Fort Sumter, if the Civil War- [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1361.94s)]
*  All we have is a free Orion and Donald Trump walked out of the White House peacefully. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1362.94s)]
*  So the Civil War, or for Fort Sumter, for the Civil War that followed, if that hadn't [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1367.06s)]
*  had followed, even though Lincoln invoked the Insurrection Act to deal with Fort Sumter, [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1372.74s)]
*  you would say that that wasn't an attempted insurrection. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1377.98s)]
*  That wasn't an insurrection. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1379.98s)]
*  I mean, it's such a counterfactual and such a hypothetical that it's impossible to imagine [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1380.98s)]
*  taking Fort Sumter, tearing it out of its context of a nation that had been heading [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1386.22s)]
*  for Civil War for a long time where they were doing everything possible to avert it. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1390.34s)]
*  And understood that Fort Sumter was not some isolated event of a two hour riot that was [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1395.42s)]
*  easily subdued, but knew that the entire South was armed to fight against the North. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1399.7s)]
*  Take Fort Sumter and completely change every single fact and tear it out of its historical [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1405.5s)]
*  context and then trying to debate whether or not its insurrection is a child's game. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1409.42s)]
*  There's so many classical poos. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1414.1000000000001s)]
*  Let's say that after Fort Sumter, let's say they were crushed so hard and so fast that [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1415.1000000000001s)]
*  there was a sweeping change of mind among the states and they were like, you know what? [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1418.66s)]
*  Oof, this Lincoln guy seems serious. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1422.42s)]
*  Let's not go to war and have hundreds of thousands of us die. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1424.22s)]
*  And they decide to do to not do that instead. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1426.5800000000002s)]
*  In your eyes, Fort Sumter would have then not been an insurrection. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1428.8000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I think there's a good analogy to that, which is the one I mentioned earlier, which [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1431.8600000000001s)]
*  is what happened in Russia where progosian. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1434.78s)]
*  No, no, let's just talk about the United States. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1436.66s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1438.78s)]

*  election. That's what it sounds like. And then maybe a few of them got led in by the [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1653.94s)]
*  Capitol police to walk around. Thankfully, however, thank God we're in an era where we [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1657.3799999999999s)]
*  all have videos, we all have the internet, we can see the tens of thousands of people [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1662.74s)]
*  outside screaming. We can watch the brawling with the Metropolitan police. That's not all [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1667.22s)]
*  they did, Glenn. We can watch them brawling with the Metropolitan police. We can watch [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1672.42s)]
*  them breaking into the Capitol from like 500 different angles. We can watch Ashley Babbitt [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1676.26s)]
*  getting shot as she's trying to crawl through a window where lawmakers are in direct opposition [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1681.58s)]
*  to federal police shooting her. We can watch every single one of these events unfold in [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1685.8600000000001s)]
*  real time and it doesn't look like anything that's being described by Glenn. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1689.74s)]
*  Instead, the only response is Glenn says we saw the real videos because Tucker Carlson [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1693.54s)]
*  published 0.3% of the footage that McCarthy granted him. That doesn't change any of the [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1697.74s)]
*  underlying facts of what we've seen. Yeah, were there some people that were walking through [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1701.98s)]
*  the Capitol building because the police were trying to guide them to another area where [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1705.34s)]
*  they could more heavily more easily secure it? Yeah, of course. Were some people guided [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1708.94s)]
*  through and then led into a chamber because police had an easier control of that area [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1712.46s)]
*  than something else? Yeah, sure. But again, we've all seen the videos. You admitted yourself [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1715.22s)]
*  that the first entrance into the Capitol broke in. The first people to breach the barricades [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1719.3s)]
*  broke them down. If nobody was let into a new initial area because the Capitol police [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1723.66s)]
*  let them in, they were only sometimes ushered through the building because there are more [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1727.74s)]
*  defensible positions, which is obvious if you've watched any of the video footage available [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1730.86s)]
*  of that day besides the selected clips that people like Tucker Carlson or Glenn Greenwald [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1734.3s)]
*  want you to watch on Twitter. Again, if this was so easy and so simple and there was nobody [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1738.82s)]
*  there but a bunch of fat people, how did the certification of our vote get delayed by three [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1742.82s)]
*  hours? And why are we waiting for the national for the first time in all of history? Three [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1746.74s)]
*  hours, three hours. How did the republic survive? First of all, let me just clarify. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1751.66s)]
*  Glenn, how long was the story about Hunter's laptop delayed? How many days was that delayed? [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1756.74s)]
*  One day. You guys say that that was a more serious thing, right? Because the story is [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1761.78s)]
*  delayed by one day. Come on. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1765.3400000000001s)]
*  Facebook suppressed that story all the way up until the time of the election algorithmically. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1766.38s)]
*  But let me just, I want to go back to the history of what we saw with the videos because [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1770.8600000000001s)]
*  you obviously are not familiar with this history. At the beginning for two years, all of the [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1775.46s)]
*  information that we got about January 6th was controlled by a partisan commission filled [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1781.5s)]
*  with effectively Democrats. The people Nancy Pelosi let onto the commission, Liz Cheney, [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1786.7s)]
*  Adam Kinzinger hated Trump almost more than any Democrat did. Those were the two Republicans [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1792.42s)]
*  because Nancy Pelosi broke the tradition. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1797.02s)]
*  Just as a quick thing, you can't lie. That's not true. Pelosi would have allowed others. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1798.02s)]
*  Pelosi was going to allow people on there. But unfortunately, McCarthy, when he nominated [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1802.46s)]
*  five, two of those people, Jim Jordan and something, Johnson, I think maybe. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1806.3s)]
*  Can I just finish? [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1810.7399999999998s)]
*  Well, you're just lying. You can't just lie. You can't just say that things are lies. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1811.7399999999998s)]
*  No, I'm not. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1815.4199999999998s)]
*  Pelosi accepted people from McCarthy. McCarthy didn't want to nominate more people. That's [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1816.4199999999998s)]
*  his fault. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1818.6999999999998s)]
*  Sorry, go ahead. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1819.6999999999998s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi was the first ever speaker of the House in 225 years to reject the nominees [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1820.6999999999998s)]
*  by the opposing party to serve on an investigative commission. It had never happened in the history [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1829.02s)]
*  of the United States. She was the first one to do it. And so Nancy Pelosi said... [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1834.1s)]
*  We asked Destiny that question. Why did Nancy Pelosi reject those two Republican? Why did [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1839.94s)]
*  she reject them? [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1844.3799999999999s)]
*  So when Nancy Pelosi was forming this committee, she said that McCarthy could nominate five [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1845.54s)]
*  people. Of those five people, I think it was Jim Jordan and somebody banks, two of these [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1850.18s)]
*  people, a lot of the J6 investigations were probably going to be analyzing their behavior [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1855.26s)]
*  specifically. And Pelosi felt like the presence of those two people on the committee would [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1859.98s)]
*  have poisoned the committee. So she told McCarthy, I accept your other three nominees. Just give [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1863.74s)]
*  me two others and they can be part of the committee as well. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1868.1000000000001s)]
*  But McCarthy, because he knew January 6th was an insurrection and because he knew that [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1870.6200000000001s)]
*  the behavior that day was indefensible, decided to pull all the Republican nominees and say, [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1874.42s)]
*  you know what? Screw you. I'm not going to give you anybody. You can just have Kissinger [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1878.14s)]
*  and Cheney or whatever, the two people that I know hate Trump, so that afterwards, conveniently, [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1881.8200000000002s)]
*  people like Glenn can make this exact bullshit argument where they say, oh, well, actually, [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1886.18s)]
*  it was a completely partisan committee. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1889.96s)]
*  So I'm going to ignore the fact that 95% of the people that were actually testifying were [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1891.42s)]
*  Republicans and ignore the fact that all of this under oath and ignore the fact that all [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1895.5s)]
*  the evidence is easily available. And I'm just going to hand wave all of it by calling [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1898.38s)]
*  it partisan. Meanwhile, I'm going to believe everything that I guess Russia Today tweets [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1901.42s)]
*  about it or everything that Tucker Carlson puts on his show about it or everything that [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1905.18s)]
*  McCarthy himself says about it. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1909.54s)]
*  That was the thing. Yeah, go ahead. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1910.94s)]
*  Eli, I just want to go back to the history of the... First of all, I'll say one more [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1911.94s)]
*  time. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1915.6200000000001s)]
*  Oh, the videos. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1916.6200000000001s)]
*  Never before in the history of the Republic did Nancy Pelosi, did any speaker of the House [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1917.6200000000001s)]
*  or majority leader do what Nancy Pelosi did. The prerogative of the minority party to [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1921.18s)]
*  pick their own members to serve on that commission was never subject to the approval of the [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1925.26s)]
*  opposing party until Nancy Pelosi, while the Democratic Party always claims it's upholding [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1930.5s)]
*  norms and how and tradition, decided to block the choices. And so it's true. The Republicans [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1935.86s)]
*  decided we're not going to participate in a farce where for the first time in 225 years [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1941.3s)]
*  of our history, Nancy Pelosi gets to choose who cannot be on the panel, even though that's [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1946.18s)]
*  who we want and think will be most effective on there. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1951.54s)]
*  And as a result, Nancy Pelosi ended up choosing those two Republicans. They were the ones [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1954.06s)]
*  willing to serve when the rest of the Republicans weren't. And it became a partisan farce. Had [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1958.54s)]
*  she allowed Kevin McCarthy's members, the way every other speaker for 225 years had [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1962.6599999999999s)]
*  done, you would have had an actual bipartisan commission. As a result, the only videos that [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1969.1399999999999s)]
*  we saw were videos that were handpicked by these very partisan anti-Trump members who [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1974.5s)]
*  then were allowed to create a narrative filled with lies, beginning with Brian Signet getting [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1980.26s)]
*  his head bashed in and then hiding the videos that undermine their narrative and only allowing [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1984.02s)]
*  us to see the videos that made it look as violent as possible. Then Kevin McCarthy gave [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1989.18s)]
*  the rest of the video, the video to Tucker Carlson so that he could report on them. But [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=1995.22s)]
*  that's not even what I'm talking about. What I'm talking about is that it was Mike Johnson, [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=2000.1s)]
*  the newly elected speaker who released all of the video. And only then did we see the [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=2004.1399999999999s)]
*  video for the very first time after two and a half years of these people who were walking [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=2009.5s)]
*  into the Capitol being leaded by the Capitol police after they opened the doors and led [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=2013.94s)]
*  them in peacefully. So you can say all of these things about January 6th. I said from [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=2017.4s)]
*  the very beginning that your tactic is to create this binary where either someone has [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=2023.34s)]
*  to say- [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=2028.7s)]
*  Hold on a minute, you don't need to do facts as fiber. I don't even have to announce my [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=2029.7s)]
*  tactic. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=2032.22s)]
*  I said from the beginning that it was a riot. There were people who were there on behalf [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=2033.22s)]
*  of Donald Trump who used violence. There were police officers who ended up injured as a [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=2039.22s)]
*  result, just like happened in the Black Lives Matter protest, although actually police officers, [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=2044.26s)]
*  at least one of them for sure, and probably a few others, were killed and the amount of [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=2049.9s)]
*  injuries were far greater. I also don't consider the Black Lives Matter movement, even though [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=2053.68s)]
*  it was a lot of people there had insurrectionary intent, anarchist groups and the Antifa and [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=2057.94s)]
*  others. I don't consider that an insurrection either, though I think you can make a much [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=2062.98s)]
*  stronger case that the damage and violence that it posed to our prevailing law and order [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=2066.46s)]
*  system was far greater than what happened on January 6th. So yes, you are right that [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUr5BIUCx7o&t=2071.7s)]
