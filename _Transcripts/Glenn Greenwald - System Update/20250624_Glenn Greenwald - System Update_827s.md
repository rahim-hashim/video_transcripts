# Is the Israel/Iran Ceasefire Real?
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [June 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI)
*  So there's a lot of news to cover today, a lot of very significant news in this war that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=0.0s)]
*  Israel last week started 10 days ago or so with Iran when they attacked Iran using fighter [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=11.64s)]
*  jets and missiles and bombs of all kinds as well as on the ground, the sought operatives [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=17.82s)]
*  that they had deployed in Iran, blew up a lot of things, killed a bunch of people. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=23.12s)]
*  And the US ultimately joined that war, really was a joint US-Israeli action from the start. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=29.26s)]
*  But Donald Trump over the weekend made the US a direct belligerent by dispatching multiple [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=36.22s)]
*  aircraft including B-52s that are the aircraft that carry bunker busters from very far distances [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=44.120000000000005s)]
*  and bombed the underground nuclear facility at Forto. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=49.96s)]
*  There's been a lot of triumphalist claims about how this has obliterated the Iranian [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=54.08s)]
*  nuclear program. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=58.06s)]
*  There's no way we could actually know that. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=59.34s)]
*  There's been no damage assessment yet of these facilities including at Forto. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=61.46s)]
*  Nobody has any idea whether Iran, knowing that this is coming and certainly it was a [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=65.62s)]
*  very high possibility that it was, it was openly discussed whether they removed heavily [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=69.28s)]
*  enriched uranium and centrifuges prior to these attacks, but certainly it damaged or [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=74.34s)]
*  impeded these facilities and the killing of nuclear scientists that the Israelis did, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=79.74000000000001s)]
*  the assassination of scientists combined with it, I'm certain had a deleterious effect [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=85.02s)]
*  on Iran's ability to develop nuclear energy, to say nothing of nuclear weapons, how much [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=89.61999999999999s)]
*  it damaged it, how much impeded it, we actually don't know and won't know for a good while [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=96.36s)]
*  if we ever really know. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=101.41999999999999s)]
*  So that was obviously the main news that we had planned to cover, but then Iran, as expected, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=103.86s)]
*  they were required to do, launched a retaliatory counter-strike today in response to the US [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=109.72s)]
*  bombing against a US military base, a gigantic military base in Doha, Qatar. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=116.12s)]
*  We often hear that Qatar is this enemy of the United States, that it's the menace of [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=123.04s)]
*  the Middle East, when in reality it hosts the largest military base, US military base [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=127.56s)]
*  that you have in the region. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=133.76s)]
*  If you go to Doha, as I've done, you will be amazed at how sprawling this military base [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=135.39999999999998s)]
*  is, everywhere you go you see US military officials, it's a major important base for [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=139.88s)]
*  the United States in the Middle East, we of course have military bases in countless countries [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=145.64s)]
*  around the world and you can question why we need to have that when China doesn't, most [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=150.39999999999998s)]
*  other countries don't, but the US does have a major one in Qatar and there were only six [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=154.88s)]
*  missiles that the Iranians sent, which they said was a number they picked because that [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=160.28s)]
*  was how many bunker buster bombs the US dropped on Fordow and so they said it was symmetrical, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=165.24s)]
*  but it was not just designed to do no damage and kill nobody, it was actually coordinated [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=171.76000000000002s)]
*  with, or at least the Qataris and the Americans had advanced notice that it was going to be [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=177.84s)]
*  done, the base was evacuated, the Iranians really needed to do something to show its [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=182.44s)]
*  people and the world look, we don't just allow countries to attack us, but they also [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=187.52s)]
*  wanted to prevent Donald Trump from being forced to go and be even more destructive [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=191.36s)]
*  in their country to escalate the war and this was how they did it. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=197.36s)]
*  After that happened and President Trump as we'll show you kind of mocked the Iranians [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=202.24s)]
*  for what was a very weak and deliberately harmless, benign counter strike and said that [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=205.88s)]
*  it was done in advance and he said as far as we're concerned, the Americans, we don't [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=212.72s)]
*  need to counter attack, we did what we want to do, there'll be no more war between the [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=217.32s)]
*  US and the Iranians assuming they do nothing else. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=220.35999999999999s)]
*  He then went and announced, he earlier today said the Israelis, I'm encouraging the Israelis [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=223.12s)]
*  to end the war with Iran too and then just a little bit ago, maybe 30, 45 minutes ago, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=228.2s)]
*  he went to True Social and posted this, quote, congratulations to everyone, it has been fully [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=233.51999999999998s)]
*  agreed by and between Israel and Iran that there will be a complete and total ceasefire [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=239.95999999999998s)]
*  in approximately six hours from now when Israel and Iran have wound down and completed their [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=246.88000000000002s)]
*  in process final missions, meaning they're going to bomb each other in the next six hours. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=252.20000000000002s)]
*  That ceasefire will last 12 hours, he said, at which point the war will be considered [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=257.72s)]
*  ended. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=260.88s)]
*  Officially, Iran will start the ceasefire and upon the 12th hour, Israel will start [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=261.88s)]
*  the ceasefire and upon the 24th hour, an official end to the 12 day war will be saluted by the [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=266.16s)]
*  world. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=272.0s)]
*  Israel has 12 hours to keep bombing, Iran only has six. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=273.48s)]
*  After six hours, the Iranian ceasefire begins. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=276.88s)]
*  Another six hours later, the Israelis begin, and the Israelis have been issuing evacuation [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=279.2s)]
*  notices in Tehran during this time. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=283.88s)]
*  They obviously intend to use that 12 hour window before the ceasefire begins to be as [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=285.48s)]
*  destructive as possible. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=290.28s)]
*  We saw them do that in Gaza as well when President Trump fostered a ceasefire, when other ceasefires [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=291.36s)]
*  happened, the Israelis just keep bombing and killing right up to the last minute. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=297.92s)]
*  President Trump went on, quote, during each ceasefire, the other side will remain peaceful [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=302.52s)]
*  and respectful. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=305.96s)]
*  On the assumption that everything works as it should, which it will, I would like to [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=307.71999999999997s)]
*  congratulate both countries, Israel and Iran, on having the stamina, courage, and intelligence [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=312.24s)]
*  to end what should be called the 12 day war. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=318.44s)]
*  This is a war that could have gone on for years and destroyed the entire Middle East, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=321.78s)]
*  but it didn't and never will. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=325.28s)]
*  God bless Israel. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=326.76s)]
*  God bless Iran. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=328.58s)]
*  God bless the Middle East. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=329.72s)]
*  God bless the United States of America. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=330.84s)]
*  And God bless the world. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=332.64s)]
*  So that's a very triumphalist statement. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=334.0s)]
*  He's obviously proud of the work he did to facilitate and end this conflict. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=341.56s)]
*  And this conflict wouldn't have started had President Trump not authorized the Israelis [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=347.15999999999997s)]
*  to do it, not plotted and planned with the Israelis to do it. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=351.79999999999995s)]
*  They launched an unprovoked attack on Iran, unprovoked in that Iran wasn't planning on [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=354.28s)]
*  attacking anybody, hadn't attacked anybody. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=359.0s)]
*  This is exactly like the Iraq war. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=361.88s)]
*  It wasn't even a preemptive war where we were preempting an attack. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=364.24s)]
*  They came up with a new term, preventative war, like we're trying to prevent them from [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=369.36s)]
*  some time away in the future attacking us with weapons they don't yet have or that we [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=372.88s)]
*  claim they have, but it turns out we didn't. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=376.76s)]
*  There's a brand new way of thinking about war that you don't have to wait for a country [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=378.40000000000003s)]
*  to attack you or imminently attack you or even threatening to attack you in a real way. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=381.84000000000003s)]
*  If you feel like it, you just go and start a war. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=388.3s)]
*  That war killed a lot of people in Iran, killed some people in Israel. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=390.62s)]
*  So there's death, a good amount of death in the wake. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=395.54s)]
*  But it is true that if all of this plays out as President Trump announced it would and [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=398.26000000000005s)]
*  envisions it will, he will have acted to ensure that this war, which had a very high potential [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=403.06s)]
*  for going up the escalation ladder, for involving other countries, for entailing far more destruction, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=411.90000000000003s)]
*  ended relatively quickly as compared to wars, which is why he wants this war to be called [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=418.22s)]
*  the 12-day war. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=423.26s)]
*  I still think President Trump and the Israelis have a lot of blame for starting the war based [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=425.82s)]
*  on absolutely no basis, but it's also true that if everything goes as President Trump [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=429.26s)]
*  says will, it will go, he will have ensured that the war, which again is between two sworn [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=435.3s)]
*  enemies with a lot of weapons, will actually end in only 12 days. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=441.02s)]
*  And there's a lot of reasons why both sides would want an end to this war. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=447.21999999999997s)]
*  Over the last couple of days we've seen that Iran was able to have its missiles land and [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=452.78s)]
*  detonate in Tel Aviv and other places in Israel, even though they were sending fewer and fewer [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=458.58s)]
*  missiles because clearly Israel's air defenses and Iron Dome was starting to become depleted. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=464.02s)]
*  And that was always the race in this war who would determine who would win. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=472.06s)]
*  Would the Israelis run out of air defenses before the Iranians ran out of ballistic missiles [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=476.42s)]
*  or vice versa? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=480.5s)]
*  And so the Israelis are spending a huge amount of money, they're suffering damage, they're [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=482.46000000000004s)]
*  having their citizens killed. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=485.94s)]
*  They still have an ongoing utterly just obscene destruction of Gaza, killing 100 or 150 or [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=488.3s)]
*  200 Palestinians a day, including just massacring them at aid sites where they go to try and [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=496.54s)]
*  get some food, flour and the like. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=501.3s)]
*  So there's benefits for the Israelis. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=504.18s)]
*  There's benefits for Iran, obviously, and having it into this war. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=505.86s)]
*  And then President Trump, obviously, as well, gets to give himself credit and take credit [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=509.09999999999997s)]
*  and probably will get credit for maneuvering the war so that it didn't last nearly as long [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=514.74s)]
*  as it could have. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=519.26s)]
*  Now there have been some doubts about whether the ceasefire is actually finalized here from [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=521.78s)]
*  CNN. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=530.04s)]
*  Here's a headline, Iran has not received any ceasefire proposal, senior official says. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=532.3s)]
*  And the text of this article is, quote, the official said Iran would continue to fight [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=538.66s)]
*  until it achieves lasting peace and that it would view remarks from Israel and the U.S. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=542.02s)]
*  as a, quote, deception intended to justify attacks on Iran's interests. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=546.7199999999999s)]
*  Quote, at this very moment, the enemy is committing aggression against Iran and Iran is on the [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=551.18s)]
*  verge of intensifying its retaliatory strikes with no ear to listen to the lies of its enemy, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=555.3399999999999s)]
*  the official said. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=560.9s)]
*  Professor Said Marandi, who's been on the show a couple of times now, he's an Iranian [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=563.66s)]
*  American professor. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=569.98s)]
*  He has been close to the government in Iran. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=571.1s)]
*  He's in Tehran. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=573.88s)]
*  He after President Trump announces took to facts and he said, quote, no ceasefire, fake [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=575.5s)]
*  news, Zionists are in trouble. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=580.5s)]
*  So at least some Iranians were denying that there is in fact a ceasefire. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=582.78s)]
*  Just a couple of minutes before we went on the air, there was a conflicting report. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=587.06s)]
*  This one from Amlaj Media, which is a Persian language, Iran-based media outlet, and they [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=590.82s)]
*  have this headline exclusive, quote, conclusion to Iran-Israel war agreed after Israeli-Iranian [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=599.1800000000001s)]
*  retaliation over U.S. bombings. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=605.9000000000001s)]
*  Quote, Iran and Israel are set to end their war, informed Iranian sources have told Amlaj [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=607.3000000000001s)]
*  Media. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=613.0200000000001s)]
*  Israel is expected to stop firing at 3.30 a.m. Jerusalem time on June 23rd with the anticipation [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=614.0200000000001s)]
*  that Iran will respond by also ceasing offensive military operations. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=619.82s)]
*  Soon after, the truce will transition to a, quote, conclusion of the conflict, a senior [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=624.22s)]
*  source in Tehran explained. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=628.4200000000001s)]
*  Confusion initially emerged over whether there was an agreement between the two sides, which [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=630.82s)]
*  has been denied by some Iranian sources. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=634.6600000000001s)]
*  The denial of the existence of an accord is likely tied to Tehran's principled stand that [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=637.38s)]
*  it will not only resume talks with Donald Trump once Israel, that it will only resume [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=641.22s)]
*  talks with Donald Trump once Israel has stopped firing, and that since Iran was not the party [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=646.22s)]
*  that initiated the conflict, will not be the ones to end it. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=650.5s)]
*  So there is some confusion. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=654.26s)]
*  I have to be honest, certainly we've seen President Trump saying things before that [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=657.1s)]
*  were likely untrue, including his claim that President Xi of China had called him and they [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=662.6600000000001s)]
*  spoke because China was seeking to reach a deal on the trade war and the tariffs and [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=667.22s)]
*  China vehemently denied it. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=673.22s)]
*  And Jesus, I haven't talked to Trump about this at all. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=674.38s)]
*  Who knows who's telling the truth? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=677.6999999999999s)]
*  But Donald Trump is, like any politician, is prone to disinformation, prone to lying. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=679.38s)]
*  Right up until the Israeli attack, he was saying, I hope to resolve this diplomatically [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=685.98s)]
*  when he knew he had already authorized the war with Israel and that those statements [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=690.06s)]
*  made to the public were false, that he hoped to resolve it diplomatically. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=694.04s)]
*  Maybe it was just a ruse to lure the Iranians into a sense of security that no attack was [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=697.98s)]
*  coming so that there'd be some element of surprise. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=703.58s)]
*  But at the very least, there is some basis for seeing this. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=707.54s)]
*  We'll know in six hours one way or the other. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=710.9s)]
*  There's really no need to speculate. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=712.3000000000001s)]
*  I just wanted to give you what side they're saying about whether there's a ceasefire. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=713.3000000000001s)]
*  This is always very touch and go. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=718.22s)]
*  Anytime there's a ceasefire, the Israelis go much further than they've gone. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=720.1s)]
*  That could undermine it if the Iranians do the same thing. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=724.74s)]
*  But Trump is insistent that this has happened and we will see if it's true. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=727.66s)]
*  All right, so I've been talking for a while, but now I want to ask you a question. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=739.18s)]
*  It's a very important question too, very, very crucial. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=742.2199999999999s)]
*  And it's this. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=745.78s)]
*  What if your coffee didn't just wake you up but actually made you feel sharp, focused, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=747.26s)]
*  and ready for the day? [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=751.38s)]
*  Think about that. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=752.54s)]
*  That's the difference with 1775's Peaberry coffee. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=755.38s)]
*  These beans are rare, less than 5% of all coffee grown. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=759.5s)]
*  They're denser, naturally higher in caffeine, and packed with antioxidants. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=762.38s)]
*  And that means more mental clarity, better energy, and zero crash. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=769.26s)]
*  Each bean grows solo, high in the Bolivian mountains, and is hand picked at peak ripeness. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=773.14s)]
*  The result? [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=778.1s)]
*  A smoother, more concentrated flavor that kick starts your metabolism without the acidity [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=779.1s)]
*  or jitters. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=783.4000000000001s)]
*  You're still getting 1775's organic, small batch, small farm, single origin quality, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=785.0400000000001s)]
*  just with a bean that goes above and beyond. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=790.1600000000001s)]
*  Go to 1775coffee.com, use promo code Glenn, and get 15% off its coffee that actually earns [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw0ybHeefkI&t=792.24s)]
