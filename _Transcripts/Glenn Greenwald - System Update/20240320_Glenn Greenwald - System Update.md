# Pro-Israel Right Declares War on Candace Owens
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [March 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A)
*  Another person who has been as vocal and probably even more so is Candace Owens, who is a very [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=0.0s)]
*  prominent conservative voice and what makes the fact that she has become a leading dissenter [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=12.96s)]
*  on the question of Israel and US support for it so notable is that the outlet where she [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  works, the Daily Wire, was an outlet that was founded by Ben Shapiro who continues to be the [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=25.28s)]
*  public face of that news outlet. It's not actually, Ben Shapiro does not run the Daily Wire, he's not [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=31.8s)]
*  actually the CEO, he's not Candace Owens' boss. I think he has a relationship to the Daily Wire [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=38.72s)]
*  similar to the one that I had with The Intercept where I founded The Intercept with Jeremy Scalem or [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=43.6s)]
*  a poitress. I was the public face of it but I didn't run it day to day. Nobody reported to me [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=49.040000000000006s)]
*  there, I wasn't the editor-in-chief, I wasn't hiring and firing. So Ben Shapiro is not the [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=54.64s)]
*  person who hires and fires, that's Jeremy Boring who does that, but he obviously has a huge amount [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=60.0s)]
*  of influence inside the Daily Wire and now you have the Daily Wire founded by Ben Shapiro, arguably [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=65.56s)]
*  the most steadfast and loyal supporter of Israel in the United States in terms of prominent platforms, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=74.36s)]
*  somebody who defends Israel and always has no matter what it does, someone who fervently believes [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=82.88000000000001s)]
*  that American citizens have the duty to finance Israel's military, to finance Israel's wars, to [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=89.56s)]
*  isolate itself as Joe Biden has repeatedly done from the rest of the world at the UN to protect [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=97.12s)]
*  Israel and then you have on the other hand Candace Owens who alongside Tucker Carlson and others like [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=101.28s)]
*  Congressman Thomas Massey, the Republican of Kentucky who's currently a target of AIPAC, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=106.4s)]
*  has been applying conservative principles consistently saying why are we censoring critics [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=111.04s)]
*  of Israel in the United States? Why don't American citizens have the right to criticize Israel, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=120.36000000000001s)]
*  defend the Palestinian cause that they want? Why are people getting fired for criticizing Israel [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=124.04s)]
*  or criticizing Joe Biden for financing Israel? And why should Israel not be held to the same [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=129.44s)]
*  humanitarian standards in the way that they're conducting this war as we hold other countries [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=138.2s)]
*  too? And this has obviously created a lot of tension on the right, the fact that one of their [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=141.92s)]
*  most prominent pundits and journalists, Candace Owens, has become such a radical and outspoken [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=146.64s)]
*  dissident on a policy that has long been embraced by most American conservatives by definition, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=155.04s)]
*  which is that the United States should always pay for and finance and support and protect Israel. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=162.79999999999998s)]
*  This week there was an article in Mediaeat by Isaac Shore who I would describe as a [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=168.39999999999998s)]
*  conservative but most definitely would describe as a ardent Israel supporter who wrote an article [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=176.51999999999998s)]
*  clearly with the intention of calling for Candace Owens to be fired by the DeliWire. The headline [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=183.4s)]
*  was, How Long Will the DeliWire Stand By Candace Owens? And he wrote, quote, over the last six [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=190.0s)]
*  months Owens has worked earnestly and incessantly to cultivate a following on the anti-Semitic right. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=197.16s)]
*  Now let me just stop here and say that one of the primary grievances of American conservatives over [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=204.6s)]
*  the past decade, and it's a grievance that I think has validity and that I have supported and shared, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=212.56s)]
*  is that many people on the liberal left, a kind of faction of the liberal left that remains loyal [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=216.56s)]
*  to the Democratic Party, has one primary tactic when it comes to their opponents, people who see [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=222.96s)]
*  things differently than they when they engage in political debates, and that is to brand their [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=229.48000000000002s)]
*  opponents racists, bigots, white supremacists. It's like sometimes in left-welfl discourse it [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=233.72s)]
*  seems like the only objective is to take anyone who see things differently with you and just call [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=241.84s)]
*  everybody a racist and a bigot, to accuse everybody of seeing things differently than you because [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=246.72s)]
*  they're harboring hatred for a minority group. And this tactic has been rightly condemned by [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=251.92000000000002s)]
*  conservatives as an attempt to destroy the reputation of people who disagree with liberals [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=257.36s)]
*  and to shut down debate. Nobody wants to get called a racist in public, nobody wants to be [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=262.2s)]
*  branded a bigot, and so it's an attempt to create a repressive atmosphere where everybody is afraid [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=268.84s)]
*  to question liberal orthodoxy or Democratic Party orthodoxy. That is exactly the tactic, exactly the [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=273.76s)]
*  tactic down to the detail that Israel's supporters of the United States have always used and continue [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=281.88s)]
*  to use against anyone who criticizes Israel, against anyone who questions why the American [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=289.2s)]
*  government is supporting Israel, you will immediately be called a racist, not by liberals, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=294.68s)]
*  but by pro-Israel conservatives. You'll be called a racist and anti-Semite. And that will be true [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=301.08s)]
*  whether you're not someone who's Jewish, as Candace Owens is not, she's a Christian, or even if you are [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=307.64s)]
*  a Jew, and a critic of Israel that is not immunity at all, they will accuse you of the same thing. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=313.48s)]
*  Automatically every critic of Israel or someone who opposes the US financing of Israel [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=318.48s)]
*  will, like Candace Owens, just got done here and many times in other places will be called an anti-Semite. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=324.32s)]
*  That is the go-to tactic by the same people who complain incessantly when the left and American [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=329.32s)]
*  liberals do that. This article goes on, quote, Owens has emerged as a fierce critic of Israel, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=336.44s)]
*  arguing its war in Gaza constitutes a genocide. Now I believe that as an American citizen, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=342.56s)]
*  which Candace Owens is, she's allowed to be a fierce critic of Israel. Israel is a foreign country. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=354.08s)]
*  You can be a fierce critic of Russia, you can be a fierce critic of Iran, you can be a fierce critic [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=359.84s)]
*  of China, you can be a fierce critic of Paraguay or South Korea, and you can be a fierce critic of Israel. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=364.56s)]
*  And in fact you ought to have more space, not less, to criticize Israel given that every American [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=371.36s)]
*  taxpayer by definition helps to pay for Israel's military and its wars and its government and [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=377.76s)]
*  therefore gives you a right to criticize that country if you wish. The article goes on, quote, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=382.24s)]
*  her commentary has been laden with amateurish claims. She recently alleged that the historic [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=389.52s)]
*  Muslim quarter of Jerusalem is a state-enforced ghetto, for example. Now the article then goes on [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=395.2s)]
*  and I had pointed this article on Axe and I said, look, it seems like the pro-Israel right is [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=404.08s)]
*  now calling for the same sorts of things that they claim only the left does, namely for people [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=409.52s)]
*  to be fired who disagree with their views. And the author of that piece, Isaac Schor, said to me [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=413.91999999999996s)]
*  something like, well, are you saying you agree with what Candace Owens is saying? And I said, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=420.71999999999997s)]
*  I'm just defending her right to say it. This difference, this distinction is crucial and [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=425.52s)]
*  it's basic and it's been recognized for as long as free speech has. The fact that you're defending [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=431.91999999999996s)]
*  someone's right to say something obviously does not signify your agreement with everything they [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=437.12s)]
*  said. But I said to him, why can't you just admit that the purpose of your article is to get her [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=442.16s)]
*  fired, is to call for her firing because she's a critic of Israel? Now one of the people who [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=446.88000000000005s)]
*  actually first led the way in calling for Candace Owens firing is someone named Rabbi Schmueli who [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=454.88s)]
*  in the pantheon of fanatical Israel supporters is one of the most extremist [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=467.12s)]
*  people there is. He's somebody who enjoys using inflammatory and offensive rhetoric to call [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=475.12s)]
*  attention to himself. He is somebody who I would say is even more extreme in defending Israel than [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=481.20000000000005s)]
*  Ben Shapiro. There's not much space there to Ben Shapiro's more pro-Israel side. If anyone is, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=487.92s)]
*  Rabbi Schmueli is and ironically Rabbi Schmueli has become the primary advisor to RFK Jr. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=494.72s)]
*  when it comes to questions of Israel. RFK Jr. often runs to Rabbi Schmueli in order to embrace [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=503.12s)]
*  him. When Democrats call RFK Jr. anti-Semitic, he runs to Rabbi Schmueli and he vows to do everything [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=509.36s)]
*  possible to support Israel. And here is Rabbi Schmueli and many times he has done so yesterday [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=515.76s)]
*  posting, how long will the daily wire stand by Candace Owens trying to agitate for her firing. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=524.8000000000001s)]
*  Now one of the things that Rabbi Schmueli said about Candace Owens this week, I just want to [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=533.36s)]
*  give you a sense of just how much open season there is on Candace Owens now as a result of her [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=540.88s)]
*  obviously influential critique of Israel. As we just got done seeing and I can show you a million [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=548.5600000000001s)]
*  examples, there's a very sensitive radar for picking up anti-Semitism on the part of Israel [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=555.84s)]
*  critics. In fact, as we're about to show you, Candace Owens did an interview slash debate with [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=563.52s)]
*  a rabbi this week who accused her of being anti-Semitic for all sorts of reasons, including the [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=571.2s)]
*  fact that she had referred to Rabbi Schmueli's daughter as a quote hag, H-A-G hag. And the rabbi [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=577.04s)]
*  said, well, your use of the word hag is anti-Semitic. And Candace Owens said, what? The word hag is [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=584.3199999999999s)]
*  anti-Semitic now? And he explained why there's this 17th and 18th century genesis of the word [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=591.1999999999999s)]
*  hag that was used to demonize Jews and particular Jewish women. Very sensitive heritage of the [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=597.76s)]
*  hair trigger for accusing people of being racist and anti-Semitic. So I want you to look at what [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=606.5600000000001s)]
*  Rabbi Schmueli said this week about Candace Owens, the adjectives that he chose to use [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=611.04s)]
*  to demonize her. This is what he said, quote, I did this video so that Candace Owens troglodyte, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=618.0s)]
*  knuckle dragging, Neanderthal, anti-Semitic thug followers who for days have tried to deep fake my [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=627.76s)]
*  voice with AI racial slurs but have thus far failed miserably since they're a bunch of morons [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=637.52s)]
*  might get my voice more accurately so they can actually persuade people I'm trying to be helpful [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=643.3599999999999s)]
*  guys to listen to my message. So what he's saying here is Candace Owens supporters are accusing Rabbi [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=647.4399999999999s)]
*  Schmueli being a racist and he's saying but I'm not a racist and yet I want you to look at the [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=653.76s)]
*  adjectives that he chose to use for Candace Owens, a black woman. Now anybody who has read my work, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=657.36s)]
*  anybody who has watched my show knows that I very rarely voice racism accusations or [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=664.56s)]
*  bigotry accusations. It's just not a tactic that I think is very helpful. It doesn't mean I don't [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=671.6s)]
*  think people are bigots or harboring racist thoughts or other kinds of bigotries. I know [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=677.28s)]
*  that those are around. I just in general I don't think it's a productive way of trying to engage [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=683.12s)]
*  in discourse which is why I oppose that when left liberals do that as a way of winning debates, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=688.64s)]
*  calling everybody racist and white supremacists and why I also hate it when Israel supporters [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=694.72s)]
*  run around calling everybody anti-Semite to disagree with them in Israel. But what Rabbi Schmueli said [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=700.08s)]
*  about Candace Owens, especially if you're somebody who has a hair trigger for anti-Semitism, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=708.24s)]
*  you see it lurking everywhere where Israel critics appear. The adjectives he chose to use are so [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=713.84s)]
*  blatantly designed to invoke stereotypes about black people when demeaning Candace Owens that [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=720.08s)]
*  it's impossible not to notice. Here's again the adjectives that he chose to use about her. She's [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=726.16s)]
*  a troglodyte and of course he's going to say here that he's talking about her supporters but you see [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=732.8s)]
*  the word Candace Owens that's followed by troglodyte, knuckle dragging, neanderthal, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=737.6s)]
*  and thug, her thug followers. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=746.24s)]
*  So I point this out simply to show you that there are now open calls for Candace Owens to be fired [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=751.28s)]
*  because of reviews on Israel by an American right that has long claimed that it defends free speech, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=758.0s)]
*  not just censorship from the government but the idea that people should be fired especially in [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=764.24s)]
*  journalism because of people disagreeing with their views. And it's now open season on Candace [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=768.32s)]
*  Owens, her character and her job at the Daily Wire to the point that you can invoke the most racist [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=774.32s)]
*  insults possible against Candace Owens and it's totally fine, it's fine because Candace Owens is [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=783.2s)]
*  a critic of Israel and there are no limits as a result on what can be done. Now here is the [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=789.44s)]
*  interview that she did with, I don't know if we have this rabbi's name, I need this rabbi's name, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=796.8800000000001s)]
*  so in my mind we're going to get it for you, we're going to get it for you in a second but [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=803.84s)]
*  basically he tried to present himself as what I would say is kind of like the reasonable [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=807.6800000000001s)]
*  moderate version of Rabbi Shmueli. He definitely is there to say that Candace Owens is an anti-Semite, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=812.1600000000001s)]
*  every critic of Israel is an anti-Semite, anyone who questions why the United States [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=818.48s)]
*  government is paying for Israel's wars absolutely an anti-Semite but he tried, you know, he's wearing [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=822.5600000000001s)]
*  a suit, he tried to adopt the tone that was designed to convince her that she was an anti-Semite. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=827.36s)]
*  Rabbi Shmueli will just call her a monkey basically and be done with it. This rabbi was trying to be [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=833.9200000000001s)]
*  more, it's Rabbi Barclay and so essentially what happened was he was one of the people, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=840.72s)]
*  one of the voices that said Candace Owens is an anti-Semite, questioned why she's associated with [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=848.96s)]
*  the deli wire and so she invited him onto her show to explain or to argue or to persuade her why she [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=854.08s)]
*  is an anti-Semite and so just want to give you a little bit of taste of the dialogue that ensued [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=860.08s)]
*  because it really is such a window into the climate that we have in the United States right [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=866.32s)]
*  now and the space or lack of space that exists for people who want to exercise their absolute right [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=871.6s)]
*  to criticize this foreign country and to question why the United States government is paying for [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=878.5600000000001s)]
*  its military and its wars. Here is this excerpt, can someone play that for me? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=882.1600000000001s)]
*  You could not condemn these sort of events. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=890.48s)]
*  Uniquely evil, you put them in paraphrase relationship. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=893.2s)]
*  You're saying that even though I did, so now you're admitting that I did condemn Hamas. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=897.6800000000001s)]
*  We know she refused to condemn Hamas. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=902.08s)]
*  What condemnation is? Is this where you really want to go? [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=905.04s)]
*  You wrote she refused to condemn Hamas. These are your words. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=909.84s)]
*  Because when you put that, the moment you say that they have a moral equivalency with [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=913.6800000000001s)]
*  anything else, that's not condemnation. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=918.24s)]
*  I didn't. I said it's sad when an innocent. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=920.5600000000001s)]
*  It's not condemnation. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=923.6s)]
*  So you see what happens there and trust me, I've had this lie said about me a million times. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=925.36s)]
*  The October 7th attack by Hamas in Israel happened on October 7th, which was a Saturday. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=934.4000000000001s)]
*  Most people heard about it Saturday night into Sunday morning. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=941.2800000000001s)]
*  The very first show that we had after October 7th was Monday, October 9th. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=946.08s)]
*  And I spent, I would say the first 30 minutes of that program [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=951.04s)]
*  constructing an argument as to why it is that even if you're somebody who believes that Israel [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=958.88s)]
*  has been abusing the Palestinians over decades as I do by occupying illegally the West Bank [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=963.44s)]
*  that does not belong to Israel by expanding settlements in the West Bank rapidly [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=971.04s)]
*  in a way that makes a two-state settlements impossible. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=976.0s)]
*  Even if you're somebody who believes that the Israelis have turned Gaza into an open-air prison [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=982.08s)]
*  by bombing its airport, preventing anybody from leaving by air, killing them if they try [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=991.04s)]
*  and leave by sea, closing the borders along with the U.S. supported dictator in Egypt [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=995.68s)]
*  to prevent them from leaving. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1001.04s)]
*  So they're trapped in this little tiny space of land. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1002.16s)]
*  So it's an open-air prison. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1004.0799999999999s)]
*  Even if you believe as the former head of the Mossad chosen by Benjamin Netanyahu argued in [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1006.2399999999999s)]
*  September of 2023, the month before October 7th, that Israel is an apartheid regime, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1011.92s)]
*  that was his words, the head of the Mossad, the former head of the Mossad. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1017.8399999999999s)]
*  Even if you believe all those things I argued on October 9th, [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1021.04s)]
*  you still can't justify any targeting of civilians inside Israel or anywhere else [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1024.24s)]
*  because the targeting and deliberate killing of civilians as a weapon of war is always unjustified. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1030.64s)]
*  And I argued that on October 10th and October 11th and that has always been my view. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1037.2s)]
*  And just saying in passing, I constructed a long argument as to why I could not find [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1042.64s)]
*  moral justification. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1048.08s)]
*  Obviously, if Hamas attacks military installations or police stations inside Israel, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1049.44s)]
*  those are legitimate targets of war. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1055.1200000000001s)]
*  And Hamas did a lot of that. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1057.44s)]
*  But doing things like going to a rave and recklessly shooting and killing a bunch of [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1059.92s)]
*  civilians or doing them in kibbutz, kidnapping people from Israel to hold them as hostages [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1063.52s)]
*  in Gaza, that I argued at length could not be morally justified. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1069.52s)]
*  It's always been my view and I can't tell you how many times [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1073.8400000000001s)]
*  I've heard in the context of my criticism of Israel or US support for Israel, people say [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1076.3999999999999s)]
*  you've never criticized Hamas or denounced what happened on October 7th and my reaction [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1081.36s)]
*  is just what Candace Owens' reaction is, which is it's just a lie. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1087.4399999999998s)]
*  Just why do you feel justified and just outright lying? [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1091.28s)]
*  So when this rabbi said about Candace Owens and she read the statement she has never condemned [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1095.76s)]
*  Hamas or October 7th, she said I've condemned Hamas repeatedly for what they've done on [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1102.16s)]
*  October 7th and then he switched to the problem is you don't condemn it the way we demand [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1108.24s)]
*  you condemn it, meaning you don't agree that it's a singular evil, that what Hamas did [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1114.8s)]
*  on October 7th is unlike anything that has ever happened in history before, that there's [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1121.04s)]
*  no comparison to it. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1125.3600000000001s)]
*  And that is obviously insane and preposterous. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1127.6s)]
*  What Hamas did on October 7th in Israel was morally unjustifiable but it is not the single [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1133.04s)]
*  greatest act of evil in human history to which nothing can be compared. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1139.2s)]
*  And if you compare other events to October 7th and to Hamas in the course of denouncing [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1144.8799999999999s)]
*  what Hamas did, including things that Israel has done to the Palestinians, it doesn't give [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1152.24s)]
*  people the right to then still falsely accuse you of not having condemned Hamas. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1156.24s)]
*  And that's exactly what this rabbi is saying is okay you maybe have condemned Hamas but [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1161.92s)]
*  because you compared it to other things and said you don't just lament what Hamas did [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1166.08s)]
*  but you've lament what Israel did as well in killing innocent people, the fact that [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1170.4s)]
*  you're in some way comparing them means that I have a right to not only falsely accuse [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1175.44s)]
*  you of not having condemned Hamas but also being an anti-Semite. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1181.04s)]
*  Listen to the rest of this. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1183.92s)]
*  She refused to condemn Hamas. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1186.88s)]
*  These are your words. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1189.2s)]
*  Because when you put at the moment you say that they have a moral equivalency with anything [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1189.92s)]
*  else that's not condemnation no matter what. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1194.88s)]
*  I didn't. I said it's sad when an innocent. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1196.8s)]
*  It's not condemnation. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1199.84s)]
*  And it's not extreme. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1201.2s)]
*  Just ask me a question. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1202.0s)]
*  Is it sad? [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1202.88s)]
*  It's not extreme. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1203.68s)]
*  Sure. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1204.8s)]
*  I don't want to cut each other off okay because clearly what we are having here is just a [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1205.84s)]
*  disagreement. There's no reason to get angry. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1209.68s)]
*  Do you think it is sad when an innocent Palestinian child dies? [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1211.84s)]
*  So this is the statement of Candace Owens that caused Ben Shapira to attack her publicly [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1219.92s)]
*  on several occasions including going to a college and saying that she's a moral idiot. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1226.16s)]
*  Candace Owens said I think it's sad when any innocent child is killed. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1232.24s)]
*  She was obviously referring to Israelis and Palestinians and everybody else but because [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1237.6000000000001s)]
*  it was not a statement geared toward only condemning Hamas and to the killing of Israelis [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1243.6000000000001s)]
*  but she also instead made the mistake of recognizing that Arab and Palestinian lives have value [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1250.4s)]
*  as well including the Palestinian Christians who have been killed inside Gaza. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1257.3600000000001s)]
*  There are Palestinian Christians. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1263.2s)]
*  There are churches inside Gaza. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1264.48s)]
*  The former Michigan congressman Justin Amash who's of Palestinian descent is now running [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1266.32s)]
*  for the Republican in the Republican primary to be a senator from Michigan is of Palestinian [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1270.6399999999999s)]
*  Christian descent. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1277.9199999999998s)]
*  Part of his family were among the Palestinian Christians killed in Gaza and so she made a [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1278.6399999999999s)]
*  general statement that she thinks is lamentable when innocent life especially innocent children [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1284.1599999999999s)]
*  are killed and that somehow offended Israel supporters and this rabbi is arguing to her [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1289.28s)]
*  that that statement somehow made her an anti-Semite. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1294.48s)]
*  Candace I cry every day and it's not just for his [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1298.72s)]
*  Died. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1303.44s)]
*  Okay so she asked him do you agree with my statement that it's a tragedy when [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1303.84s)]
*  innocent children are killed and here's what he tells her in response. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1311.52s)]
*  Candace I cry every day and it's not just for Israel. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1319.2s)]
*  And this is one of the things you clearly do not understand the same when most don't [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1324.8s)]
*  who are anti-Semites you don't get it. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1330.0s)]
*  I cry for what's going on in Israel. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1331.6s)]
*  I cry just as much for what we are forced to do. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1334.32s)]
*  Golda Meyer had a great quote. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1340.48s)]
*  She said that one day we may be able to forgive them for killing Israeli children. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1343.2s)]
*  We will never be able to forgive them for making them making us kill their children. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1350.24s)]
*  So what about my statement of saying that I also cry for Palestinian children is wrong [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1358.0s)]
*  to you if you also admit it is sad when Palestinian children die. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1363.92s)]
*  It's painful but it is not in any way shape or form morally equivalent to October 7th. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1367.28s)]
*  That is the anti-Semitic victory. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1374.56s)]
*  I didn't say that I just want to be clear people are watching it's just not what came [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1376.4s)]
*  out of my mouth but I'm not going to I don't want to get hung up I don't want to get hung [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1379.84s)]
*  up on that I want to I want to now point to you said I want to talk about the depravities. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1383.1200000000001s)]
*  I want to I think the important thing in this exchange is the following. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1390.72s)]
*  Candace Owens condemned October 7th and then according to the rabbi and she denies it but [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1397.1200000000001s)]
*  let's assume it's true for the moment Candace Owens compared what Hamas did in killing [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1402.64s)]
*  Israelis on October 7th to what Israel has done in killing innocent Palestinians. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1410.16s)]
*  And maybe you don't agree with that maybe you think that Hamas when they kill Israeli citizens [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1415.76s)]
*  are moral monsters and when the Israelis kill innocent Palestinians they're angelic or [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1422.3200000000002s)]
*  benevolent or they're just doing it reluctantly. There are a lot of people who do believe that [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1427.84s)]
*  and this gold in my ear quote has always made me so sick made me sick because what it says is [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1434.48s)]
*  when we go and kill Arabs and Palestinians and kill children and women and starve them to death [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1443.28s)]
*  we're not doing that because we're deciding on our own agency to do it we're doing it because [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1452.72s)]
*  they forced us to do it and that's that gold in my ear quote oh look we'll forgive them for [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1458.0s)]
*  killing our babies but what would be much more difficult is forgiving them for forcing us to [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1464.56s)]
*  kill theirs. Now you may again disagree that there's things to compare October 7th to you [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1469.92s)]
*  really might think that for whatever reason when Hamas killed several hundred civilians and that's [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1480.16s)]
*  how many civilians were killed by Hamas inside Israel on October 7th it wasn't thousands [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1485.68s)]
*  the number was originally 1,400 of dead people they gave they lowered it to 1,200 [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1492.8s)]
*  at least four to five hundred of them are members of the military and the police you're talking [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1497.8400000000001s)]
*  about active members you're talking about 700 civilians or so and many of them were killed by [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1502.64s)]
*  the Israeli military so Hamas killed hundreds of Israeli civilians it was morally unjustifiable [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1507.84s)]
*  there were atrocities committed but I don't believe that it was something that nothing can [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1516.3999999999999s)]
*  be compared to that it was the act of singular evil but even if you do believe that it's not [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1524.08s)]
*  anti-semitic to say I condemn what Hamas did but I also lament the killing of [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1530.8s)]
*  innocent babies by Israel and Gaza as well or in the West Bank as well you may disagree with the [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1537.6s)]
*  comparison but how is that in any way shape or form anti-semitic and this is actually the problem is [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1544.08s)]
*  that what has been done in the Israel debate is that there is an imposition of obligations about [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1548.8s)]
*  how you can talk about Israel about the extent to which you can criticize it about how you're [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1557.12s)]
*  allowed to question US government policy for supporting it and if you step out of those [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1561.6799999999998s)]
*  little lines that have been drawn for you by other people like this rabbi or rabbi shmueli or bench [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1566.2399999999998s)]
*  bureau whomever you won't be debated you won't be engaged with you'll be branded a racist and you [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1570.4799999999998s)]
*  will have your job in risk of being fired of being censored as so many people have [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1578.9599999999998s)]
*  and the fact that it is the American right who has been marching under the banner of anti-cancellation [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1586.64s)]
*  and free speech and free discourse and stop calling people racist is now leading the way in doing this [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1591.52s)]
*  to Candace Owens as punishment for the fact that she has opened up some space for criticizing Israel [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1596.72s)]
*  on the American right I think is highly illustrative of what's taking place inside American conservatism [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1602.3200000000002s)]
*  where a lot of people who claim to believe in a whole wide range of values when it comes time to [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1608.16s)]
*  criticize their political opponents on the left embrace exactly those tactics in defense of Israel [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-XC3tf43A&t=1613.28s)]
