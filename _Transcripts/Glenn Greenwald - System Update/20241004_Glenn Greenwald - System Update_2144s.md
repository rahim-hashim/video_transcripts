# BREAKING "MEDIA" RULES? Asking Substantive Questions After the VP Debate
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [October 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c)
*  All right, I have to keep my voice down. I don't know why exactly I put this seems like the right thing to do. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=0.0s)]
*  Because we're in the CBS network corridors, I guess. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=12.0s)]
*  I kind of want to bust into the Drew Barrymore show set. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=18.0s)]
*  That might be more exciting than watching the vice presidential debate, which might be down that way. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=22.0s)]
*  I think that might be where the debate's happening. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=28.0s)]
*  The spin room is in here, which we were just kind of walking around there doing some interviews. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=31.0s)]
*  Help yourself to a beverage of your choice. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=37.0s)]
*  And yeah, I mean, this studio, this whole building kind of reminds me of like a high school basement or something. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=41.0s)]
*  I don't know. It's a little bit weird. But, you know, hey, we're making the most of it. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=50.0s)]
*  Why are people gathered over there? It might be. Yeah, I mean, let's go take a look. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=55.0s)]
*  I think it might be people who are photographers or stuff who are allowed to. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=61.0s)]
*  Yeah, let's not even test our luck. I don't want to even get involved. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=70.0s)]
*  I don't want to run afoul of any secret service. Yeah, that might be the. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=74.0s)]
*  What is the spray? It's like the photographers go in and take the photos. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=80.0s)]
*  OK, so there you go. Drew Barrymore show. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=85.0s)]
*  Yes, apparently this is like usually typically where the CBS sports like NFL and stuff is. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=90.0s)]
*  I don't know. I'm just going with the flow. All right. Goodbye. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=98.0s)]
*  Senator, as you know, Iran launched a salvo of missiles today at Israel. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=104.0s)]
*  Some of your colleagues, Senator Graham, have called for the U.S. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=110.0s)]
*  to support retaliatory action by Israel against Iran by perhaps bombing Iranian oil fields. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=114.0s)]
*  What would be a retaliation strike by Israel, if any, that you would support? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=119.0s)]
*  And how would you want or expect a Trump vance administration to differ with regard to Israel than the Biden administration? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=125.0s)]
*  This is actually easy. So if you look back to Trump and what would happen under Trump vance, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=131.0s)]
*  I mean, you think about this, we got no new wars when Donald Trump was president. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=136.0s)]
*  That's because he actually understood what it meant to achieve peace through strength. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=140.0s)]
*  If you look at the fact that Putin has invaded Ukraine twice, once under Obama, Biden, then under Biden, Harris, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=144.0s)]
*  then you look at what happened in the Middle East. If you look at the Middle East under Donald Trump's presidency, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=151.0s)]
*  we had the Abraham Accords. He had moved the embassy to Jerusalem. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=155.0s)]
*  We were on the pathway to not only sustainable peace, but also to growing that peace to other nations, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=159.0s)]
*  something that people thought couldn't be done. You know, and now... [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=164.0s)]
*  You want to incorporate Saudi Arabia into that framework? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=168.0s)]
*  I think Saudi Arabia is obviously a part of this conversation. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=170.0s)]
*  And if you look at what happened on October 7th, there are many people that believe that it was, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=173.0s)]
*  that they were close to actually, you know, coming into the fold there. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=177.0s)]
*  And that was one of the reasons that Hamas chose to strike. And so... [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=180.0s)]
*  Would you want the U.S. to offer security guarantees to Saudi Arabia? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=183.0s)]
*  So when you look back to your question, what they would do differently, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=186.0s)]
*  obviously they would go back to a maximum pressure strategy that they had before. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=189.0s)]
*  When we look at the sanctions underneath these two different administrations, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=193.0s)]
*  so at the very end of Trump's administration versus where we are now under the Biden-Harris administration, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=197.0s)]
*  I mean, the revenues are off the charts. I mean, we let them produce oil again. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=204.0s)]
*  We have not been enforcing sanctions like we should. We allow loopholes to continue under this administration. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=208.0s)]
*  If you go back, even the New York Times reported in the last administration that both Hezbollah and Hamas were broke. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=214.0s)]
*  And when you see that, that's what we have to do. Everything doesn't have to be militarily, military tools that you're using. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=221.0s)]
*  I mean, we've got to use the non-military tools we have to actually dry, dry Iran up financially. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=228.0s)]
*  By imposing additional sanctions on Iran? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=234.0s)]
*  Well, you don't have to do additional ones. You just have to have the will to enforce the ones that are on the books. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=236.0s)]
*  I have no idea why this administration chooses not to. They have chosen a strategy of appeasement and looked at where it's gotten us. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=241.0s)]
*  And the more money that Iran has, we know what they do with it. They use it to fund nuclear proliferation. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=248.0s)]
*  Then they use it to give Hamas, you know, they fund terrorists in Gaza there, in Hamas, Hezbollah, in Lebanon, the Houthis, in Yemen. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=253.0s)]
*  And then look at what the Houthis are doing. They are literally using our ships as target practice. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=261.0s)]
*  And guys, they have actually attacked us over 200 times. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=267.0s)]
*  This administration, which let's remember that Joe Biden said Kamala Harris has been in lockstep with him in every single decision that he has made, has used this doctrine of don't. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=271.0s)]
*  And every time they say don't, our adversaries do. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=283.0s)]
*  And so I think that this goes back to weakness from the White House. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=288.0s)]
*  And I think it's more of what we'll see if there were a Kamala Harris presidency. I think that's why it's so important to get Trump in. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=292.0s)]
*  What about in terms of a tangible retaliatory strike against Iran or not? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=298.0s)]
*  Chairman Harris, I recall you very staunchly defending Joe Biden, remaining as nominee back when there was controversy over whether he should stay in that role. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=306.0s)]
*  Do you regret so strongly standing by? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=315.0s)]
*  Why would I regret supporting the guy who's probably the most accomplished legislative president that we've had in my lifetime? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=319.0s)]
*  Because a lot of the Democratic Party decided that he was not cognitively fit to remain as president for four years. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=326.0s)]
*  That's a bunch of BS. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=331.0s)]
*  Why did they want to remove him? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=333.0s)]
*  In the end of the day, this is the situation. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=334.0s)]
*  If you take a look at Joe Biden's legislative record, compare it to anybody else. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=337.0s)]
*  Compare it to Donald Trump. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=342.0s)]
*  Did Donald Trump do anything compared to Joe Biden in terms of legislative achievements, given what he got? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=344.0s)]
*  And why did so many Democratic donors, people want to remove him? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=350.0s)]
*  Regardless of what donors wanted or whatever, they got their way, didn't they? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=353.0s)]
*  Joe Biden, in the end of the day, made a decision about what he wanted to do. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=357.0s)]
*  And he believed, probably the most selfless act in American politics ever, to have the greatest gavel of power and to give that up to the next generation to move forward. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=361.0s)]
*  Donald Trump, his vice president, who was trying to protect democracy, and he was willing to let his vice president risk his life in order to do that. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=372.0s)]
*  Selfishness versus selflessness. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=384.0s)]
*  I'm proud of Joe Biden each and every day and will always have his back. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=387.0s)]
*  So Biden had to... [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=390.0s)]
*  Sorry, my bad. Sorry. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=392.0s)]
*  So obviously there is a major development in the Middle East today. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=396.0s)]
*  Iran launched a missile salvo against Israel. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=400.0s)]
*  There have been reports that Biden administration officials like Brett McGurk, Amos Hoekstein, they were apparently privately encouraging or allowing or acquiescing to Israel to move forward. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=403.0s)]
*  They were acquiescing to Israel to launch its offensive into Lebanon, whereas publicly, Biden administration officials, Anthony Blinken, Biden himself, were urging some form of ceasefire. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=413.0s)]
*  Is there like an incongruity in the messaging around this? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=425.0s)]
*  I didn't see that information that you're sharing with me. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=428.0s)]
*  I would say that Israel was attacked by Hezbollah on October 8th, and they have had to take nearly 100,000 people away from the border because of those attacks. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=432.0s)]
*  They've got to get their people back. They have a right to respond. Hezbollah is a terrorist organization. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=443.0s)]
*  The Iranians are the biggest funders of Hezbollah, and to support their proxy now has attacked Israel, and Israel needs to defend themselves, and we're an ally of Israel, and we're going to stand with them. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=447.0s)]
*  We've gone through almost a year now of these nominal ceasefire negotiations that have never amounted to anything. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=461.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, the U.S. keeps supplying Israel with all the armaments that it requires, 2,000-pound bombs and so forth. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=467.0s)]
*  So has the Biden administration just essentially provided a blank check to Israel? Would Kamala Harris continue that? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=474.0s)]
*  No. You know, Anthony Blinken, our Secretary of State, is there repeatedly, and it's unfortunate we have not gotten to a deal that could release these hostages. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=480.0s)]
*  But you've got to remember, Hamas attacked Israel on October 7th. Israel not only has a right to defend themselves, they have an obligation to defend themselves. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=490.0s)]
*  But is that by virtue of the U.S. not using its leverage? I mean, it continues to supply the armaments for Israel to wage its military campaigns. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=498.0s)]
*  So what incentive does Israel have to comply with these ostensible ceasefire demands? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=504.0s)]
*  Well, I don't think they're ceasefire demands. Request? Request. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=509.0s)]
*  I think what we want is de-escalation. We don't need a, or want a wider conflict in the Middle East. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=513.0s)]
*  So as you know, there was a major development today in the Middle East. Iran launched a salvo of missiles at Israel. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=543.0s)]
*  Has the Biden-Harris administration exerted the kind of leverage that you would like to see to actually bring about a cessation of hostilities? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=552.0s)]
*  We've heard these calls ostensibly for a ceasefire, but the flow of armaments has continued unimpeded. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=560.0s)]
*  You voted for the national security supplemental back in April that subsidized those. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=567.0s)]
*  Has the Biden administration basically just given a blank check, whatever protestations they might give publicly about Israel's conduct? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=573.0s)]
*  Well, look, first off, President Biden and Vice President Harris have been abundantly clear that Israel has a right to defend herself. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=580.0s)]
*  I think that's an important point to make, given all of the false attacks coming from my colleagues on the other side of the aisle in so many instances. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=587.0s)]
*  And President Biden has been abundantly clear with his support of Israel while also moving forward to try to bring everyone together so that we can get to a ceasefire as well. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=596.0s)]
*  But Israel just invaded Lebanon. I mean, a ceasefire seems further away than ever, doesn't it? [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=606.0s)]
*  I never believe that a ceasefire is further away than ever before. To be clear about that, President Biden has been clear that Congress should come back. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=612.0s)]
*  And I believe that that's something that we should do, something that I support as well, not just in this space, but also with natural disasters. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=623.0s)]
*  And so Congress should be doing its job for the American people and standing strong in that space as well. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=630.0s)]
*  But I think the Biden-Harris team has been abundantly clear with how they've been working with Congress and how Congress has been working with them as well, whether it's colleagues that have been fully supportive or those that have also moved resolution or amendments from the floor. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=636.0s)]
*  In the end, we were able to pass legislation to be supportive of our allies in this effort as well. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=650.0s)]
*  Israel has a right to defend itself with all due respect. It's a bit of a cliché. I mean, it can encompass a lot of potential outcomes. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=655.0s)]
*  Israel has now invaded Lebanon. I mean, does that fall under the category of Israel having a right to defend itself? Like, what's the limiting principle there? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=661.0s)]
*  Well, when you look at what happened before with more rockets being thrown into Israel and now we're seeing the same attacks coming with ballistic missiles as well from Iran, Israel is defending herself. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=669.0s)]
*  Would you be in favor of Israel with US backing taking some kind of retaliatory action against Iran directly, like Senator Ramsuday called for Israel to bomb Iranian oil fields? Is that within realm of possibility something you support? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=684.0s)]
*  The Biden administration has been abundantly clear through national spokesperson from the military perspective, as well as Drake Sullivan associated with being supportive of taking on all terrorists, including those that are being sponsored by Iran and especially holding Iran accountable. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=697.0s)]
*  That's always been the case, and that has not changed. That's never changed in President Biden's advocacy from when he was first a United States senator all the way through him serving as president of the United States. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=717.0s)]
*  Well, one final question on the issue of Ukraine. Like I said, you did vote for that national security supplemental bill back in April that funded Israel and Ukraine. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=726.0s)]
*  Israel, Ukraine rather has been arguing for permission to use US munitions to strike even longer range targets inside Russian territory. Again, is there any limiting principle there? Is there ever like an escalatory risk that you would find intolerable in terms of what the US should authorize Ukraine to do, especially with Russia being the largest nuclear armed state in the world? [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=737.0s)]
*  The United States has been abundantly clear with the support that we have been working on and towards, and that has already been sent to the president of the United States of how US weapons will be used. And the US continues to be in that posture as well. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=762.0s)]
*  We'll see what President Biden and others bring to us with the Joint Chiefs. But as of right now, that's been the path forward of where the United States is with the support that we've included in the legislation and language in the legislation about use of weapons to defend Ukraine and to make sure that we stand up against Russia. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=777.0s)]
*  Would you expect Kamala Harris to basically just continue the foreign policy status quo that we've seen under the Biden administration or are there like significant policy distinctions that you can discern between Kamala Harris and Joe Biden? [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=794.0s)]
*  Vice President Harris has been abundantly clear about her policies as well, and she is her own leader as well, which I very much appreciate in having had a chance to work with her. So that's a question you may want to ask the vice president herself. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=806.0s)]
*  I would love to. Do you have her contact information? [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=817.0s)]
*  You might. You've been on the road. You might be able to. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=820.0s)]
*  All right. I'll try to do so. Thanks, Senator. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=822.0s)]
*  Take care. Good to meet you. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=824.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=825.0s)]
*  Mr. Lutnick. Lutnick. Sorry. Thank you for the pronunciation correction. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=830.0s)]
*  Yeah, Howard Lutnick, Cantor Fitzgerald. I knew that. I recognized you without even having to look it up. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=834.0s)]
*  So you're the co-chair of the Trump transition team, is that right? [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=839.0s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=843.0s)]
*  So in the first Trump administration, a lot of lobbyists got appointed to prominent cabinet positions. Mark Esper, defense secretary, for example, was the top lobbyist. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=844.0s)]
*  Raytheon, lots of other examples. Is that a philosophy that you would want to see perpetuated in a second Trump administration? Would it differ? [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=854.0s)]
*  What's the status of that? [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=862.0s)]
*  No lobbyists are part of the transition. So I don't think so at all. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=864.0s)]
*  I think we have the greatest group of potential people who want to serve that you've ever seen. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=870.0s)]
*  We have the leaders of America from technology, pharmaceuticals, business, defense. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=877.0s)]
*  They're all willing to both willing to serve. You saw Elon Musk is willing, right, willing to try to help and take a cabinet position. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=885.0s)]
*  No, I think he'll be an adviser. Right. And he's going to help build technology because he wants the efficiency of the US government. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=893.0s)]
*  You've got amazing people trying to help and they're all focused on it. And so we will have the greatest administration you've ever seen. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=900.0s)]
*  And it's really been so much fun, shockingly fun, because everybody wants to help. And there's just no friction. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=908.0s)]
*  So no lobbyists in a second Trump administration? [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=916.0s)]
*  I would not expect people who are lobbyists to be a material part. You can't say none. It's 4,000 people joining. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=919.0s)]
*  Senior level cabinet positions, let's say. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=928.0s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=931.0s)]
*  And is that a concerted decision that was made somewhere along the way to sort of break from what the approach was in the first administration? [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=933.0s)]
*  I think we with respect to transition, no one associated and as part of the transition is a lobbyist. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=941.0s)]
*  We don't have lobbyists as part of the transition. Lobbyists can, of course, suggest quality people. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=947.0s)]
*  I'm happy to have that. But we don't have lobbyists as part of the group bringing or a part of the transition. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=952.0s)]
*  They're just not a part of the transition. So we're seeking the best people in the world. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=958.0s)]
*  It doesn't mean that lobbyists aren't the best people, but I think we've been focused. There's been no focus of it. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=963.0s)]
*  So I wouldn't even know if there were any because it's been so small and so rare that it's I just don't think it's going to be material at all. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=968.0s)]
*  So your fellow co-chair is Linda McMahon, correct? [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=977.0s)]
*  Is she still the CEO of the WWE? I'm not sure. She was at some point, right? [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=982.0s)]
*  She was the head of the Small Business Administration, the first Trump administration. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=987.0s)]
*  And now she was also the chair of this America First Policy Institute. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=991.0s)]
*  It's basically like an administration and waiting for a second Trump term. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=995.0s)]
*  Right. So is it basically does her being your co-chair indicate that there's a lot of sway in terms of personnel for a second administration in terms of the think tank world, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=998.0s)]
*  which is what she's been involved in these past couple of years? [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1008.0s)]
*  So Linda and I have split the role of transition. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1011.0s)]
*  So she's in charge since she runs the American First Policy Institute. She's in charge of policy. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1016.0s)]
*  So her group is really writing up a you know, the objectives for each person who comes in the government. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1022.0s)]
*  What are their objectives for six months, 12 months and 18 months? [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1029.0s)]
*  I'm going to think about so that everybody's rowing their oars in the same direction. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1034.0s)]
*  That's policy. And then my side is personnel. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1037.0s)]
*  Go find the greatest talented athletes to take the field that we possibly can and use our connections. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1040.0s)]
*  The Republican Party. I mean, you got 80 million people going to vote. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1046.0s)]
*  The ability to find incredibly talented people is actually much, much easier than you think. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1049.0s)]
*  It's amazing. Donald Trump gets to be a second term president, but he gets a full transition. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1054.0s)]
*  Everybody knows this is going to be the most exciting four years. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1061.0s)]
*  And you know, you've got just such pull of people who want to serve. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1066.0s)]
*  It's been it's been so much fun. And Linda and I have a perfect split. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1070.0s)]
*  She's in charge of policy because she runs the American First Policy Institute. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1074.0s)]
*  And I rebuilt Canada Fitzgerald after 9-11. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1078.0s)]
*  And I learned that a higher 5000 people in 15 months. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1080.0s)]
*  And so we are running the best HR for Donald Trump and JD Vane. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1084.0s)]
*  Give us a sense of what your prognosis is in the national security and defense sphere in terms of personnel, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1090.0s)]
*  maybe also policy insofar as you can convey what Linda McMahon has been been up to. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1097.0s)]
*  Is it still going to be emphasis on increasing defense spending elements? [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1103.0s)]
*  The Republican Party are skeptical of what they call the military industrial complex in a disparaging way. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1110.0s)]
*  Other elements of the party may be more favorable toward that. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1115.0s)]
*  How is that tension being navigated? If it is in your in your work thus far. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1119.0s)]
*  So we bring in talent. Right. So talent. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1125.0s)]
*  So how does it go? People with deep, deep national security experience, people with deep, deep defense experience. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1128.0s)]
*  Give us an example. No, why not? [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1135.0s)]
*  Because that's not the way it works. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1138.0s)]
*  The way it works is I build basically the way I say it is a mosaic of talent. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1140.0s)]
*  And the president of the United States is going to choose from that mosaic of talent. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1146.0s)]
*  So that that's my job. But you think about it, we have technology, huge focus on the capacity to improve the technology of the U.S. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1150.0s)]
*  People who have vast experience across across his first administration in business, the prior administrations. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1158.0s)]
*  I mean, they're all coming. Is Jared Kushner coming back? [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1166.0s)]
*  I don't comment on people. I told you that's not it. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1169.0s)]
*  But Jared Kushner is big help to me. The people he's actively helping you on this project is absolutely actively helping me because everybody's helping me. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1172.0s)]
*  J.D. Vance is helping me. Everybody's helping find the most talented people they have. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1182.0s)]
*  And they are recommending them to serve in the government. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1187.0s)]
*  How about this? Everybody who serves in the Trump government will have been vouched for by some world class, talented person who says this person we have confidence in will do a great job in the government. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1191.0s)]
*  And that is just it'll be amazing. And that's why it's so fun. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1203.0s)]
*  When did you first meet Donald Trump? [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1207.0s)]
*  I think I met Donald Trump 35 years ago. Maybe it's been a while. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1210.0s)]
*  In New York circles or? [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1214.0s)]
*  Correct. In the charity circles. You know, when I when I was a young man going to the charity parties, I would go to these charity parties all the time. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1217.0s)]
*  And he was going to the charity parties all the time. So I've met him, you know, decades and decades ago. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1223.0s)]
*  All right. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1228.0s)]
*  My pleasure. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1230.0s)]
*  So Donald Trump has been saying that if he regains the presidency, one of his priorities is going to be to crack down on anti-Semitism, including by using the coercive power of the state to somehow [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1234.0s)]
*  require colleges and universities that receive public funding to eliminate what he calls anti-Semitic speech. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1245.0s)]
*  You know, as a Jew yourself, I mean, do you find that to be something that's needed in this climate? [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1253.0s)]
*  And what First Amendment concerns would you or would you have or not have about that? [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1260.0s)]
*  Like many things, the former president says, you know, it's unclear what the actual policy proposal is. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1266.0s)]
*  I'm excited as a Jewish American by the prospect of electing first gentleman Doug Emhoff, along with Kamala Harris. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1272.0s)]
*  Is Doug on the ballot? I didn't realize. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1279.0s)]
*  Be the first Jewish American in the White House, which is very exciting. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1281.0s)]
*  There's never been a Jewish American family in the White House. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1285.0s)]
*  And that's exciting. Of course, Kamala Harris has a long track record of supporting the Jewish community, supporting Israel. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1289.0s)]
*  And I'm confident that she'll be able to help bridge this divide across our college campuses and rein in the rampant anti-Semitism that exists in some universities. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1296.0s)]
*  Have you observed what you would call or characterize as rampant anti-Semitism in any Colorado universities? [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1305.0s)]
*  I think we've been better than most in that, again, we've made a deliberate effort to make sure all of our students feel safe, Jewish, Muslim, regardless of their opinions on conflicts in the Middle East. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1312.0s)]
*  And I think if you ask most Colorado students, they'd appreciate the efforts that we've made as a state, that our universities, University of Colorado, Colorado State University have made to help make sure that our universities are safe and civil learning environments for all students. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1322.0s)]
*  How have you navigated speech versus harm done to Jewish students in the sense that, you know, some people will claim that even the phrase like from the river to the sea is inherently anti-Semitic because it's a claim that's calling for the destruction of Israel and that. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1335.0s)]
*  Therefore inflicts harm on students, but it is really it is ultimately a form of speech. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1351.0s)]
*  Right. It really crosses the line where students are intimidated, are physically threatened, are deterred from being able to attend their gathering places or classes or lunches. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1356.0s)]
*  And when that occurs, there needs to be an intervention from the university to make sure that all students can feel safe and respected on their campus. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1366.0s)]
*  And has the have those sorts of interventions been required on your part over the past year? [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1374.0s)]
*  I can't follow every campus in the United States. I can say in Colorado, I'm proud of the job we've done in setting the tone, preventing disruptions from classes and making sure the students feel safe at our campuses. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1378.0s)]
*  So this is not squarely within your remit as the governor of Colorado, but you were in Congress previously and take an interest in foreign policy issues. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1388.0s)]
*  There was and it does have some downstream ramifications in terms of the political climate. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1397.0s)]
*  So there was the Iranian strike on Israel today. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1402.0s)]
*  The Biden administration says that it's calling for a ceasefire. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1407.0s)]
*  And yet it seems to have given at least implicit authorization for Israel to launch an invasion of Lebanon. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1411.0s)]
*  Do you have any hope that any of this turmoil could be reined at any time soon? [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1418.0s)]
*  Are we just kind of in for constant conflagration in the Middle East? [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1423.0s)]
*  Well, you know, sometimes it's darkest, you know, before the end of the storm. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1427.0s)]
*  And I think we should always remain in that American spirit, optimistic and hopeful that we can bring people together to create a lasting and just peace in the Middle East. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1431.0s)]
*  One final question for you. So you had a libertarian streak or you've known for at least being hospitable to some libertarian ideals or concepts, at least for a Democrat. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1440.0s)]
*  Kamala Harris back in August said that she was going to be proposing some form of price controls. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1451.0s)]
*  It's been a little vague what specifically she's been proposing. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1457.0s)]
*  But somebody who at least is reputed to have this kind of libertarian inclination. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1461.0s)]
*  Did that give you any pause? Kamala Harris has not proposed any kind of price controls. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1466.0s)]
*  What's been mischaracterized is that is making sure we can price gouging. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1470.0s)]
*  She's against antitrust investigations into illegal price gouging. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1474.0s)]
*  Absolutely. She's not brought forward and does not support any kind of price controls. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1478.0s)]
*  And I would contrast that with Donald Trump's across the board 20 percent tariffs, which would increase costs for American consumers and restrict free trade. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1483.0s)]
*  All right. Thanks, Governor. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1491.0s)]
*  So tonight, the very first exchange was about Israel and obviously the events of today with Iran firing the salvo of missiles into Israel. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1495.0s)]
*  J.D. Vance says some of the effect of look, Israel should be able to do whatever it decides is correct. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1504.0s)]
*  But wouldn't the U.S. inevitably be involved in whatever military operation Israel might undertake against Iran, [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1510.0s)]
*  whether it's supplying armaments or the intelligence or diplomatic backing? [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1517.0s)]
*  Doesn't the U.S. have a role in weighing in on whether it might be worth entangling the U.S. in some kind of retaliatory strike against Iran? [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1522.0s)]
*  Well, J.D. Vance was correct in to say that Israel has the right to defend itself. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1531.0s)]
*  Israel has been under attack. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1535.0s)]
*  Its very existence has been under attack by Iran directly in the unprecedented hypersonic ballistic missiles that were launched from Iranian soil to Israel today. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1537.0s)]
*  And it has been under attack through Iranian proxies Hamas and Hezbollah. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1546.0s)]
*  Of course, U.S. resources when it comes to our critical military aid to Israel, when it comes to our funding for Iron Dome, that is of overwhelming support, including from J.D. Vance. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1551.0s)]
*  And most importantly, President Trump. But we voted to pass that. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1560.0s)]
*  But the reality is it's the Biden administration, Kamala Harris, who not only slow walked that military aid, [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1563.0s)]
*  but have been turning their backs at every opportunity demanding a ceasefire and not wanting to allow Israel to defend itself. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1569.0s)]
*  I believe Israel should defend itself. And certainly those are the policies of President Trump. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1577.0s)]
*  Hasn't the Biden-Harris administration supplied more military resources to Israel than any administration ever? [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1581.0s)]
*  The United States Congress forced that through. Joe Biden slow walked it. Kamala Harris slow walked it. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1588.0s)]
*  So it's because of the leadership of the United States Congress. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1594.0s)]
*  Don't forget there were multiple veto threats that were issued by Joe Biden when we passed the Israel military aid. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1596.0s)]
*  Not once, not twice, two veto threats. And it was only when it was combined in a package of other priorities for the Biden administration. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1602.0s)]
*  So no, at every opportunity they have blocked critical military aid to Israel at the most significant time of need. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1609.0s)]
*  So would you like to see, what you would want to see from a future Trump administration is to remove even the minimal constraints [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1616.0s)]
*  that the Biden administration has placed on Israel and its conduct of its military campaigns against Hezbollah, against Hamas, potentially against Iran. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1624.0s)]
*  Do we want fewer constraints imposed on Israel? Is that what you'd like to see? [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1633.0s)]
*  I want to return to the effective peace through strength policies of President Trump that brought peace to the Middle East, [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1637.0s)]
*  whether it was the historic breakthrough of the Abraham Accords. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1642.0s)]
*  I also want to see a return to the maximum pressure campaign against Iran, which has been wiped away by Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1645.0s)]
*  turning over $100 billion to Iran in sanctions relief that directly go to fund Hezbollah and Hamas and the very hypersonic ballistic missiles that are firing into Israel. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1652.0s)]
*  The maximum pressure campaign was working under President Trump. That's why the Iranian regime was at its knees economically. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1663.0s)]
*  And they've been on the rise because of Joe Biden's obsession with appeasement of the Iranian regime. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1670.0s)]
*  So the American people, what's most important on the debate night is they can compare where we are today around the world and our national security [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1676.0s)]
*  versus where we were under President Trump, which was peace in the Middle East, historic breakthroughs, normalization between Israel and Arab countries, [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1683.0s)]
*  as well as steadfast support for our most precious ally in the region. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1691.0s)]
*  So is the end state of this maximum pressure campaign ultimately to inflict regime change on Iran? [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1695.0s)]
*  The end state is deterrence to ensure that Israel and there is stability in the Middle East. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1701.0s)]
*  It is deterrence and it was an effective deterrence strategy under President Trump where you did not see Hamas attacks like October 7 happen under President Trump's watch, [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1707.0s)]
*  just like you did not see a catastrophic withdrawal from Afghanistan with 13 service members lives lost under Joe Biden. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1717.0s)]
*  You didn't see that under President Trump. And just like you did not see Putin invade any other country under President Trump. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1725.0s)]
*  And JD Vance hit a very important point this evening said the only president who hasn't started and gotten entangled in terms of the U.S. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1730.0s)]
*  in a war in our lifetime and around the same age as JD is Donald J. Trump. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1738.0s)]
*  That is a huge, huge accomplishment. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1743.0s)]
*  Congresswoman, Governor Walz started out tonight by repeating this refrain that Israel has a right to defend itself. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1751.0s)]
*  Israel has just invaded Lebanon. Israel is now intimating that it could attack Iran. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1758.0s)]
*  So shouldn't we be looking for a little more than just these platitudes about Israel having a right to defend itself? [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1766.0s)]
*  What is the limiting principle, especially when the U.S. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1773.0s)]
*  the one providing the armaments for Israel to wage these military campaigns, as you know, having voted for the National Security Supplemental back in April, which underwrote Israel's war effort? [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1776.0s)]
*  Absolutely, I voted for it. I voted for that along with every other supplemental that was available. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1786.0s)]
*  And I will tell you this, it is important that people understand what diplomacy looks like. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1791.0s)]
*  And it looks like the fact that this relationship between Israel and the United States has existed since before I was born. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1795.0s)]
*  And guess what? This relationship will continue on in perpetuity even after I'm gone. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1802.0s)]
*  And so when you look at Israel, I think it is important that people start to talk about the fact that the state of Israel versus their leadership. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1807.0s)]
*  Because right now, or when I went to Israel, I know that the people were protesting Netanyahu because Netanyahu was reforming the courts. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1817.0s)]
*  In addition to the fact that Netanyahu was under investigation along with people in his administration. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1826.0s)]
*  Sound familiar? Does it sound like somebody else that you know? [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1832.0s)]
*  It sounds like Donald Trump to me, somebody that has reformed our courts, courts that have decided that he now has a level of immunity that he should not be entitled to based on our laws, [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1835.0s)]
*  as well as somebody who is under criminal indictments, as well as somebody who has criminal convictions. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1845.0s)]
*  And so different people do their votes for different reasons. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1850.0s)]
*  But for me, when I'm looking forward and I'm trying to figure out what is going to happen, if for some reason, let's say we say, well, you know what? [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1854.0s)]
*  You had your Democratic election and we just don't like your leader. So we will leave you. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1863.0s)]
*  Will that give permission to our allies to leave us if, God forbid, Donald Trump come back into power and then they leave us? [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1868.0s)]
*  And then that leaves us more insecure. So, I mean, everybody has their reasons for why they do stuff. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1877.0s)]
*  But I will also tell you this, because the issue today has to do with the fact that Iran ended up firing missiles over into Israel. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1882.0s)]
*  After Israel invaded Lebanon. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1892.0s)]
*  But is Iran Lebanon? [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1894.0s)]
*  No. But this thing is a spiraling catastrophe that the Biden administration has nothing to rein in. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1896.0s)]
*  Let's be clear. When the attacks, which I will say everything that happened in Lebanon or the initial attacks, [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1902.0s)]
*  at least that was more calculated and it was more it was it was specifically intended for who? [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1910.0s)]
*  For terrorists, correct? I mean, you got to clarify what you're saying. I don't follow. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1918.0s)]
*  Hezbollah. So Israel was attacking Hezbollah, correct? [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1924.0s)]
*  Well, they've done a ground invasion into Lebanon now. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1929.0s)]
*  They have now done one. But to be clear, they were attacking Hezbollah, who is a terrorist organization, correct? [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1931.0s)]
*  They've invaded the entire country. They bombed Beirut. They've bombed the country. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1938.0s)]
*  So you think everybody who's been killed in the Israeli bombardments has been Hezbollah? [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1944.0s)]
*  OK, that what I am saying is that at least when Lebanon we talked about what they had the pagers, correct? [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1949.0s)]
*  Right. And so they were literally more calculated in trying not to do those pages blew up in grocery stores and a little girl was killed. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1960.0s)]
*  I understand. And I'm not disagreeing with that. And I want to be clear. No one should ever be OK with war. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1969.0s)]
*  You voted to fund it. No, I did not vote to fund war. What I voted for. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1975.0s)]
*  Yes, you did. You voted to supply Israel with armaments that they're using in their prosecution of the war. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1980.0s)]
*  Do you understand that we took more than one vote? Let me ask you, since you know about it. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1985.0s)]
*  I know all about it. I follow very closely. Tell me about the rest of my vote. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1989.0s)]
*  On the national security supplemental? Can you tell me about all the votes that we had? [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1992.0s)]
*  Yeah, you voted for Ukraine, for the Indo-Pacific, for. Because we had three votes on Israel. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=1996.0s)]
*  There have been like a million votes on Israel. We had three votes. Let me let me clarify. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=2002.0s)]
*  We have three votes as relates to funding for Israel. So let me make sure that your record is very clear. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=2007.0s)]
*  The very first vote was to fund Israel and defund the IRS because that's what the Republicans put on the floor. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=2012.0s)]
*  That because the correct house. OK, what was my vote? It was a no. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=2019.0s)]
*  No, then we ultimately voted yes on the bill to fund Israel. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=2024.0s)]
*  The second vote was to fund Israel and no other funding. OK, the third vote. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=2027.0s)]
*  Was it just for funding Israel or was it also to get money to the people of Gaza? [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=2034.0s)]
*  Which? Yeah, which? And and and that aid has been consistently blocked. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=2038.0s)]
*  I mean, you can complain about Netanyahu, but he's the one administering the funding that you said. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=2045.0s)]
*  This is about the debate. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=2050.0s)]
*  Do you feel like he was an effective messenger tonight? I do. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=2054.0s)]
*  I think he was I think he was there to deliver on policy. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=2058.0s)]
*  It's one of the things that people complained about in the first debate is that they weren't able to get a lot of. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=2061.0s)]
*  I guess we're going to. Make sure you get your debate question and much more relevant. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=2068.0s)]
*  I am. You interrupted me. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=2077.0s)]
*  About a foreign policy issue, what you object to that. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=2084.0s)]
*  I also have questions I want to ask. All right, I'm sure they'll be fascinating. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=2087.0s)]
*  So here's the standard question that journalists ask of these things, and they get really offended if we ask about foreign policy. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=2091.0s)]
*  I even did the requisite hook to the debate by asking about walls is comments on Israel, but that wasn't good enough for that idiot. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=2097.0s)]
*  Who was really offended that we were occupying the congresswoman's time by asking about her votes on national security, supplemental funding, et cetera. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=2106.0s)]
*  But here's what they ask. Excuse me, Congresswoman, the governor walls do what he had to do tonight to win over the voters. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=2115.0s)]
*  I mean, they'll ask the most banal, generic, uninformative questions and then throw a hissy fit when I saunter in and actually ask something a bit more substantive. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=2123.0s)]
*  So I hope you enjoyed that little example there of how the media functions. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH4qTQDcC5c&t=2134.0s)]
