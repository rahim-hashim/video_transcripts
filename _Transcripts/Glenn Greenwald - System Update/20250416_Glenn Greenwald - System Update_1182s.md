# Could Trump Deport U.S. CITIZENS?!
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [April 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg)
*  All right. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=0.0s)]
*  So probably a lot of you have seen this meeting between the American president and the El [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=7.08s)]
*  Salvadoran president. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=12.4s)]
*  Obviously El Salvador is a small country. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=14.72s)]
*  The US had been at war with it, had been involved in dirty wars there throughout the 1980s. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=16.92s)]
*  It is generally considered an underdeveloped country and still is, but President Bukele [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=22.0s)]
*  a lot of global attention in part because the government under him just rounded up thousands [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=27.48s)]
*  and thousands of people who were not convicted of crimes, but were quote unquote suspects [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=33.480000000000004s)]
*  in gang violence. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=39.0s)]
*  No question. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=40.68s)]
*  A lot of them have been swept up who are innocent, many of them guilty, and they're put into [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=41.68s)]
*  not ordinary prisons, but prisons that are some of the cruelest, most dehumanizing and [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=46.6s)]
*  exploitative in the world. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=51.52s)]
*  They're purposely meant to dehumanize. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=53.44s)]
*  Bukele talks openly about how the fact that the prisons pay for themselves because they [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=55.96s)]
*  force the prisoners to basically engage in slave labor. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=59.800000000000004s)]
*  They love to take videos and photos and make all kinds of films showing the dehumanization [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=62.6s)]
*  process and rights have been run roughshod over in El Salvador. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=68.76s)]
*  There's no free speech. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=72.76s)]
*  You can't criticize Bukele. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=74.26s)]
*  If you're a journalist, you get attacked by the government. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=75.56s)]
*  If you do so, there's certainly no rights of due process. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=77.4s)]
*  People who go into this prison are meant to stay there for life. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=81.48s)]
*  There's violence in this prison, not from the prisoners, but from the guards. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=84.72s)]
*  Many of them actually have died. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=88.64s)]
*  It's basically a place that you're intended never to leave. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=90.64s)]
*  A lot of people in El Salvador, as often happens with authoritarianism, love their leader. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=94.4s)]
*  They love their authoritarian leader because it has had results. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=99.6s)]
*  It has significantly lowered crime in a place once plagued by a lot of violence. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=102.9s)]
*  It has now become significantly safer. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=106.92s)]
*  In general, though, we in the United States, our founding values, our constitution, the [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=110.48s)]
*  founding as based in the values of the Enlightenment, don't believe that we should sacrifice rights [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=115.28s)]
*  for safety. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=121.56s)]
*  The whole constitution, in fact, is intended to elevate the rights of people, even if it [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=122.74000000000001s)]
*  means impeding our ability to catch criminals. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=129.32s)]
*  The founders understood because they were waging a war against the British Crown that [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=132.92000000000002s)]
*  all the rights of the British Crown routinely invaded in the name of stopping crime, invading [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=137.60000000000002s)]
*  people's homes with no search warrant, just rushing them through a trial with no rights [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=141.16s)]
*  if they thought they were guilty. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=145.36s)]
*  Those were the things that had to be avoided if America was really going to be free and [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=146.56s)]
*  democratic. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=150.26000000000002s)]
*  These are the things in the constitution that you can go and read, none of which at this [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=151.26000000000002s)]
*  point is available in El Salvador. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=154.52s)]
*  There is a little bit of an oddity that the person most responsible for this authoritarianism, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=157.96s)]
*  you can even call it tyranny in El Salvador, although with positive results that many of [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=164.16s)]
*  the people in El Salvador seem to like. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=168.64s)]
*  Again, it's not uncommon for people to love their authoritarian leader. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=171.32s)]
*  People crave security, crave protection if you promise them that in exchange for something [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=175.07999999999998s)]
*  they fear. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=180.32s)]
*  They'd be happy to give up rights. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=181.32s)]
*  We've seen that in American history. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=183.16s)]
*  That's what the war on terror was. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=184.44s)]
*  It's what all sorts of wars in the United States have entailed, including the Cold War. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=186.35999999999999s)]
*  It's a very common formula that the American founders set out most to avoid. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=193.04s)]
*  It's a little strange, to put that mildly, to see a political faction, what do you call [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=197.12s)]
*  it, MAGA movement or nationalists, whose primary objective or aspiration is to preserve American [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=202.23999999999998s)]
*  values, venerating basically a tin pot dictator at this point of a small Central American [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=212.0s)]
*  country as someone who is not just a close ally of the United States, who we pay to imprison [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=219.76000000000002s)]
*  people even though they've never been convicted of crimes. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=226.48000000000002s)]
*  We just send them there when their only crime is having entered the United States illegally, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=229.12s)]
*  although some people have been sent there who haven't entered illegally, who are in [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=233.04000000000002s)]
*  the United States legally seeking asylum, who came through a legal port on the border, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=237.36s)]
*  the port of entry, as people are told to do. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=242.8s)]
*  But in any event, it's not just that we're allied with him, but a lot of people seem [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=245.6s)]
*  to really admire Bukele, almost suggesting that we in the United States need to use him [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=250.08s)]
*  as a model, to use El Salvador as a model for how our own country should be in part to [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=255.60000000000002s)]
*  fight crime, in part to fight the obvious problem that most people agree is a real problem of people [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=260.08s)]
*  pouring into the country illegally. So the question becomes how much liberty are we going [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=267.12s)]
*  to sacrifice? How many constitutional rights are we going to repudiate in the name of these other [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=272.4s)]
*  goals, whether we have to fight crime as though crime is rampant, more so than usual, or because [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=278.56s)]
*  of the problem of people in the country illegally. Now, the laws of the United States make it very [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=285.28s)]
*  easy to deport someone who's in the United States illegally. You don't even have to go [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=291.67999999999995s)]
*  to a real court. You just issue a removal order. You go to a special deportation court that's not [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=295.12s)]
*  even part of the Article 3 judiciary. It's just inside the Department of Justice. I think just [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=301.6s)]
*  rubber-stamp it. All they want to know is, is the person in the United States here legally? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=307.04s)]
*  And if the person can't show they are, and it's very easy. It's just, here's my green card. Here's [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=310.8s)]
*  my visa. If they don't have that, it means they've entered the country illegally. The court approves [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=315.04s)]
*  their deportation. But deportation means sending them back to their country of origin. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=319.84000000000003s)]
*  And what has been so controversial is not that President Trump ran three times on a pledge of [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=325.76s)]
*  sending people in the country illegally to deport them back to their country of origin. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=333.12s)]
*  People voted for him in the last election based on that promise of mass deportations. Polls show [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=337.76s)]
*  that's what people want. That is not the issue. There are people, I'm sure, so I don't want to say [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=344.56s)]
*  nobody, but most people involved in these debates have no problem with legal deportation of people [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=350.08s)]
*  in the country illegally. That's what Trump pledged to do. He had a democratic mandate for that. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=356.0s)]
*  Polls show that's what people want. That's not the issue. What's happening is much, much different. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=360.72s)]
*  And we covered this before, that people aren't being sent back to their country of origin. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=365.84s)]
*  They're being sent to El Salvador, a country they've never been to. They have nothing to do [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=370.72s)]
*  with. They're not citizens of, never have been. And they're not just being sent there. They're [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=373.84s)]
*  being imprisoned in one of the worst prisons on the planet while the United States pays for their [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=377.44s)]
*  imprisonment. And they're being imprisoned for life based on allegations of criminal activity. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=383.92s)]
*  Oh, you're a member of Tren de Agua or some other violent gang. No due process at all for that [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=390.4s)]
*  allegation. We're imprisoning people for life. We're paying for their imprisonment in a foreign [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=397.2s)]
*  country based on accusations that are never proven. And all of this, we've covered this before, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=400.8s)]
*  but all of this became severely escalated this week when President Trump, both in his meeting [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=406.08s)]
*  with President Bukele, as well as to the White House press corps that then gathered, as well as [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=410.32s)]
*  in subsequent interviews, said that he doesn't just want to send people in the country illegally [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=415.12s)]
*  to El Salvador. He also wants to send American citizens who have been convicted of violent crimes [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=422.56s)]
*  to El Salvador as well. Take American citizens, deport them to El Salvador to disappear in this [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=429.68s)]
*  prison. That's one of the worst human rights abuses of the world. And that President Bukele [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=434.96s)]
*  himself says is designed to make sure nobody really ever gets out of. And that is a radical [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=441.44s)]
*  theory when you're talking about deporting American citizens. American citizens cannot be deported. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=447.28s)]
*  There's never been any kind of principle that suggests that that can happen, let alone sent to [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=450.96s)]
*  a foreign prison, not on American soil, meaning you don't have access to your family. You don't [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=455.84s)]
*  access to your lawyers. You don't have access to American courts if your human rights are [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=461.28s)]
*  being violated. These are all rights of American citizenship guaranteed by the Constitution, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=465.35999999999996s)]
*  all of which would be denied if President Trump's proposal went forward. Now, as I said, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=469.76s)]
*  President Trump often says things that he doesn't really mean. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=474.08s)]
*  And that's why I personally don't believe in becoming hysterical every time he opens his mouth [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=478.64s)]
*  and says something, because a lot of it is intentionally provocative or designed to achieve [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=484.0s)]
*  some other goal. But when you're talking about in the context of a lot of already radical proposals, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=487.92s)]
*  like sending people in the country to El Salvador to be imprisoned for life with no due process, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=493.68s)]
*  even sending people there when there's a nine to zero Supreme Court order saying you have to [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=499.76s)]
*  get them back and refusing to do so, meaning nine to zero. All the judges on the Supreme Court, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=503.84000000000003s)]
*  the American right, the Trump movement loves, like Justice Thomas, Justice Alito, Justice Gorsuch, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=508.56s)]
*  three of them Trump appointees on the court, all nine of them unanimously said you have to facilitate [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=515.2s)]
*  the return of this one person who was in the country illegally, but a deportation court ordered [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=521.2s)]
*  not be removed pending further processes. Trump administration itself admits they did it by [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=530.24s)]
*  accident. It was a bureaucratic error. But now they and Bukele are saying, nothing we can do. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=536.4s)]
*  We're not going to try and get him back to the U.S. Even though there was a deportation hold on [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=541.12s)]
*  him from a real court, followed by a nine to zero ruling from the Supreme Court that they have to do [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=545.12s)]
*  everything they can to facilitate his return. But let me start with this proposal about citizens, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=549.6s)]
*  American citizens being sent to El Salvador is something Trump said repeatedly throughout this [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=555.84s)]
*  week. And I don't think he was kidding. Whether he's kidding or not, it still deserves comment, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=561.52s)]
*  not hysteria, but commentary. Here was the first time Trump said it when he was, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=566.08s)]
*  this was, I believe, Fox News covering the Oval Office meeting. He's made it a very safe place. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=573.9200000000001s)]
*  People go and they feel very secure and safe. He's also built one, but other also prisons, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=579.5200000000001s)]
*  very big ones that we're using his system because we're getting rid of our criminals from out of the [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=586.08s)]
*  United States. So we're allowed to come in by Biden. We're getting them out. And the president [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=592.4s)]
*  is helping us with that President Bukele. So I was very impressed with them. Really very impressed. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=598.0s)]
*  Could we use it for violent criminals, our own violent criminals? [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=604.88s)]
*  I call them homegrown criminals. I mean, the homegrown ones, the ones that grew up and something [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=609.04s)]
*  went wrong and they hit people over the head with a baseball bat. We have and push people into [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=614.16s)]
*  subways just before the train gets there, like you see happening sometimes. We are looking into [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=620.08s)]
*  it and we want to do it. I would love to do that. So there's time at homegrown citizens, people who [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=626.4000000000001s)]
*  were born in the United States, grew up in the United States. And if it wasn't clear, he made [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=634.4000000000001s)]
*  explicitly clear when asked other times that he means American citizens. First of all, here is [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=638.32s)]
*  is him being asked in the Oval Office whether American citizen could be deported to El Salvador. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=643.36s)]
*  Do you mention that you're open to deporting individuals that aren't foreign aliens but are [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=652.0s)]
*  criminals to El Salvador? Does that include potentially US citizens fully naturalizing? [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=656.88s)]
*  If they're criminals and if they hit people with baseball bats over their head that happen to be [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=663.36s)]
*  90 years old. And if they rape 87 year old women in Coney Island, Brooklyn, yeah, yeah, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=667.84s)]
*  that includes them. Why do you think there's special category of person? They're as bad as anybody [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=677.2s)]
*  that comes in. I mean, that should be a shocking comment. Yes, American citizens are actually a [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=682.24s)]
*  special category in the United States. The reality is, and the Supreme Court has ruled this over and [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=691.44s)]
*  over, including just two weeks ago by a nine zero ruling, that everybody in the United States, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=697.68s)]
*  not just citizens, even people here legally in the US, have a right to due process before they're [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=703.12s)]
*  sent to prisons to have a court review whether the allegations against them are valid, are [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=708.8s)]
*  sustainable by evidence. But American citizens, nobody disputes that American citizens have all [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=717.3599999999999s)]
*  the guarantees of the Bill of Rights. Even if you commit crimes, you don't lose your protections of [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=725.52s)]
*  citizenship. Stripping of your citizenship or deporting you are not recognizable punishment [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=732.64s)]
*  under the law of the Constitution for committing a crime. In fact, some of the guarantees of the [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=739.84s)]
*  Bill of Rights are explicitly meant to protect criminals. People accused of vicious crimes still [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=745.52s)]
*  have the right to due process. They still have the right to an attorney. They have the right [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=751.36s)]
*  against self-incrimination. They have a right to a speedy trial. Even people who are convicted [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=756.24s)]
*  are protected against what the Constitution calls cruel and unusual punishments. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=763.84s)]
*  And the founders talked about all the time the need to protect the rights, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=769.12s)]
*  not just of the innocent, but the guilty. So when Trump says, why American citizens, are they in a [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=772.4s)]
*  special category when it comes to shipping them to El Salvador? Yes, yes, American citizens are in [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=779.44s)]
*  a special category with a lot of rights. For example, if you're an American citizen, you cannot [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=785.36s)]
*  be refused entry in the United States. If you come back to the United States, you can be arrested at [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=790.8800000000001s)]
*  the border, but you cannot be refused entry. That's one of the rights of citizenship. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=794.72s)]
*  And even if you're convicted of crimes, you still have rights in prison. You have the right to speak [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=801.36s)]
*  to your lawyer. You have the right to bring what you claim are legal or constitutional violations [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=805.28s)]
*  to an American court. You have the right, if there's new evidence discovered, to contest your [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=811.28s)]
*  conviction and to ask a court to overturn it, which happens quite frequently. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=817.1999999999999s)]
*  You can't be subject to abusive prison conditions or cruel and unusual. These are all [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=823.04s)]
*  foundational American rights for American citizens. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=827.1999999999999s)]
*  If you're comfortable with this idea that, no, there's nothing special about being an American [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=829.6s)]
*  citizen, they can be treated exactly the same way as people in the country illegally, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=832.88s)]
*  even when it comes to deporting you, if you're convicted of a crime. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=837.6800000000001s)]
*  I just want you to think about what would happen if the next Democratic president, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=842.0s)]
*  I don't know, Gavin Newsom or whoever, Gretchen Whitmer, Pete Buttigieg, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=844.96s)]
*  decides that people who committed violent crimes in connection with January 6, or if there's [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=852.24s)]
*  another protest like it and it spills into violence. Yeah, they're Americans, but they're [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=856.72s)]
*  going right to a dungeon in El Salvador. If you believe that American citizens can be deported [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=861.44s)]
*  to El Salvador, and not just to El Salvador, but to one of the world's worst prisons, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=867.0400000000001s)]
*  you don't have any rights there. You don't have a right to speak to a lawyer. You don't have a [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=873.0400000000001s)]
*  right to file court hearings and appeals or motions or new lawsuits. You have nothing, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=875.76s)]
*  no rights. All your rights are stripped from you, including rights guaranteed by the constitution. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=881.36s)]
*  If you believe Trump can do that, then why can't the next Democratic president do that? [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=889.04s)]
*  That's true for all the things Trump's doing, requiring colleges and universities, not the [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=894.0s)]
*  highest professors who have certain ideologies, putting speech codes on college campuses as a [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=899.2s)]
*  condition for getting federal funding. And that's not the case for all the things that [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=903.2s)]
*  getting federal funding as what happened with Harvard. And we'll talk about that a little bit [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=909.52s)]
*  in a second. But I just want to focus a little more on this because, again, I understand how [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=914.64s)]
*  Trump functions. I've watched him for a long time and not somebody who goes insane and gets hysterical. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=919.76s)]
*  The minute Trump opens his mouth and just says something off the cuff, this is not off the cuff. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=926.4s)]
*  He said it multiple times. Here's another part of his conversation that was kind of in private [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=930.8s)]
*  with Bukele, but not really because he knew there were cameras there. He's very press savvy. He [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=939.04s)]
*  understands that this was being recorded. And here's what he said with Bukele. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=943.36s)]
*  The matter is that people wanted to change their lives. They wanted to be the man they were. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=946.48s)]
*  They love you. They love what you do. I want to get you. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=951.92s)]
*  Homegrown criminals next. I said homegrowns are next. Homegrowns. You got to build about [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=956.9599999999999s)]
*  five more places. Yeah, that's better. All right. It's not big enough. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=966.0s)]
*  So this is a much different office than you're in. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=974.72s)]
*  All right. There's Trump saying to Bukele, look, I don't want to just send foreign [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=980.08s)]
*  nationals to El Salvador. I don't want to just send people who enter the country illegally. I [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=983.6s)]
*  want to send our own citizens, homegrown criminals. So we need you to build five more prisons like the [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=988.64s)]
*  megaprism that you built. But maybe there's a little bit of a facetiousness in there, but when [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=994.08s)]
*  it aligns with everything he's saying publicly in the press briefing in the Oval Office, when he's [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=999.2s)]
*  sitting with Bukele in interviews after. Sorry, that's just too radical of an idea not to object [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=1005.76s)]
*  to now, not wait until it starts to happen. And this is one of the things that has been a concern, [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=1013.2800000000001s)]
*  which is the idea that all these people being deported from American campuses for the crime [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=1020.16s)]
*  of protesting or denouncing Israel is not just, it's not people in the United States illegally. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=1025.36s)]
*  They're all people here legally. Some of them have student visas, but a couple of them now are [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=1031.76s)]
*  green card holders, at least a couple, meaning they're intended to be permanent residents [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=1038.1599999999999s)]
*  United States on the path to citizenship. So the question then becomes, what's next? We've [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=1043.2s)]
*  grown up the scale, illegal people in the US illegally, people who have work and student visas, [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=1047.36s)]
*  people who have green cards. And the concern is the next step is people who are naturalized [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=1052.1599999999999s)]
*  Americans, people who weren't born in the United States, who didn't begin life as a citizen, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=1057.6799999999998s)]
*  but who became American citizens during their life. People like Elon Musk, Melania Trump, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=1061.12s)]
*  Sebastian Gorka, David Sacks. We never had this distinction before between [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=1069.28s)]
*  Americans born on American soil who are real Americans and naturalized Americans who are [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=1076.24s)]
*  something else. There's no category or hierarchy of American citizenship. All American citizens [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=1080.0s)]
*  are the same. But based on things Marco Rubio has said, you can easily envision the State [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=1084.56s)]
*  Department saying, oh, these people who participated, even citizens in protests against Israel, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=1091.52s)]
*  they obtained their citizenship on false pretenses because they didn't tell us they were going to do [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=1097.52s)]
*  that. As if they were prescient enough to know that there was going to be this incomparably horrific [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=1101.68s)]
*  war in Gaza when they came four years ago or three years ago, or seven years ago or 10 years ago or [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=1107.44s)]
*  20 years ago. And then after that, if you can do that to naturalized citizens, you can do that to [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=1113.28s)]
*  citizens. And that's not a slippery slope hysterical argument. That's the way you have to think as a [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=1118.48s)]
*  citizen. In which direction is this going? Where does this end? And so the fact that Trump is now [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=1123.6000000000001s)]
*  talking about American citizens as not being special in any way when it comes to things like [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=1128.0s)]
*  deportation and even openly talking about sending them to El Salvador, that is a sign that that's [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=1133.12s)]
*  something to be concerned about. Not hysterical over, but concerned enough to report it, to analyze [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=1138.24s)]
*  it, to object to it, to explain why it would be a radical departure from everything that America [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=1146.4s)]
*  has ever stood for since its founding. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ftYMleYyg&t=1152.56s)]
