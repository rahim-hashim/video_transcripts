# Trump's RIFT with Tulsi?
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [June 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE)
*  Now there's clearly a rift between Tulsi Gabbard and Donald Trump, but it's not just kind of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=0.0s)]
*  back stage intrigue, palace intrigue with gossip appearing in Politico and Axios. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=13.86s)]
*  It's come forth into the public and it's a rift that is very substantive in nature. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  It's not just a personality conflict by all accounts. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=25.740000000000002s)]
*  Trump really likes Tulsi Gabbard personally, always has and still does. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=28.22s)]
*  Instead it's about this perception that she's not on board with his policy regarding Iran, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=32.42s)]
*  namely that Iran is seeking a nuclear weapon and war is necessary to prevent them from [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=38.14s)]
*  getting one. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=41.9s)]
*  Here from CNN, this is today, this morning, Trump's intel chief Tulsi Gabbard is, quote, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=44.58s)]
*  off message and out of favor, sources tell CNN, quote, though she's been among the most [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=50.94s)]
*  visible voices for the president's national security policy, behind the scenes Tulsi Gabbard [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=56.22s)]
*  has struggled to carve out her own place in the Trump White House. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=61.14s)]
*  Recently Trump has come to see her as, quote, off message when it comes to the conflict [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=64.94s)]
*  in the Middle East. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=68.62s)]
*  According to one senior White House advisor, Trump's terse rebuke of his top intelligence [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=69.9s)]
*  official, and we showed you that several times where he was asked, Air Force One by Caitlin [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=75.02s)]
*  Collins, why are you so sure that Iran was seeking nuclear weapons when your own DNI, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=83.06s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard, told the Senate in March that the best intel, the consensus of the intelligence [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=86.86s)]
*  community was that nothing had changed, they were not seeking nuclear weapons, and Trump [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=91.34s)]
*  very snobby said, I don't care what she says, I don't care what Tulsi says, they were seeking [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=94.86s)]
*  nuclear weapons. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=99.66s)]
*  And a very public humiliation, I don't care what she says. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=100.66s)]
*  Not like, oh, I think she might be misinformed or maybe things changed since then. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=105.5s)]
*  She's like, I don't care what Tulsi Gabbard says, that's his director of national intelligence, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=110.06s)]
*  and he's saying that publicly, like who cares what she says. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=115.14s)]
*  Trump's terse rebuke of his top intelligence official set off a firestorm among the MAGA [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=119.62s)]
*  faithful on right wing media, long divided over the issue of Iran. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=124.46000000000001s)]
*  It also raised serious questions about Gabbard standing in the administration. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=128.34s)]
*  Just a month ago, White House officials insisted that the president not only liked Gabbard [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=133.02s)]
*  but enjoyed her company. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=136.5s)]
*  Even as some of the administration believed that she was out of her depth, officials insisted [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=138.74s)]
*  that Trump and his team were giving Gabbard leeway to learn the ropes of her new job. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=142.3s)]
*  But that tone has shifted as multiple people inside the West Wing have grown disillusion [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=147.78s)]
*  with Gabbard's performance, sources say. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=152.54000000000002s)]
*  Trump's annoyance with Gabbard peaked earlier this month, this person said, when she posted [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=156.06s)]
*  a three minute video warning that the world is, quote, closer to the brink of nuclear [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=159.34s)]
*  before and blaming, quote, political elites and warmongers for stoking, quote, fear and [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=165.14s)]
*  tensions between nuclear powers. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=170.85999999999999s)]
*  Trump viewed the video as a thinly veiled criticism of his consideration to allow Israel [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=173.94s)]
*  to strike Iran, and many inside the White House agreed Gabbard was speaking out of turn, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=178.98s)]
*  the person added. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=182.61999999999998s)]
*  Now, we're going to show you that video in a second, but let me just say that I actually, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=183.61999999999998s)]
*  when I watched that video, I did not think she was speaking about Iran or was alluding [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=187.42s)]
*  to Iran because, as that article quoted, she was warning of the dangers of war between [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=194.14s)]
*  nuclear armed powers. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=202.33999999999997s)]
*  To me, that meant Ukraine and Russia, and obviously Ukraine's on nuclear power, but [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=203.61999999999998s)]
*  Russia on one side and the United States and the UK and France on the other are. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=208.7s)]
*  Maybe she's talking about Israel and Iran and Israel and the United States and Middle [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=215.58s)]
*  East wars, but Iran, of course, is not a nuclear power. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=222.1s)]
*  Some people interpreted it as actually supportive of the Trump view, meaning she went to Hiroshima [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=226.3s)]
*  and Nagasaki and made a video about the evils of nuclear war, nuclear weapons, saying, I [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=231.14s)]
*  can see the negative effects, the destructive effects. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=239.82s)]
*  To this very day, we have to ensure that we don't ever have one of these again. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=243.34s)]
*  You could make the case that that's an argument in support of Donald Trump's view that it's [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=247.98s)]
*  too dangerous to allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=252.45999999999998s)]
*  I think what's really going on here is the Trump administration was constructed, and [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=256.98s)]
*  I actually was hearing this all the time prior to the election and especially in the transition. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=264.58s)]
*  We had people on my show who were very close to Trump who said this publicly. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=269.38s)]
*  I've heard this privately, that their view of the world, the Trump circle's view of the [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=272.98s)]
*  world was that in the first term, they really didn't know much of what they were doing. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=278.78s)]
*  They allowed too many people into the government, into the administration, into the White House [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=282.65999999999997s)]
*  who pretended to be loyal to Trump, but in fact were actively sabotaging what he was [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=287.34s)]
*  trying to do, sometimes to create favor with the media, sometimes because they were just [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=292.18s)]
*  operating according to their own ideological preferences. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=297.46s)]
*  They were determined to build an administration this time based solely on loyalty to Trump, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=301.42s)]
*  meaning a recognition that the only decision maker is Donald Trump, and once he decides, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=305.9s)]
*  everybody else's job is to carry that message forward, defend it as convincingly as possible [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=310.18s)]
*  and to carry out his orders. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=317.18s)]
*  I'm not necessarily even opposed to that kind of an approach, given what I do think happened [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=320.62s)]
*  in the first term where there was a subversion of the idea of civilian rule, where the military [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=325.66s)]
*  and intelligence community were constantly undermining and subverting Trump because they [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=331.22s)]
*  didn't think his decisions were the right ones, even though they were duty bound to [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=335.14s)]
*  follow them and wanted to pursue their own agenda. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=337.78000000000003s)]
*  They kept things from him, they lied to him, they manipulated him, they leaked things. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=340.82s)]
*  Sometimes they just did what they wanted. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=344.46s)]
*  But I never quite understood how Tulsi Gabbard was going to fit into an administration like [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=348.98s)]
*  that because obviously she's an ambitious person. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=352.74s)]
*  She had a lot of success early on, catapulted herself very quickly through the political [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=357.14s)]
*  ranks to become director of national intelligence, overseeing the entire intelligence community, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=364.14s)]
*  one of the most important jobs in the administration and the cabinet. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=368.9s)]
*  So she is politically ambitious, but I also know she's a person of principle and integrity. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=374.12s)]
*  I'm not saying she's perfect, I'm not saying she doesn't make compromises to gain power. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=377.54s)]
*  Pretty much anybody who gains power makes those kind of compromises and you can find [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=383.66s)]
*  plenty of evidence that she has, but I know that she has an internal core. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=387.46000000000004s)]
*  I never really could see her being somebody who was willing to go forward and defend views [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=392.18s)]
*  that she didn't really agree with. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=398.5s)]
*  She might do it out of a sense of duty. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=402.34000000000003s)]
*  Remember she is a soldier, she's been a soldier for 25 years, she still is in the Army Reserve [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=404.1s)]
*  so she does have that idea of the chain of command, the commander in chief. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=408.46s)]
*  But she's also a person who won't be part of an institution if she believes it's gone [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=412.3s)]
*  off base as she demonstrated when she resigned her position as DNC vice chair, basically [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=416.38s)]
*  sabotaging her future, which was very bright, within the Democratic party. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=421.66s)]
*  So I'm not surprised by any of this at all. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=426.78s)]
*  Here from Axios, this is yesterday, Scoop, I love when they call their own dumb, gossipy, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=430.26s)]
*  palace intrigue articles Scoops as though the Pulitzer committee ought to get ready to [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=436.82000000000005s)]
*  recognize it with a big award. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=443.46000000000004s)]
*  Gabbard's Senate intel briefing is postponed among Iran tensions. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=446.38000000000005s)]
*  This I do think is notable. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=452.18s)]
*  Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard's scheduled briefing with the Senate intelligence [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=453.18s)]
*  community was postponed on Wednesday amid outgoing tension in the Middle East, multiple [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=458.90000000000003s)]
*  sources told Axios. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=463.54s)]
*  Democrats are demanding more information from the White House as President Trump considers [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=466.46s)]
*  joining the Israeli offensive against Iran. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=470.38s)]
*  Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, senior member of that committee, of the Foreign [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=472.38s)]
*  Relations Committee, told Axios on Wednesday that despite being able to spend two hours [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=476.46s)]
*  with intel community officials this week, key questions remain unanswered. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=480.62s)]
*  Quote, the cost, the duration, the risk to our troops, the strategy, the basics before [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=485.58s)]
*  we make a decision of this consequence, Coons said. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=490.74s)]
*  Gabbard's team told Axios that the briefing is being rescheduled and there was bipartisan [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=494.06s)]
*  agreement to do so given schedules on the Senate side as well. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=497.82s)]
*  Now maybe that's true. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=502.78000000000003s)]
*  Maybe they just all had really busy schedules, but it seems to me like there aren't things [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=505.7s)]
*  more pressing either for the Senate Intelligence Committee, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=510.42s)]
*  or the administration and its leading intelligence official than to go to the Senate and have [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=517.22s)]
*  briefings on what exactly Trump is planning. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=523.3399999999999s)]
*  The idea that that just couldn't happen because they had scheduled conflicts, like what's [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=526.9399999999999s)]
*  more important to that? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=529.78s)]
*  Maybe but it seems like another clue that Tulsi is being excluded. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=531.5s)]
*  Probably the most disturbing clue was one that happened before all this happened, which [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=539.2199999999999s)]
*  was before the Israeli attack on Iran, before President Trump made clear that he was advised [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=542.5799999999999s)]
*  of it, approved of it, supported it, wanted to make the war his own. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=547.2199999999999s)]
*  There was a big meeting at Camp David to talk about the Iran issue and notably Tulsi Gabbard [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=551.62s)]
*  was not there. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=556.94s)]
*  How could you have a meeting like that without having your intelligence chief there? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=558.3000000000001s)]
*  The whole question is, is Iran getting nuclear weapons? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=562.22s)]
*  What's going on in Iran? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=566.3000000000001s)]
*  What are they planning? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=567.3000000000001s)]
*  What's Israel planning? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=568.3000000000001s)]
*  To purposely exclude the director of national intelligence, knowing that she's someone who [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=569.3000000000001s)]
*  argues strenuously that Iran is not seeking nuclear weapons and instead fill it with all [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=575.5s)]
*  the war hawks, which is basically what happened, was a very alarming sign. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=581.3s)]
*  At first they tried claiming that that too was a schedule conflict, that Tulsi wasn't [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=586.8199999999999s)]
*  there not because she wasn't invited but because she was too busy. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=590.2199999999999s)]
*  What would a DNI have more important than going to Camp David to have a meeting on the [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=594.66s)]
*  brink of war? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=598.9399999999999s)]
*  Obviously nothing. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=600.9s)]
*  Her absence was very telling. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=602.8199999999999s)]
*  Peter Ducey on Fox News last week reported Jennifer Griffin as saying this. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=604.7s)]
*  My colleague Peter Ducey is reporting that the president's top intelligence chief, Tulsi [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=611.78s)]
*  Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, was not invited to Camp David on June 8th [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=616.22s)]
*  where the intelligence and plans were being discussed. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=622.14s)]
*  She was on national guard duty at the time but U.S. officials tell Peter she was never [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=624.78s)]
*  invited in the first place. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=629.24s)]
*  She is in the situation room today, however. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=630.6800000000001s)]
*  I mean, yeah, I think she probably could have gotten out of Army Reserve guard duty since [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=634.66s)]
*  she works and is a key official for the commander in chief. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=640.78s)]
*  Probably would have given her permission to be excused from her Army Reserve duty to attend [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=645.02s)]
*  the Camp David meeting but as Fox reported she was not invited. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=649.06s)]
*  I guess nobody wanted to hear her view despite it being the consensus of the intelligence community. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=653.82s)]
*  Here's a political article just kind of adding some flavor and color to the tension between [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=660.86s)]
*  Trump and Tulsi. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=667.1800000000001s)]
*  Politico from June 17th, quote, as President Donald Trump privately mauled joining Israel's [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=669.66s)]
*  campaign against Iran this month, one member of his cabinet sent what he viewed as an audacious [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=674.38s)]
*  attempt to steer him in the opposite direction. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=681.34s)]
*  At 5.30 a.m. on June 10th, director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard tweeted a cryptic [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=684.8000000000001s)]
*  three-minute video warning that, quote, political elites and warmongers are, quote, carelessly [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=689.34s)]
*  fomenting fear and real tensions between nuclear powers and that the world is, unquote, the [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=693.98s)]
*  brink of nuclear annihilation. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=700.38s)]
*  Trump saw the unauthorized video and became incensed, complaining to associates at the [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=702.26s)]
*  White House that she had spoken out of turn, according to three people familiar with the [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=707.26s)]
*  episode, two of them inside the administration and all granted anonymity to describe sensitive [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=710.62s)]
*  dynamics. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=715.3000000000001s)]
*  Her post came a few days after Israel hawks met with Trump at the White House to lobby [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=716.82s)]
*  him to support Israel's attack on Iran. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=721.4000000000001s)]
*  In the eyes of Trump and some close to him, Gabbard was warning him not to greenlight [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=724.2s)]
*  Israel attacking Iran. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=728.98s)]
*  Trump even expressed his disapproval of her personally, the three people said. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=731.38s)]
*  In recent months, Trump has increasingly mused about Nixon Gabbard's office completely. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=735.94s)]
*  Gabbard's tweet about nuclear war may have spurred those conversations along. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=741.5s)]
*  So, always a warning with this kind of Axios political, you know, people inside the administration [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=744.98s)]
*  are telling us, I don't think these people make that up. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=752.46s)]
*  I'm not saying they never do, but I don't think in cases like this kind of gossip they [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=754.78s)]
*  do. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=757.86s)]
*  But oftentimes these anonymous sources are very, very politically motivated to disempower [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=758.86s)]
*  or detach people who they perceive as contrary to the agenda they want to pursue. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=767.46s)]
*  Clearly an attempt to kind of disempower Tulsi, to leak that Trump's angry at her and raged [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=774.22s)]
*  by her. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=779.02s)]
*  I will note that her absence from this discourse, combined with her lack of invitation to the [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=780.7s)]
*  Camp David Accords and any sort of public expression has been extremely notable. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=787.7800000000001s)]
*  Her absence has been very conspicuous and very loud. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=793.7800000000001s)]
*  The canceling of her testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee, it's all by [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=797.98s)]
*  itself maybe, not enough to be conclusive, but taken together I think the signs are pretty [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=802.16s)]
*  clear that she's on the outs and is so because she has been a long time opponent of having [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=806.96s)]
*  the US go to war in Iran for Israel. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=817.5600000000001s)]
*  And because she has been, I guess, quote, off message in that she's trying to get Trump [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=822.04s)]
*  to see that the intelligence community doesn't agree with what Netanyahu and Mark Levin and [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=828.1999999999999s)]
*  Sean Hannity are trying to convince him to believe. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=833.76s)]
*  That they're on the verge of getting nuclear weapons, they're milliseconds away. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=837.4s)]
*  They would have had it at like 11 PM, 1101 PM, and Israel not started bombing at 10, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=842.0799999999999s)]
*  12 PM. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=848.24s)]
*  You know, this kind of idiocy that has begun so many wars over the last 60 years in the [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=849.24s)]
*  going back to the lies about the Gulf of Tonkin in Vietnam and everything forward. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=855.28s)]
*  Here's a part of that, what I agree is a cryptic video that Tulsi posted. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=861.5600000000001s)]
*  It was on June 10th, just a day or two before the Israeli attacks began. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=865.64s)]
*  And it was a very produced video. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=872.52s)]
*  She put a lot of thought into it. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=875.96s)]
*  It obviously had a purpose. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=876.96s)]
*  She posted it on her Tulsi Gabbard ex account and I think on a couple of other YouTube accounts, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=878.2s)]
*  a couple of other social media accounts. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=886.2s)]
*  And here is part of it. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=887.9200000000001s)]
*  This isn't some made up science fiction story. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=889.5600000000001s)]
*  This is the reality of what's at stake, what we are facing now. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=893.0600000000001s)]
*  Because as we stand here today, closer to the brink of nuclear annihilation than ever [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=897.5600000000001s)]
*  Political elite and warmongers are carelessly fomenting fear and tensions between nuclear [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=903.36s)]
*  powers. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=908.92s)]
*  Perhaps it's because they are confident that they will have access to nuclear shelters [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=910.92s)]
*  for themselves and for their families that regular people won't have access to. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=915.3000000000001s)]
*  So it's up to us, the people, to speak up and demand an end to this madness. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=921.6800000000001s)]
*  We must reject this path to nuclear war and work toward a world where no one has to live [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=929.0s)]
*  in fear of a nuclear holocaust. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=935.16s)]
*  Now as I said, you could interpret that as being an on message video that you could interpret [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=940.04s)]
*  as look, this is all the more reason we have to be sure that Iran doesn't get a nuclear [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=947.12s)]
*  weapon. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=950.68s)]
*  It's too dangerous. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=951.68s)]
*  Nuclear annihilation is too dangerous for the world. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=952.68s)]
*  But there's a lot of odd aspects to this video. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=955.62s)]
*  She doesn't actually talk about that specific conflict, which everybody else was obviously [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=958.24s)]
*  thinking of and speaking of. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=962.32s)]
*  But also the way she spoke, she's basically making a disclosure, what seems like a disclosure, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=965.1800000000001s)]
*  a kind of classified disclosure. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=974.28s)]
*  Look, the reason a lot of people in decision making powers in major capitals like the United [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=976.48s)]
*  States or elsewhere aren't as fearful of nuclear war as you might be or should be is because [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=981.92s)]
*  they have very effective and fortified shelters that they know they will take refuge in with [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=988.36s)]
*  themselves and their families in the event that a nuclear war might happen or is on the [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=994.24s)]
*  verge of happening so they'll be safe, whereas you won't be. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=999.96s)]
*  And she said it's kind of up to us, the people, to make sure that doesn't happen. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1002.88s)]
*  Now obviously she's one of the very top officials in the US government if such shelters exist, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1007.96s)]
*  and I know they do. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1012.6400000000001s)]
*  I don't know how effective they are, but I'm sure they put a lot of thought into making [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1014.08s)]
*  them as effective as they can be. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1020.0s)]
*  She's somebody who would be one of the first ones in there. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1023.3199999999999s)]
*  But she made this kind of narrative like she's not one of the national security elites who [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1027.32s)]
*  would get into the shelters. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1032.28s)]
*  She's part of us, the people, urging us to rise up against these unnamed warmongers and [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1033.28s)]
*  elites who are trying to foment tension between nuclear armed powers. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1039.32s)]
*  So it definitely wasn't an on-message video, that's for sure. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1042.96s)]
*  I don't know that it was as off-message as people thought, that this was like a specific [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1048.52s)]
*  attempt to sabotage Trump's position on Iran, though it certainly could have been. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1052.08s)]
*  It kind of came out of nowhere, there was no context to it, she wasn't speaking in her [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1057.52s)]
*  capacity as DNI. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1061.44s)]
*  She just made this trip to Japan, to nuclear weapon sites, she did it for a reason. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1064.68s)]
*  But she didn't want to be very explicit about what her warnings were, but I guess she left [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1070.48s)]
*  it to everybody else to try and decipher them, and at least from Trump's view, that was done [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1074.24s)]
*  not to forward or advance his war designs, but potentially to undercut them. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1080.3600000000001s)]
*  And if that were true, that wouldn't surprise me at all, for a reason we're about to show [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1089.0800000000002s)]
*  you. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1092.2s)]
*  Just before we show you some of that, here is the testimony that Tulsi Gabbard gave to [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1093.2s)]
*  the Senate Intelligence Committee less than three months ago, on March 25, 2005, speaking [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1097.96s)]
*  in the public session of the Senate Intelligence Committee, when specifically asked whether [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1105.32s)]
*  the intelligence shows that Iran has now changed its mind, that there's an order from the Ayatollah [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1110.0s)]
*  to start acquiring nuclear weapons, developing nuclear weapons. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1116.28s)]
*  Here's what Tulsi said about that. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1119.84s)]
*  The IC continues to assess that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon, and Supreme Leader [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1123.04s)]
*  Kameny has not authorized the nuclear weapons program that he suspended in 2003. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1128.52s)]
*  The IC continues to monitor closely if Tehran decides to reauthorize its nuclear weapons [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1133.42s)]
*  program. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1138.6200000000001s)]
*  Now, one of the things I thought was going to happen is once Trump publicly insisted [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1139.6200000000001s)]
*  that Iran was about to get nukes, that Netanyahu was right, and if you listen to Trump supporters [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1147.78s)]
*  who want this war, to them, they don't have any evidence, but it's just a given that [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1152.52s)]
*  Iran is just on the verge of getting nuclear weapons. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1158.16s)]
*  They're trying to get them, they're about to get them, and the only relevant question [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1160.36s)]
*  is do you want Iran to have nuclear weapons, or do you want to go to war to stop them? [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1164.48s)]
*  They don't recognize a third alternative, which is that Iran wasn't seeking nuclear [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1168.32s)]
*  weapons, isn't seeking nuclear weapons, has an active nuclear energy program like they [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1172.84s)]
*  always have, and was very amenable to a negotiation that would have preserved the right to have [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1176.04s)]
*  nuclear energy but not to get nuclear weapons. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1180.28s)]
*  I mean at least when George Bush and Dick Cheney wanted to go invade Iraq, they had [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1184.48s)]
*  to like engage in a major six-month complex, multi-faceted campaign of government media [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1189.36s)]
*  propaganda to convince the public to support it, to convince them that they had weapons [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1197.24s)]
*  of mass destruction. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1200.28s)]
*  It was hard to convince the public of that. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1201.6399999999999s)]
*  They sent Colin Powell with all those little test tubes he was holding up with things in [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1203.16s)]
*  them and very grainy satellite maps using his credibility that he had built up over [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1208.64s)]
*  many years to ratify that lie they used in the New York Times. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1212.3600000000001s)]
*  They had a whole wide range of a complicated PR campaign that took six months. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1215.56s)]
*  This time it's just instant. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1224.24s)]
*  You have people who weren't saying any of this a week ago who now just walk around like [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1225.8s)]
*  zombies saying if you question whether or not we should go to war, they'll say do you [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1229.1200000000001s)]
*  want Iran to get nukes? [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1232.48s)]
*  It's like the assumption, the unquestioned assumption is that they are even though Tulsi [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1234.84s)]
*  went before the Senate and said they weren't. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1238.56s)]
*  Now I expected at some point she was going to come out and say look that was three months [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1241.3999999999999s)]
*  ago, the intelligence has changed. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1246.0s)]
*  Maybe they'll get her to say that but so far she hasn't and that is very striking. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1249.1599999999999s)]
*  And I have to say I might be misjudging Tulsi. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1256.1599999999999s)]
*  I don't want to overstate how well I know her. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1262.6399999999999s)]
*  Especially I've spoken a lot more to her maybe in the past few years than I have in the last [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1265.7199999999998s)]
*  couple of years but I still don't believe she's a person who would come out and lie [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1271.04s)]
*  and say the intelligence now shows that Iran is seeking a nuclear weapon just to cling [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1275.3999999999999s)]
*  to her job. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1279.76s)]
*  I do not believe she would do that. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1280.76s)]
*  Maybe I'm being naive, maybe I'm giving her too much credit but that is my view of Tulsi. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1282.04s)]
*  Most people don't need to hear this, they already know this but debt once you get into [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1290.04s)]
*  it adds up very fast. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1293.52s)]
*  I'm talking about things like credit cards, personal loans, medical bills and suddenly [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1294.6399999999999s)]
*  many people find themselves buried under interest with no clear way out. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1298.6399999999999s)]
*  That's not a coincidence. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1302.48s)]
*  Creditors want you stuck that way. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1303.8799999999999s)]
*  They profit when you're overwhelmed, drowning in interest payments, making it harder for [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1305.92s)]
*  you to move forward but you don't have to stay trapped in that system. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0EArm-DnE&t=1309.3999999999999s)]
