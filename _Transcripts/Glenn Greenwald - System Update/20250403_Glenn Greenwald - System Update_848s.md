# Matt Taibbi Baselessly Attacked During Censorship Hearing
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [April 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4)
*  Yesterday there was a hearing on the JFK documents and we covered that by having Jefferson Morley [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=0.0s)]
*  on our show who was a witness at that hearing. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=13.44s)]
*  He talked about the hearing itself, the discovery of CIA related documents in the JFK files. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  But there was also in a different committee a hearing to investigate the censorship industrial [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=23.44s)]
*  complex, the program by the Biden administration to censor dissent by coercing big tech companies, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=29.36s)]
*  by threatening big tech companies in terms of what they can allow and what they can't allow, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=37.92s)]
*  controlling them to remove dissent on Covid, Ukraine, a whole variety of other issues. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=42.72s)]
*  And one of the witnesses who was testifying was our friend the journalist Matt Taibbi and he did [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  that of course because of his work on the Twitter files, which was one of the main sources of [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=53.760000000000005s)]
*  information to show how the government was pressuring social media companies and big tech. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=58.4s)]
*  So that's why he was there. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=63.839999999999996s)]
*  The Democrats invited to sit next to him that utterly crazy woman who they wanted to put in [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=64.8s)]
*  charge and make the disinformation czar as part of Homeland Security, Nene Yankovitch. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=70.24s)]
*  And even in our society that loves censorship and that is in love with this idea of experts [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=74.88s)]
*  identifying disinformation for you because they know more than you do about what is true and what [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=81.52s)]
*  is false and they're going to protect you from false things. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=85.68s)]
*  She was such a caricature of kind of a liberal censor that she was just a bridge too far even [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=87.92s)]
*  for our political culture when Biden was president. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=94.72000000000001s)]
*  So they had to kind of scrap that and she's been very angry about that ever since. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=96.96000000000001s)]
*  But I just want to show you how scummy people in Congress can be. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=101.04s)]
*  So Matt Taibbi was there as a journalist and if you know Matt he has a very mild mannered demeanor. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=106.88000000000001s)]
*  He's very polite, very soft spoken. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=114.24s)]
*  If you engage him in debate he's not really a combative personality. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=118.47999999999999s)]
*  You know sometimes I watch Matt in these circumstances my aggression kicks in. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=123.28s)]
*  I just say Matt say this but you know push him but that's not how Matt is. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=127.03999999999999s)]
*  He's his efficacy isn't just always kind of remaining even keeled. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=130.0s)]
*  I've never seen him be disrespectful to anybody. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=134.72s)]
*  So of course you know if you're going to denounce the censorship regime of Joe Biden [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=137.84s)]
*  you're going to have Democrats who are going to be angry at you even though it's again something [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=143.92s)]
*  that had been so fundamental to left liberal politics for decades. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=149.11999999999998s)]
*  The idea of free speech now it's not at all. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=152.0s)]
*  So Matt Taibbi was there he got invited he went to testify in Washington. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=155.27999999999997s)]
*  Left his family left his kids to go do it and here's one of here's the ranking member of that [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=159.83999999999997s)]
*  committee her name is Sydney Commager Dove. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=164.79999999999998s)]
*  She's a member of Congress a Democratic member of Congress and here's what she did [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=168.0s)]
*  in response to Matt's testimony. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=172.88s)]
*  Majority is relitigating a made-up conspiracy theory about a part of the state department [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=177.35999999999999s)]
*  that no longer exists to distract from the dumpster fire foreign policy this administration is [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=183.51999999999998s)]
*  pursuing and elevating a serial sexual harasser as their star witness in the process. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=189.76s)]
*  Mr. Chair I request unanimous consent to enter into the record two articles [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=196.72s)]
*  about the Republican witness Matt Taibbi. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=201.92s)]
*  The first is a Chicago Reader article entitled 20 years ago in Moscow Matt Taibbi was a misogynist [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=204.08s)]
*  a-hole and possibly worse and a Washington Post article titled the two expat bros who [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=211.2s)]
*  terrorized women correspondents in Moscow. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=217.44s)]
*  This hearing could not be more out of touch with the concerns of [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=221.68s)]
*  Okay do you see how scummy that is? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=225.6s)]
*  20 years ago in Moscow according to newspapers and these were old newspaper articles so now [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=230.56s)]
*  it's 25 years ago almost 30 years ago Matt Taibbi terrorized women. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=239.76000000000002s)]
*  This all came from a work of fiction that Matt Taibbi's partner Mark Ames wrote [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=245.12s)]
*  and it was a like the newspaper exile that they had an extremely satirical newspaper they were [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=252.16s)]
*  quite young they were Matt you know kind of in particular got known for a sort of raucous [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=261.03999999999996s)]
*  style of writing I remember reading him when I was in law school or even as a lawyer in the New [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=265.36s)]
*  York Observer the New York Press he had a column there and it was very you know it was very [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=272.0s)]
*  satirical it was very ironic but this book in particular was fiction it was a work of fiction [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=276.96s)]
*  and a lot of articles that came out right when Matt Taibbi had a new book out were designed to [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=284.23999999999995s)]
*  depict him as some sort of misogynist like one of the victims of the Me Too movement you know like [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=291.59999999999997s)]
*  or a perpetrator or predator of the Me Too movement and then once these newspaper articles ran [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=296.0s)]
*  several of them ended up retracting the article because the thing that was missing [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=302.0s)]
*  from Matt Taibbi's reign of terror against women in Moscow was a single woman a single woman [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=307.84s)]
*  who identified herself as his victim no one ever complained about Matt Taibbi in any way [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=313.91999999999996s)]
*  there's no woman to this day who has ever said oh Matt Taibbi harassed me he treated me inappropriately [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=318.79999999999995s)]
*  and yet this this scumbag of a congresswoman is exploiting the Me Too movement let me just say too [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=326.96s)]
*  that right now in New York City the leading candidate to become mayor of New York [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=336.0s)]
*  is the Democrat Andrew Cuomo who had to resign from the gubernatorial his gubernatorial position [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=343.04s)]
*  several years ago because he was engulfed in a multiple woman scandal and alleging sexual [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=349.6s)]
*  harassment or inappropriate sexual behavior he was forced out of office and the entire democratic [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=356.64s)]
*  establishment is now going to align behind Andrew Cuomo because they don't actually care at all [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=361.76s)]
*  those were they were actually victims alleged victims they're rising up and saying yes he [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=366.8s)]
*  treated me improperly they don't care about that at all every four years the democratic [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=371.2s)]
*  convention hosts Bill Clinton who's been not just credibly accused of sexual assault but even of [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=376.71999999999997s)]
*  rape in feminist groups throughout the 90s defended Bill Clinton defended Bill Clinton [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=383.28s)]
*  against all of these women accusers [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=389.52s)]
*  Hillary Clinton demeaned their character attacked the victims [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=393.28s)]
*  James Carville said oh yeah if you drag a dollar through a trailer park you never know [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=398.79999999999995s)]
*  what kind of trash you're going to find Joe Biden himself had all kinds of accusations [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=402.64s)]
*  about inappropriate behavior with women you think these people care in the slightest they so cynically [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=409.28s)]
*  and cheaply exploit this issue the me too issue sexual harassment womanizing feminism they don't [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=415.36s)]
*  believe in it at all and like what relevance did it even have Matt's there to talk as a journalist [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=422.56s)]
*  about an investigation that he did and she's like hey by the way 30 years ago some newspaper said [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=428.32s)]
*  that he was harassing women he never got sued he was never charged there's no victim newspapers [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=432.72s)]
*  retracted it when they understood that it was actually based on a work of fiction primarily [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=440.48s)]
*  written by his partner Mark Ames who also has never been accused of any of that by any woman [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=444.96000000000004s)]
*  but they'll just whip it out because they just want to demean and malign anybody who [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=451.76s)]
*  criticized Biden's censorship regime and here's the rest of what she said [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=458.48s)]
*  this hearing could not be more out of touch with the concerns of everyday Americans [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=464.40000000000003s)]
*  people's retirement savings are being decimated as Trump's arbitrary temper tariffs tank the [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=469.44s)]
*  stock market they are staring down the barrel of cuts to their social security and Medicare [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=474.8s)]
*  because the Republican majority wants to give a tax break to billionaires like Elon Musk who have [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=480.24s)]
*  deep financial ties to our adversaries meanwhile Trump is siding with Putin against our national [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=485.2s)]
*  security interests and risking the lives of American soldiers in a signal group chat I've [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=490.48s)]
*  been to the state department and I do have concerns about censorship censorship of the [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=496.08s)]
*  employees who are terrified to say the wrong thing to say anything or have the wrong word [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=501.28s)]
*  in their job title and be terminated by an administration that publicly relishes punishing [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=507.12s)]
*  people for their speech if we want to talk about censorship we should begin with Trump's unprecedented [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=512.16s)]
*  assault on the first amendment and rule of law okay first of all these people are such frauds [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=518.3199999999999s)]
*  it makes me sick it makes me sick it is the left liberal establishment in the west that has [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=523.68s)]
*  largely imposed a censorship regime it came from 2016 by the dual traumas for western liberalism [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=529.4399999999999s)]
*  of the British people voting to leave the EU in contempt of the Brussels bureaucrats that ruled [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=535.12s)]
*  their lives followed three or four months later by the shock of Trump's victory over the ultimate [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=541.8399999999999s)]
*  establishment maven Hillary Clinton after that they decided all of them that they could not afford [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=548.0s)]
*  free speech they could not permit free speech anymore on the internet because when you do so [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=552.0s)]
*  you can't control how people vote and they can talk to a whole new industry called the [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=555.68s)]
*  disinformation industry a whole expertise they fabricated out of a whole cloth disinformation [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=560.32s)]
*  experts that really does not exist and none of these people pretended to believe in free [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=564.56s)]
*  speech none of these people have any concern about it and she began by saying why are we even talking [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=570.24s)]
*  about these things the only things that we should be talking about are the economic suffering of [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=577.2s)]
*  ordinary Americans which is so ironic because the reason people hate the Democratic Party is [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=581.52s)]
*  because they've never been interested in that not in the last decade they've been talking about [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=585.1999999999999s)]
*  Russiagate and Putin and Trump loving Hitler just anything that they could fabricate and concoct [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=590.0799999999999s)]
*  that had nothing to do with the lives of ordinary immigrants who are they going to fool now by [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=602.88s)]
*  pretending oh we shouldn't be even talking about an attack on people's fundamental free speech [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=607.2s)]
*  rights because it's just really irrelevant but that is the Democratic Party just pure and simple [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=612.88s)]
*  they they even when they try to kind of change their brand and feign concern with the working [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=620.32s)]
*  class or whatever it's just so unconvincing everybody knows that's not at all what their [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=626.6400000000001s)]
*  interests are they know that they've been told that consultants have told them you need to start [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=630.8000000000001s)]
*  making people believe that's what you care about but that's not what they care about in the slightest [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuL2CYp_gd4&t=635.3599999999999s)]
