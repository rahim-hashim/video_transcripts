# Glenn Greenwald & Aaron Mat√© Revisit the Russiagate Scandal
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [February 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M)
*  Now, to help us explore and understand more about the origins of this story, about some [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=0.0s)]
*  of these prongs of the Russiagate scandal that were completely false, and to understand [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=14.64s)]
*  the ongoing implications and why American elites are so desperate to just forget this [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=21.44s)]
*  if you bring up the 100 Biden laptop, if you bring up Russiagate, they'll act like you're [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=26.959999999999997s)]
*  talking about something trivial in the past that everyone should just forget about, move [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=31.36s)]
*  on, precisely because it reveals the truth about it. We are going to speak with Aaron [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=34.64s)]
*  Mate, who, as I said, was one of the very few journalists willing from the start to [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=40.64s)]
*  put his career on the line to state that so much of this not only was evidence but made [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=44.32s)]
*  no sense and he was particularly in a risky situation because he had long worked in progressive [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=51.6s)]
*  media and it was heresy to do what they decided to view as defending Donald Trump when in [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=56.96s)]
*  fact it was just doing his job as a journalist. He became, in my view, one of the two or three [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=63.68s)]
*  people who became most expertise, had most expertise in the details and kind of the [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=68.56s)]
*  granular facts of Russiagate, and so we were not going to do this retrospective without [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=74.64s)]
*  talking to Aaron, given what an important journalistic role he played, and I think [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=80.96s)]
*  the interview that we did with him, we taped it yesterday, sheds a lot more light on some of the [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=84.55999999999999s)]
*  key issues and the reason why this deserves ongoing and systemic attention. Here's our interview. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=89.67999999999999s)]
*  Aaron, thank you so much for joining us tonight. There's nobody with whom I would rather do this [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=99.19999999999999s)]
*  show than you, and I really appreciate you taking the time to talk to us. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=103.67999999999999s)]
*  Good to be here. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=107.52000000000001s)]
*  Absolutely. So let's go back to the very beginning, the kind of origin of this entire [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=109.52000000000001s)]
*  debacle that came to be known as Russiagate. I think there's been a lot of confusion deliberately [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=114.48s)]
*  stoked by Democrats who now want to distance themselves from what had been their primary [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=119.84s)]
*  political weapon by saying, oh, it wasn't the Hillary Clinton campaign or the Democratic Party [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=125.04s)]
*  that created this narrative. Instead, it was actually anti-Trump media outlets and operatives [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=130.48000000000002s)]
*  who did it, and we just kind of in the Hillary Clinton campaign just inherited it once those [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=136.88s)]
*  other candidates dropped out. How do you, and obviously there was a lot of involvement in the [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=141.36s)]
*  U.S. security state and the corporate media. When you look back on all of this and you look to the [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=145.92000000000002s)]
*  origins of where this scandal began, how do you assign the blame? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=150.32s)]
*  The origins are with the Democratic Party, specifically the Hillary Clinton campaign, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=154.08s)]
*  which hired the opposition research firm Fusion GPS in the spring of 2016. I believe the exact [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=162.48000000000002s)]
*  month is May and immediately got them to start looking into what they imagined were Trump's ties [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=169.36s)]
*  to Russia. Why they chose Russia, I'm not sure. One rumored reason is that Hillary Clinton was [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=175.44s)]
*  at that point under scrutiny for her suspected ties to Russia over her tenure as Secretary of [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=184.07999999999998s)]
*  State and some money that her husband Bill Clinton had gotten from a Russian bank. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=190.96s)]
*  Possibly this idea of looking into Trump's fictional ties to Russia was a way to simply [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=196.72s)]
*  deflect. Regardless, Fusion GPS was hired. They immediately hired Christopher Steele to write up [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=201.6s)]
*  this phony dossier of elaborate conspiracy theories involving Trump and Russia. Meanwhile, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=207.6s)]
*  the Hillary Clinton campaign also hired a firm called CrowdStrike, which upon realizing in April [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=214.32s)]
*  and May of 2016 that their emails had been stolen, quickly pointed the blame at Russia in a really [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=222.0s)]
*  dubious sequence of events that I can get into. But that's the origin. Also simultaneously, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=227.68s)]
*  funnily enough, there's also a Ukraine tie because you had people inside of Ukraine who once it was [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=232.56s)]
*  clear that Trump was getting the nomination, were not happy about it because he was openly talking [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=238.0s)]
*  about cooperating with Russia and not getting into a World War III over Ukraine. Now it's [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=242.4s)]
*  documented, and this was in Politico and a few other outlets, that officials at the Ukrainian [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=247.92000000000002s)]
*  embassy started cooperating with the DNC to try to feed them dirt about Trump's then campaign manager, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=252.48s)]
*  Paul Manafort. So Clinton campaign really is the heart of this. Ukraine plays a role too. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=259.92s)]
*  And then very quickly, after the Steele dossier gets underway in June, July 2016, Steele starts [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=265.76s)]
*  passing his conspiracy theories to his contacts at the FBI. And one of the people who was involved [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=272.71999999999997s)]
*  in this happens to be Victoria Nuland because in early July 2016, it's Victoria Nuland who's then [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=279.36s)]
*  serving in the State Department who authorizes an FBI agent to go and meet with Christopher Steele [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=285.76s)]
*  to receive his dossier. Obviously, anytime there's Ukraine involved there, you're going to find the [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=291.12s)]
*  fingerprints of Victoria Nuland. And yeah, there was a political article that has been memory [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=295.44s)]
*  hold right after Donald Trump won the 2016 election that basically said Ukraine made the wrong bet, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=299.68s)]
*  Ukrainians were doing all sorts of things to try and help the Clinton campaign by passing dirt about [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=306.64000000000004s)]
*  Paul Manafort, about other Trump associates because they expected Hillary Clinton to win. They wanted [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=311.92s)]
*  Hillary Clinton to win because obviously they perceived that the Clinton circle was so fanatically [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=316.96000000000004s)]
*  supportive of Ukraine. Just I want to get into the Steele dossier because I do think that's where so [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=322.48s)]
*  much of the most extreme revisionism is now coming from. Before we get there, you mentioned this [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=327.52000000000004s)]
*  question of why they chose Russia. I mean, my view and of course you can only speculate to an [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=333.52s)]
*  extent, but I think there's some things we can know is that if you look back at the part of the [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=339.59999999999997s)]
*  Obama years that was dominated when Hillary Clinton was at the State Department, there was a fixation [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=344.96s)]
*  she had even back then on confronting Russia. When she wrote her book, one of the areas where [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=351.28s)]
*  she was most harshly critical of Obama was his quote unquote failure to confront Russia both in [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=356.08s)]
*  Syria and Ukraine. She of course wanted him to do far more than he in fact did to remove Bashar [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=361.92s)]
*  al-Assad and she wanted Ukraine flooded with lethal arms. So she was always kind of fixated in Russia. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=367.2s)]
*  She actually financed as part of this National Endowment for Democracy and other groups. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=374.32s)]
*  The opposition in Russia helped stimulate a lot of these riots that took place in Russia. That's one [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=379.84000000000003s)]
*  of the reasons Putin hated Hillary was because she had been doing the kind of interference they [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=386.24s)]
*  accused Russia of doing. But I also wonder whether you think that one of the reasons why Russia works [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=389.84s)]
*  so well here is because Russia has always played this role in American political life for decades, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=396.08s)]
*  which you know obviously during the Cold War, which was this was the big evil country that we're [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=402.4s)]
*  supposed to fear. They're doing everything possible to subvert our institutions and undermine [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=407.2s)]
*  our sacred values. Do you think that part of the appeal of Russiagate was that so many Americans [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=413.28s)]
*  over generations had been trained to view Russia as this existential threat that kind of the fear [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=420.08s)]
*  was already built in? Oh absolutely and if you you know read the accounts of the central figures in [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=426.08s)]
*  Russiagate including Jim Clapper who was the former director of national intelligence. He would [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=432.56s)]
*  talk about how he hates the Russians, how they're genetically driven to lie and cheat. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=438.32s)]
*  Many other top officials like Lisa Page who was with the FBI during the Trump Russia investigation [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=444.88s)]
*  or Peter Strzok. They all talked in really derisive terms about Russia so absolutely I think it was [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=450.15999999999997s)]
*  that you know Cold War influence that definitely played into all this absolutely. This revisionism [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=456.0s)]
*  actually infuriates me because of course the attempt by Democrats is that they know that this [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=463.84s)]
*  has become a huge embarrassment. The core conspiracy theories that gave rise to the scandal in the first [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=469.03999999999996s)]
*  place were disproven by the person they deputized to be the supreme authority Robert Mueller [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=475.12s)]
*  and one of the most embarrassing parts of all was the Steele dossier because essentially it turned [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=481.03999999999996s)]
*  out to be a gigantic hoax and there were a couple of attempts very few but one journalistic attempt [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=486.64s)]
*  to hold other journalists accountable for the frauds that they helped spread was when Eric [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=493.59999999999997s)]
*  Wemple did a series on the journalist who most spread the Steele dossier and identified MSNBC's [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=497.59999999999997s)]
*  Rachel Maddow and Natasha Bertrand now at CNN and Rachel Maddow said in response oh I was never really [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=502.71999999999997s)]
*  a big booster of the Steele dossier that really didn't play a role a big role in this scandal. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=508.96s)]
*  That's what they all say now you cannot find anybody anymore who is willing to say they ever [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=513.28s)]
*  were pushing the allegations the core allegations of the Steele dossier. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=520.0799999999999s)]
*  Talk about the role that the Steele dossier actually played in this scandal called Russia Gate [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=525.12s)]
*  because I think this is the thing that has been most deliberately rewritten. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=531.1999999999999s)]
*  People forget that when the Steele dossier was released in January 2017 shortly before Trump took [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=535.68s)]
*  office this was huge news when BuzzFeed news released the entire dossier everybody ran with [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=544.0799999999999s)]
*  this and that set off a series of articles in every single outlet and in fairness to Rachel [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=551.52s)]
*  Maddow she was far from alone this was everybody this was Jane Mayer of the New Yorker wrote a [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=556.8s)]
*  glowing profile of Christopher Steele of this intrepid British spy who came across this [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=562.48s)]
*  damning information about a presidential candidate turned president and just wanted to alert the [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=568.4s)]
*  world to protect democracy. I mean everybody did this New York Times portrayed him as credible [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=572.88s)]
*  anonymous FBI officials laundered claims to reliable stenographers in the media that they've [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=578.64s)]
*  been looking into Steele's claims and they're all checking out when meanwhile they knew that from the [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=584.88s)]
*  start this was a fraud they had spoken very early on to Ivan Denchenko who was Steele's supposed [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=589.5200000000001s)]
*  main source who was Russian but at the time he wasn't even in Russia he was in Washington DC [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=596.08s)]
*  and in his telling the tales that made it into the Steele dossier came from him having drinks [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=601.7600000000001s)]
*  with his friends and just basically making stuff up. The FBI knew all this but gave their media [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=607.5200000000001s)]
*  contacts a completely false picture and these media staffers rather than doing their jobs and [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=613.68s)]
*  subjecting these claims to minimal scrutiny printed all this and treated Steele as if he [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=620.0s)]
*  was credible so this was an across the board failure and yes for Rachel Maddow to claim that [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=624.4799999999999s)]
*  she never took Steele seriously she did an entire special on the Steele dossier it was called the [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=629.12s)]
*  dossier I believe and she you know interviewed all these people you know all Michael Isikoff, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=635.04s)]
*  David Corn of Mother Jones all of them who took the still essay seriously in fact David Corn and [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=640.96s)]
*  Isikoff's book Russian Roulette was pretty much entirely based on the Steele dossier same with [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=646.96s)]
*  Luke Harding who I famously interviewed early on in all this his work was also based on Steele so [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=652.32s)]
*  yeah this was an across the board failure. Yeah we're going to show clips of that interview that [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=657.84s)]
*  you did with Luke Harding because he had the number one best-selling book in the country [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=664.4000000000001s)]
*  purporting to have proven the existence of collusion and you spent the interview pressing [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=669.0400000000001s)]
*  him on just some evidence on which he was relying to make that assertion and he simply could not [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=674.72s)]
*  answer and then finally hung up on you and shamed because he would expose the entire book as a fraud [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=681.76s)]
*  it's really a remarkable interview that I encourage people to watch but we are going to include it [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=687.44s)]
*  in part of what we're doing so one of the things I know there's going to be people who when they [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=692.32s)]
*  hear that the show is about this topic are going to say oh this is old news why are you still focused [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=697.76s)]
*  on this and the reason I find that just so enraging is because it was the issue that [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=703.28s)]
*  dominated our political discourse for three years it was by far the number one story used [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=710.96s)]
*  throughout the 2016 campaign and for at least the first two two and a half years of the Trump [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=715.84s)]
*  presidency and so to pretend that it was just some kind of trivial footnote that wasn't really [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=721.28s)]
*  important is such a form of deceit and historical revisionism that it drives me crazy and one of the [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=726.32s)]
*  things about it is you know it's very hard when I was thinking about talking to you about what I [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=733.2800000000001s)]
*  want to talk to you about there's so many different prongs of it that turned out to be a hoax but one [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=736.6400000000001s)]
*  of the ones that got the most attention and again this has been memory hold is this allegation that [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=741.36s)]
*  the Clinton campaign pushed very aggressively that a secret server had been discovered that permitted [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=746.0s)]
*  the Trump organization to speak to a bank in Russia called Alpha Bank talk about kind of where [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=753.68s)]
*  that came from and how it is that that got debunked in the role that that played in perceptions being [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=759.8399999999999s)]
*  shaped yeah this was rolled out during the 2016 campaign if I remember correctly it I'm forgetting [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=765.76s)]
*  some of the details now because it's been a while but yeah that Hillary Clinton's lawyer went to the [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=774.8s)]
*  FBI that was when he that's what he got prosecuted for by hiding that he was there the FBI after a [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=779.04s)]
*  couple weeks was like this is a joke there's nothing to this and never bothered to tell the public [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=784.16s)]
*  yes so just so thank you for refreshing my memory so just as Hillary Clinton's lawyer Michael Sussman [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=789.8399999999999s)]
*  is feeding this fake claim to the FBI because again the Clinton campaign's goal at this point [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=794.9599999999999s)]
*  is to get the FBI to investigate anything to do with Trump and Russia to make their scam look [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=799.28s)]
*  credible so Sussman this Clinton lawyer had already fed the FBI the claims of another [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=804.24s)]
*  Clinton contractor crowd strike that Russia had stolen the Democratic Party emails the FBI was on [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=809.04s)]
*  that and Sussman decides to double down by also giving him a bunch of so-called data that some [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=814.72s)]
*  researchers working for him had put together showing that there is as you said a secret [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=820.32s)]
*  covert communications channel between the Trump campaign and a Russian bank and the theory here is [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=824.8s)]
*  that the Trump campaign is using the secret channel to like transmit messages or get messages [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=830.24s)]
*  back from the Kremlin and of course the FBI looks at this and concludes at its baseless which we [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=835.36s)]
*  find out way after the fact but meanwhile the Clinton campaign via fusion GPS the firm working [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=840.96s)]
*  for them who are involved in this they're also pushing this on loyal media allies like Franklin [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=847.04s)]
*  Foyer who is now at the Atlantic but then he was with I think Slate and Foyer publishes his big [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=852.4s)]
*  story in Slate and when it comes out what does the Clinton campaign do they put out a press release [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=858.56s)]
*  saying oh my god there's evidence of a secret Trump channel but speaking to a Russian bank [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=863.04s)]
*  what does this mean is this an evidence of a covert operation between Trump and Russia this [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=870.16s)]
*  needs to be investigated this is put out before the election and who signs that press release [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=875.68s)]
*  it's Jake Sullivan who's then a top Hillary advisor who's now our national security advisor [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=880.2399999999999s)]
*  has there been any accountability at all for Jake Sullivan who's supposedly in charge of [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=885.84s)]
*  US national security a pretty big portfolio any accountability at all for him putting out [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=891.2s)]
*  a documented fraud to the public before the 2016 election there's been none at all so that's just [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=895.9200000000001s)]
*  one example of the scam for which there's been no accountability whatsoever and it goes the [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=901.44s)]
*  consequences go far beyond just lying to the public and embarrassing the media we can talk about it [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=908.08s)]
*  yeah no I want to I want to get to that for sure like the not just the harm that it caused but the [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=913.52s)]
*  ongoing current harm that it's causing in terms of the US-Russian relations about the countries the [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS0To4jn38M&t=919.4399999999999s)]
