# How Far Can Israel Go to Defeat Hamas? with Jacob Siegel | SYSTEM UPDATE
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [November 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo)
*  With regard to the current war that the Israelis are now fighting in Gaza, the argument is [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=0.0s)]
*  that, and you referred to it earlier, that look, if the Palestinians want to use violence [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  to attack Israel, whether military targets or in this case as well, civilian targets, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=15.84s)]
*  as they did on October 7th, that means we're going to be in war. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=20.96s)]
*  When we're in war, it means Israel is going to respond as a country at war as it's now [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  doing by bombing Gaza, by invading Gaza. With regard to the Israeli war aims, whatever [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=28.72s)]
*  they are, and I want to get to that, but the ostensible war aim is we're there to destroy [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=34.8s)]
*  Israel, they're to destroy Hamas. Are there any limits at all, moral or legal, that you think are [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=39.44s)]
*  cognizable or valid in terms of how many Palestinians Israel can kill through its [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=47.040000000000006s)]
*  bombs, through its invasion, in order to achieve this goal, or is the sky the limit? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=52.96s)]
*  I mean, I find that to be the wrong question to ask. It's a sort of, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=59.12s)]
*  like a kind of accountants to war. It's just not how war works. Of course, there are moral limits. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=66.24s)]
*  Of course, there are and should be legal limits. And it's pretty clear when Israel opens the [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=74.72s)]
*  humanitarian corridors, when Israel goes to very significant lengths to try and evacuate, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=82.16s)]
*  so that a very, is that this is not indiscriminate carpet bombing. I mean, we've seen examples of [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=89.03999999999999s)]
*  imminent carpet bombing in the very recent, in Syria, for instance, and they didn't involve [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=96.16s)]
*  extensive efforts of the states to actually, you know, deliberate efforts to prevent the [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=104.4s)]
*  evacuation of civilians. What's going on here? The idea that the proper framework to look at [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=111.12s)]
*  this is a sort of, you know, human life being counting, where we look at the number of casualties [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=118.72s)]
*  on both sides. I'm sorry, it's a kind of technocratic fallacy applied to an arena that simply doesn't [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=126.24000000000001s)]
*  work, in which it actually doesn't accord with us of war. That's the law of proportionality. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=136.16s)]
*  Does not refer to, if you should one of us, this is how many of you we can kill, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=145.44s)]
*  what proportionality actually means. It really refers to, you know, it combines [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=151.28s)]
*  ethical considerations about civilian casualties with strategic considerations, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=159.44s)]
*  operational considerations. What is the value of the target? What is the strategic operation, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=164.88s)]
*  operational value of the target? And so it makes more sense to look at it that way, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=170.88s)]
*  rather than to just look at it as a body count on this side and a body count on that side, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=178.32s)]
*  which is why it's so important to not allow it to get to this point, to not set the conditions [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=184.48s)]
*  what U.S. policy in the Middle East has been doing for years now. Look, it's not an accident [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=192.64s)]
*  that shortly after the Biden administration took over in Washington, the first little mini, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=199.04s)]
*  you know, or a recurrence of fighting between Israel and Hamas took place. It's not an accident [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=205.2s)]
*  that the restart of the grand project of U.S. rapprochement with Iran, which is what's really [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=211.92s)]
*  underwriting the current war, it's not an accident that once the Biden administration decided that [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=220.0s)]
*  it was going to abandon the successful Trump approach, which had maintained peace and stability [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=226.64s)]
*  in the region, and return to the failed Obama approach of trying to elevate Iran's status as [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=232.0s)]
*  a regional counterweight and diminish the status of Israel and Saudi Arabia in the region and bring [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=240.16s)]
*  everybody into a concert of powers, including bringing, you know, integrating, which is the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=248.88s)]
*  word used by Blinken recently, integrating the Israelis and the Hezbollah-controlled [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=254.48s)]
*  Lebanese armed forces to the north. It's not an accident that once that framework was restarted, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=263.2s)]
*  there have been a series of wars and an escalating instability leading to catastrophe and tragedy in [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=270.16s)]
*  the region that was actually fairly predictable. I was one of the people who was predicting that, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=278.48s)]
*  which is why I wrote an article in part, in the end of this kind of U.S.-Israeli relationship, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=285.2s)]
*  I could see where things were leading. And now that we're at this point, now that all the meaningful [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=292.16s)]
*  conditions have been put in place that led us to this point, now you've opened up an abyss. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=299.6s)]
*  That's what urban warfare is. Urban warfare is hellish. Urban warfare was hell in Mosul [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=305.76000000000005s)]
*  when the bombing campaign, which included both aerial bombing and significant artillery and [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=313.12s)]
*  indirect fire that leveled the city of Mosul, backed up by Iraqi forces, was sent into Mosul to [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=321.52000000000004s)]
*  depose the Islamic State and liberate Mosul from the Islamic State. That was hell. That was [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=329.44s)]
*  absolute hell. And what's going on in Gaza now is also hell. And the thing that is incumbent on [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=336.96s)]
*  responsible political actors is to prevent that hell from opening up. Once that hell does open [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=345.52s)]
*  up, it's not to say that there are no ethical or legal constraints that can be applied, but [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=352.56s)]
*  I think the framework of looking only at body counts and thinking that that's the correct moral [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=358.24s)]
*  or operational framework, it was wrong when it was applied in Vietnam. It was wrong when it was [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=366.32s)]
*  applied in Afghanistan in the other direction. In other words, just holding up body counts and [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=371.44s)]
*  saying we've killed this many people, therefore our military campaign is successful is a kind of [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=378.24s)]
*  corrupt and bankrupt enterprise. But conversely, just holding up body counts and saying this is a [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=384.4s)]
*  war crime is also a corrupt enterprise. It doesn't reflect the reality of war. And there's one more [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=392.4s)]
*  thing to add to that. Hamas responsibility to the Palestinian people, as Hamas leaders keep saying [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=399.35999999999996s)]
*  in public over and over again, there was a piece in the New York Times yesterday where a senior [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=407.59999999999997s)]
*  leader of Hamas said, we have no responsibility for water, electricity. Our responsibility is [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=413.6s)]
*  perpetual warfare against Israel until we erase the state. This is what a senior Hamas [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=420.48s)]
*  like in the New York Times. Now, the defenders of Hamas abroad have been like to translate [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=425.6s)]
*  its own maximalist disregard for Palestinian citizens and belligerence towards Israel. They [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=434.16s)]
*  translate that into a rationalist technocratic framework. And Robert Malley, the former top level [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=442.08s)]
*  negotiator with both the Obama and Biden administrations, who mysteriously was relieved [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=452.32s)]
*  from his post only a few months before this war started, apparently related to what was [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=458.4s)]
*  subsequently uncovered as a very high level Iranian influence operation at the highest levels of the [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=464.32s)]
*  United States government, Malley famously referred to Hamas as a rational actor, a kind of social [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=471.04s)]
*  movement in the Middle East. And there are people at this very moment who are making the same [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=477.20000000000005s)]
*  arguments about Hamas being essentially just a kind of misunderstood conflict resolution group. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=481.84000000000003s)]
*  So just to be clear, I'm not making that argument, but I do want to just... [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=488.64000000000004s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=491.76s)]
*  I know you weren't going to say that. No, I get it. I understand. But I do want to just go back to [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=492.48s)]
*  that question because I actually don't think... [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=497.68s)]
*  Can I just finish the one point, Glenn? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=500.16s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=502.08000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. Quickly. And let me clarify now, I absolutely was not saying... [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=502.58000000000004s)]
*  No, I know. I didn't mean to suggest you were. I know. I didn't think you were. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=508.96000000000004s)]
*  But there is an important thing to understand here, which is that because Hamas is not accountable [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=512.88s)]
*  to Palestinians, as Hamas leaders say publicly, and the Israeli government is accountable to [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=518.5600000000001s)]
*  Israeli citizens, Israel has an obligation to pursue victory in warfare. This is something I've [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=525.6s)]
*  thought a lot about as an American combat veteran, as an American who participated in catastrophic, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=532.72s)]
*  futile wars where American leaders refused to pursue victory, where American leaders stranded, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=540.64s)]
*  others, including myself, in pointless wars in Afghanistan for two decades, and not only [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=547.52s)]
*  didn't achieve victory, but explicitly scoffed at the end of victory, which is something that [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=555.44s)]
*  both the Bush administration and the Obama administrations did. They treated victory like [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=562.5600000000001s)]
*  an outlaw. But the reason why this is so important is victory is how you secure peace. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=567.28s)]
*  This has been true for thousands of years, and it's true now. Can you sometimes avoid war [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=573.6s)]
*  and secure peace through political negotiations? Yes, you can. And every conceival should be taken [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=581.2s)]
*  to prevent war. But once you're in war, the obligation of the sovereign is to achieve a [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=588.1600000000001s)]
*  victory that restores peace. Hamas doesn't have that obligation. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=595.0400000000001s)]
*  So that's what I want to zero in on. I don't think it's a technocratic question [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=599.44s)]
*  to say how many Palestinians can end up dead at the end of this war for someone to look at this [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=607.2s)]
*  war and say this was a just war. I actually think it's the opposite. I think it's an incredibly [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=614.48s)]
*  technocratic response to say, well, look, there are these doctrines of proportionality and [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=618.8800000000001s)]
*  how you secure victory. We're talking about how many human lives, many, many innocent human lives, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=625.36s)]
*  children, babies are going to end up dead. And what I'm asking you is not as a technocratic [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=631.6s)]
*  question, not according to international law or whatever kind of concepts one can invoke when [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=638.24s)]
*  arguing at the Hague, but as a human being, as somebody who can look at this as a moral actor, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=642.8000000000001s)]
*  is there any number of dead Palestinians that we can reach? 100,000, 500,000, a million, half the [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=648.32s)]
*  population of Gaza, where you would say that simply by virtue of how many Palestinians ended up losing [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=655.6s)]
*  their lives in this war, that this war ended up being unjust? Or as I said at the start, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=663.0400000000001s)]
*  is it just we don't care about that number? That's not a relevant number. How many died? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=668.1600000000001s)]
*  No, I think the evidence shows that the Israelis do care about that number, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=672.24s)]
*  and the Americans obviously care about that number also. Yeah, there is a, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=683.04s)]
*  there is, I wouldn't say there's a number only. I'm not prepared to put a number on this because [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=688.8s)]
*  I think that the important question is, is there deliberate targeting of civilians? Is there an [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=697.52s)]
*  effort to avoid civilian casualties? Who ultimately is placing the civilians? All of these things are [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=706.48s)]
*  important. Are there moral trespasses that Israel could commit? Yes, there are unjustifiable moral [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=714.4s)]
*  trespasses that Israel could potentially commit. I have not seen that so far. I have not seen [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=722.96s)]
*  evidence that the Israeli approach to warfare is the singularly brutal approach that is sometimes [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=730.88s)]
*  ascribed by Israel, the kind of approach that we saw in Syria, for instance. I haven't seen that. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=741.0400000000001s)]
*  That's not to suggest that there are no restraints on how Israel can act. There are absolutely [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=749.5999999999999s)]
*  restraints, and there are restraints coming both from inside Israel and obviously from Washington [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=757.1999999999999s)]
*  as well. I'm not going to try and parse the numbers with you. I don't know which numbers to [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=764.64s)]
*  trust. Even from critics of Israel, I see mild discrepancies in the numbers. I know from past [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=772.16s)]
*  wars between Israel and Hamas that the deliberate policy of Hamas, there's one argument that's made [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=782.0799999999999s)]
*  about the inflation of overall casualties, but there's another very clear policy Hamas has to [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=788.3199999999999s)]
*  identify everyone killed as a civilian. This is written Hamas policy, and you can look up the [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=795.76s)]
*  instructions they had from 2014 about how casualties should be related to the international [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=804.48s)]
*  media, and it makes clear everybody should be identified as a civilian. Gaza is an urban [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=810.72s)]
*  environment. Of course, there are civilians killed. That is absolutely horrific, and that horror is, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=818.32s)]
*  to some extent, inescapable in all war. That's the reality of what war is. The point then [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=830.0s)]
*  is to try and move the war in a way that restores peace without inflicting brutality for the sake [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=837.2s)]
*  of brutality, which is obviously wrong. Just on the question, though, of the moral guidelines [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=845.84s)]
*  that Israel is using with these humanitarian corridors that you mentioned, in the second [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=852.24s)]
*  week of the war, the Israeli defense minister said, we're going to blockade Gaza and not allow food, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=857.44s)]
*  water, medication, or fuel to enter Gaza at all. There was just an American nurse, I don't know [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=862.8000000000001s)]
*  if you saw the interview, who came back. She works with Doctors Without Borders, who said the reason [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=869.2800000000001s)]
*  she was forced to leave Gaza, aside from the fact that her safety could have been endangered, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=874.88s)]
*  is because there's basically a food supply that even if you use the minimal amount of [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=879.84s)]
*  cistizens that the human body needs just to survive, which is 700 calories per day, there was only [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=885.76s)]
*  enough food in all that area to last for two days. The UN says the amount of water and food that are [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=891.12s)]
*  being permitted to enter is about one-tenth of what is necessary. Just for purist assistance, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=899.52s)]
*  there's been reports of doctors amputating limbs that get infected because of dirty drinking water, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=905.76s)]
*  which is then have to be performed without anesthesia. There's a lot of reports that there's [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=911.6s)]
*  nowhere near enough, even just the basic water and food for the civilian population being permitted [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=917.28s)]
*  in after the Israeli defense minister said, we're going to blockade exactly that from entering into [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=922.48s)]
*  Gaza. Do you think all of that comports with whatever constraints, legal or moral, that you [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=927.44s)]
*  think apply to the conflict? There have been statements from a number of Israeli officials [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=933.84s)]
*  that were stupid and blustering. It doesn't mean that that's been policy in every case, [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=942.6400000000001s)]
*  humanitarian hit-robs. I think Jordan was doing humanitarian hit-robs with [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=950.6400000000001s)]
*  the Israeli government. There have been other supplies coming in through the RAFA border. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=956.4799999999999s)]
*  So it's not that no supplies at all have come in. As I'm sure you saw, there's now an agreement [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=963.68s)]
*  that's been reached to do these four humanitarian events. I should point out that, what was it, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=970.4799999999999s)]
*  two and a half weeks ago? We saw, I'm sure your audience saw this as well, all of the reports [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=980.88s)]
*  that the hospitals in Gaza were 24 hours away from running out of fuel. Somehow two and a half weeks [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=987.68s)]
*  later, it seems they still haven't run out of fuel. So it seems that there are supplies that [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=994.64s)]
*  mean that everyone in every place is getting the adequate level of supplies that they need. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=1002.96s)]
*  So the effort to move people to the South and now to have these regular, routine, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=1010.16s)]
*  tactical pauses, as the Israelis are calling them, humanitarian pauses, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=1018.48s)]
*  the US is calling them, may facilitate that more. Look, Glenn, if you or somebody else has an [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=1022.88s)]
*  operational concept for how Israel can destroy Hamas infrastructure, which includes hundreds of [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=1032.24s)]
*  miles of underground networks built beneath a densely populated urban area, tunnel networks [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=1041.28s)]
*  built largely with international aid money, including US money, tunnel networks that were [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=1050.4s)]
*  built over the course of a decade under the supervision of the international community, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=1056.24s)]
*  actually a real concept for a way to do that, that spares civilian life and actually destroys [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=1062.08s)]
*  that infrastructure and delivers a meaningful measure of peace to the Israelis. That's something [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=1073.68s)]
*  I would certainly consider. For right now, it looks to me like we are seeing a fairly standard [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=1080.0s)]
*  by modern standards, that is, urban warfare approach. There's been devastating [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=1089.6s)]
*  but less artillery, it looks like, than was used in US wars accompanied by a ground assault [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=1100.88s)]
*  is placing Israeli soldiers at great risk as they fight in close quarters with [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=1110.08s)]
*  Hamas fighters. I don't know how you can go beyond what's been done at this point in terms of [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=1118.24s)]
*  bringing supplies in, evacuating people to the South, while also maintaining the need for [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=1127.28s)]
*  actual operational victory, which is the only thing that can justify going to war in the first [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=1134.96s)]
*  place. In other words, Israel should not go to war in Gaza if it's not capably committed to securing [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=1140.64s)]
*  that victory that will bring a measure of peace to its own citizens. You don't go to war to provide [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=1148.48s)]
*  humanitarian assistance. I mean, that there's no obligation to civilians once the war has started, [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=1154.5600000000002s)]
*  but that obligation comes under the overall mission of the war, which is that kind of [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=1160.88s)]
*  operational victory. Right. I mean, you can't win wars by starving a population or [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=1167.2s)]
*  having them dieted of a lack of water. I understand the argument that there's a humanitarian [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=1173.7600000000002s)]
*  failure. No, you can't win wars that way. I wouldn't argue that Israel should, nor is that [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=1179.3600000000001s)]
*  what's going on. Now, look, there are laws of siege warfare that are spelled out. People who [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=1187.12s)]
*  are interested in the laws of siege warfare can look them up. Siege warfare, which is considered, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=1192.3999999999999s)]
*  you can go look at the appropriate sources in international law and also from places like the [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=1198.1599999999999s)]
*  Modern Warfare Institute or other defense think tanks that actually do some of this stuff for [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=1202.9599999999998s)]
*  living. You can look at what siege warfare is. It tends to be the sort of conventional. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=1209.6s)]
*  Now, my strategic sense of what Israel should have done is not actually what they're doing right now, [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=1217.1999999999998s)]
*  but I would not have necessarily launched this kind of operation in Gaza. But if we're going to [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=1225.6s)]
*  talk about what's actually happening in the context of international law and specifically [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=1234.0s)]
*  the laws on siege warfare, then there are relevant and applicable statutes here. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=586kSxw9RPo&t=1238.64s)]
