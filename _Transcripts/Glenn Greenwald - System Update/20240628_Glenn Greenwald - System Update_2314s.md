# SCOTUS Protects Biden Administration's Social Media Censorship Program from Review
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [June 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg)
*  One of the topics that we have covered most on this program ever since it launched is [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=0.0s)]
*  the growing means and prongs of censorship that Western governments and the United States [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=12.6s)]
*  government as well have been creating and employing with the primary intention of controlling [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=19.52s)]
*  and constraining the flow of information over the Internet and particularly big tech platforms [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=24.96s)]
*  where more and more Americans than ever before and more and more Westerners than ever before [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=30.48s)]
*  are getting their sources of information so that if you can control that and commandeer [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=35.72s)]
*  it and if the government can dictate to big tech companies what they should and should [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=40.160000000000004s)]
*  not allow on those platforms that gives them an extraordinary power. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=44.94s)]
*  In fact, it's the exact opposite of the power the Internet was supposed to promise the ability [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=49.44s)]
*  for citizens to be free to access information more easily than ever. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=54.32s)]
*  If the government is allowed to dictate and coerce companies to ban dissent and only allow [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=58.2s)]
*  government approved narratives which is what we're getting closer and closer to all the [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=64.24s)]
*  time the Internet goes from an unprecedented tool of liberation to an unprecedented tool [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=67.52s)]
*  of coercion and control and one of the most disturbing features of this new censorship [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=73.88s)]
*  regime, a formal censorship regime, is the way in which the Biden administration created [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=83.03999999999999s)]
*  a system for just picking up the phone and calling the top levels of Facebook and Google [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=87.52s)]
*  and X and TikTok and instructing them what they want censored and implicitly and sometimes [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=94.36s)]
*  explicitly threatening them with punishments if they fail to comply. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=101.22s)]
*  We've been covering that for years. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=106.36s)]
*  The Twitter files broke open a whole new way of looking at this and as a result the plaintiffs [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=107.75999999999999s)]
*  various American citizens who including major scientists and doctors at the leading institutions [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=113.22s)]
*  who had a dissident view on COVID or people who were concerned about the efficacy or safety [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=120.41999999999999s)]
*  of the vaccine who expressed different views on masks and school shutdowns or had different [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=126.66s)]
*  views on the 2020 election and its integrity or who dissented on the war in Ukraine have been [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=132.9s)]
*  systematically censored on the Internet over many years and it turns out that in many cases [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=139.86s)]
*  that's because the government at the highest levels was directing those big tech platforms [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=146.74s)]
*  to censor and the power of the U.S. government is so great that it is almost impossible to [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=152.34s)]
*  resist it because when the government picks up the phone and comes knocking through the FBI [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=159.54000000000002s)]
*  or the CDC or the CIA or the National Institute of Health and says these posts are wrong and we [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=164.9s)]
*  believe that they should be taken down and harassed and badgers the big tech company until they do it [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=172.82s)]
*  obviously that becomes a form of government censorship and that is what for federal courts [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=177.62s)]
*  who have looked at this issue for federal judges rather who have looked at this issue when it was [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=184.1s)]
*  when a lawsuit was brought against the Biden administration claiming violations of the First [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=190.82s)]
*  Amendment free speech right plaintiffs who were censored in exactly the ways I just described [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=194.9s)]
*  who claimed that their government was abridging the First Amendment right of free speech a district [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=200.18s)]
*  court judge found in favor of the plaintiffs wrote a very lengthy and aggressive opinion [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=205.06s)]
*  denouncing what the Biden administration was doing as a direct assault on free on free speech [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=215.14s)]
*  and the government the Biden administration lost and then appealed it to the fifth circuit [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=221.7s)]
*  where a three-judge panel unanimously affirmed most of what the district court had ruled also [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=227.62s)]
*  found not only that it was a violation of the First Amendment but one of the gravest in the history [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=233.54s)]
*  of the court and as a result can approved of the injunction that the district court have imposed on [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=237.7s)]
*  the Biden administration to prevent it from picking up the phone and calling big tack [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=244.82s)]
*  but when the supreme court decided that it would take this case and review this question it froze [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=249.22s)]
*  the injunction pending the supreme court's ruling and back in march the supreme court held oral [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=255.78s)]
*  argument between the lawyers for the plaintiffs and the lawyers for the government and we reported [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=262.42s)]
*  on what happened at the oral argument we played some extra extra of it and it seemed very clear [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=268.74s)]
*  that a majority of the court seemed inclined to toss this lawsuit out not by ruling out what [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=274.34s)]
*  the Biden administration did was constitutional or legal or appropriate but instead by just simply [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=280.82s)]
*  finding a way to refuse to rule on the question at all by embracing some more technical or [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=287.21999999999997s)]
*  legalistic reason as to why that case should never have been in court in the first place [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=294.42s)]
*  and that's exactly what the supreme court this week did in a six to three ruling a majority [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=299.06s)]
*  ruling written by Amy Coney Barrett and that was joined by Justice Roberts and Justice Kavanaugh [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=305.86s)]
*  so those were the three conservative judges Roberts Amy Coney Barrett and Kavanaugh joined by [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=317.86s)]
*  joined by Kagan Sotomayor and and Jackson that formed the six member majority and Amy Coney [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=323.86s)]
*  Barrett wrote the opinion of the court that all the six judges signed on to the three judges who [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=334.26s)]
*  dissented were Alito Thomas and Gorsuch Alito wrote the dissenting opinion but the majority of the [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=340.9s)]
*  court decided to reverse the lower court rulings against the Biden administration to throw the [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=345.62s)]
*  case out completely not because they ruled that the Biden administration's actions were [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=351.14s)]
*  constitutional but simply said in essence these plaintiffs have no standing to bring this suit [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=358.58s)]
*  because they cannot prove definitively that the reason they ended up being censored online [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=364.58s)]
*  was because the government pressured big tech companies to do so even if they said you can [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=373.06s)]
*  prove that the government pressured big tech companies to censor the exact kind of speech [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=379.46s)]
*  these plaintiffs were expressing and you can prove that and they did prove that because said the [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=384.73999999999995s)]
*  court you can't prove a direct link between the government action and the censorship [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=391.14s)]
*  hypothesizing that perhaps it was just the big tech companies on their own deciding to censor [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=396.74s)]
*  they couldn't prove that it was the government that did anything against them and therefore [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=402.65999999999997s)]
*  they have no standing to ask the court to rule on its constitutionality this is a common way the [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=406.5s)]
*  supreme court evades having to rule on government conduct that they don't actually want to nullify [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=411.22s)]
*  they did it all the time through the war on terror as we'll show you when people wanted to contest [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=419.06s)]
*  the constitutionality of how the government was spying on american citizens without warrants [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=425.62s)]
*  the court would say oh well it's a secret who the government is spying on we can't force them [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=430.98s)]
*  to give us their list because that would jeopardize national security and because it's all done in the [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=436.42s)]
*  secret the plaintiffs can't prove for sure that they were targets of warrantless surveillance and [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=441.06s)]
*  therefore their lawsuit alleging a violation of the fourth amendment has to be thrown out not [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=448.66s)]
*  because we think the government spying is constitutional but because these plaintiffs can't prove for sure [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=454.1s)]
*  that they were victims of that government action and i'll explain a little bit more about how that [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=459.62s)]
*  works and what that doctrine is and actually why it's an important doctrine despite the fact that [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=464.66s)]
*  it's often abused by courts to avoid ruling as it was abused here but before getting to that let [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=470.26000000000005s)]
*  me just show you what the majority opinion began by acknowledging before getting to its ruling this [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=476.58000000000004s)]
*  is what Amy Coney Barrett wrote in the majority opinion quote during the 2020 election season [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=483.22s)]
*  yeah we can just show the title first there you see the title supreme court of the united states [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=490.90000000000003s)]
*  it's titled murphy versus missouri because it was originally brought by the attorney attorney general [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=495.62s)]
*  of missouri and louisiana against a variety of different biden officials including murphy who was [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=502.74s)]
*  the sergeant general at the time he was very active in pressuring big tech companies to [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=509.86s)]
*  censor dissent on covet and here's what the majority ruling acknowledged quote during the [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=515.5400000000001s)]
*  2020 election season and the covet 19 pandemic social media platforms frequently removed demoted [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=522.5s)]
*  or fact-checked posts containing allegedly false or misleading information at the same time [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=529.62s)]
*  federal officials concerned about the spread of quote misinformation on social media [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=535.38s)]
*  communicated extensively with the platforms about their content moderation efforts [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=541.38s)]
*  the plaintiffs two states and five social media users sued dozens of executive branch officials [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=546.9s)]
*  and agencies alleging that they pressured the platforms to suppress protected speech [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=552.58s)]
*  in violation of the first amendment the fifth circuit agreed concluding that the officials [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=557.38s)]
*  communications rendered them responsible for the private platforms moderation decision and then [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=563.38s)]
*  affirmed a sweeping preliminary injunction [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=568.98s)]
*  and then the supreme court goes on to say quote the fifth circuit was wrong to do so [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=574.8199999999999s)]
*  to establish standing the plaintiffs must demonstrate a substantial risk that in the [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=580.18s)]
*  near future they will suffer an injury that is traceable to a government defendant and [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=585.78s)]
*  regressible by the injunction they seek because no plaintiff has carried that burden none has [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=591.14s)]
*  standing to seek your preliminary injunction in other words even if you can prove that in the [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=597.22s)]
*  past you were subject to government censorship then you can seek other remedies but what the court [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=602.1800000000001s)]
*  what the plaintiffs were seeking here and what the court issued was an injunction barring the [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=611.22s)]
*  government in the future from continuing to coerce big tech companies to censor and because these [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=615.46s)]
*  plaintiffs couldn't prove that in the future they will be victimized by the government and its [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=621.3000000000001s)]
*  actions they have no right to seek a injunction governing the actions in the future now that might [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=626.5s)]
*  all sound very technical and annoying and frustrating but it is actually an important limitation [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=633.78s)]
*  on the power of the judicial branch to only adjudicate cases not just that raise abstract [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=640.98s)]
*  issues you can't just say i don't like what the government's doing here i'm a citizen i'm going [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=649.62s)]
*  to sue and ask the court to rule on the constitutionality the only time they're [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=653.22s)]
*  allowed to rule on anything is when there's an actual conflict between the plaintiffs and [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=656.9s)]
*  defendants when there's an actual relationship between the two where harm can be shown was done [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=662.1800000000001s)]
*  to one side by the other it's called the case or controversy limitation and it comes from article [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=668.5s)]
*  three section three or section two rather of the constitution article article one is what defines [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=674.74s)]
*  the legislative power article two of the constitution is what defines the executive [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=681.22s)]
*  branch's power and article three is what defines the power of the courts of the judicial branch [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=686.34s)]
*  and article three section two says quote the judicial power shall extend to all cases [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=691.86s)]
*  to controversies to which the united states shall be a party to controversies between two or more [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=697.94s)]
*  states between a state and citizen of another state between citizens of different states [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=702.58s)]
*  between citizens of the same state and between a state or the citizens thereof and foreign states [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=708.34s)]
*  citizens or subjects so it's saying the jitters branch can't just go around and rolling on any [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=714.34s)]
*  question there has to be a case or controversy between those kinds of parties and what it's [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=720.34s)]
*  really doing is it's defining when a federal court has jurisdiction as opposed to a state court [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=727.7s)]
*  so if two citizens of the same state sue one another and there's no federal question they're [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=733.22s)]

*  enough interest to confer standing is the requirement that a real issue be presented [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=797.54s)]
*  as contrasted with speculative abstract hypothetical or moot issues it has long been the [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=803.06s)]
*  court's quote considered practice not to decide abstract hypothetical or continued questions [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=809.86s)]

*  fact so what they're saying is if you see your government enacting law that you don't like or [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=888.9s)]
*  that you believe is illegal you can't just run to a court and ask a court to just kind of issue an [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=893.54s)]
*  advisory opinion on whether what the government did is legal that's an that's beyond the limits [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=898.5799999999999s)]
*  of a court's power under the constitution the only thing a court can do is see a case or controversy [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=903.78s)]
*  between a plaintiff and a defendant or in criminal cases between the state and the defendant [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=910.8199999999999s)]
*  and then rule based on an actual conflict between the two parties and then they set precedent for [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=915.22s)]
*  how other cases like it are to be decided so that's a real important limitation on the court's power [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=921.38s)]
*  you don't want a court just being this floating arbiter of deciding legality now here's what [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=928.58s)]
*  amy coney barrett went on to argue as to why that kind of standing is lacking here we showed that [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=936.02s)]
*  already that [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=943.54s)]
*  so here's what she said quote following a grant of panel rehearing the fifth circuit affirmed [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=946.9s)]
*  in part and reversed in part the district court's ruling it first held that the individual plaintiffs [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=953.2199999999999s)]
*  had article three standing to seek injunctive relief reasoning that the social media companies [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=959.06s)]
*  had suppressed the plaintiff's speech in the past and were likely to do so again in the future [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=964.26s)]
*  in the future and that both of these injuries were quote traceable to government coerced [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=970.02s)]
*  enforcement of the platform's policy and quote readjust redressable by an injunction against [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=974.98s)]
*  government officials it went on the court also concluded the lower court the district the [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=981.0600000000001s)]
*  appellate court the appellate court also concluded that the states had standing both because the [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=986.02s)]
*  platforms had restricted the post of individual state officials and because the states have the [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=991.5400000000001s)]
*  quote right to listen to their citizens on social media and then here's what amy coney barrett said [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=996.34s)]
*  that a lot of media accounts deliberately ignored a lot of media articles tried to pretend [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1002.6600000000001s)]
*  that this is a huge victory for the biden administration because the court ruled that [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1010.74s)]
*  they weren't really censoring the court refused to rule on that question and as amy coney barrett [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1015.0600000000001s)]
*  here says in this next passage she said we begin and end with the question of standing [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1022.42s)]
*  meaning once we find that the plaintiffs have no standing to bring this lawsuit [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1031.94s)]
*  that's the end of the case we cannot go on and then decide whether or not what the biden [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1036.18s)]
*  administration did here is constitutional and because they found no standing they did not in [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1040.8999999999999s)]
*  fact reach the merits of the case she says quote at this stage neither the individual nor the state [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1045.86s)]
*  plaintiffs have established standing to seek an injunction against any defendant we for therefore [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1051.7s)]
*  lack jurisdiction to reach the merits of the dispute a proper case or controversy that was the [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1057.8600000000001s)]
*  article three limitation i just told you about exists only when at least one plaintiff quote [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1064.98s)]
*  establishes that she has standing to sue quoting a supreme court case from 2019 she must show that [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1070.1000000000001s)]
*  she has suffered and this is amy coney barrett not using he as a generic generic pronoun but she just [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1077.62s)]
*  referring to a plaintiff quote she must show that she has suffered or will suffer an injury that is [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1085.54s)]
*  quote concrete particularized and actual or imminent fairly traceable to the challenge action [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1092.1799999999998s)]
*  and regressible by a favorable ruling and she's quoting there the case of james clasper versus [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1098.82s)]
*  amnesty international which is one of those war and terror cases where amnesty international [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1107.54s)]
*  sued james clapper arguing that his actions in the war on terror were unconstitutional [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1114.02s)]
*  and the supreme court sidestepped that question as well by concluding that neither amnesty nor the [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1120.82s)]
*  american citizens suing james clapper could prove that they were actually harmed by the program [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1127.3s)]
*  james clapper was implementing and overseeing which i believe was the domestic spying program [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1132.26s)]
*  in this case and we'll show you that in just a minute this is how the court so often avoids [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1138.74s)]
*  ruling on these questions and so the supreme court is citing that precedent where they protected the [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1144.18s)]
*  obama administration james clapper from a ruling on whether their domestic spying without warrants was [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1149.3s)]
*  not constitutional the court goes on quote these requirements help ensure that the plaintiff has [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1155.54s)]
*  such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to warrant invocation of federal [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1162.66s)]
*  court jurisdiction quote the plaintiffs without any concrete link between their injuries and the [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1167.78s)]
*  defendant's conduct asked us to conduct a review of the years-long communications between dozens [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1174.02s)]
*  of federal officials across different agencies with different social media platforms about [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1179.54s)]
*  different topics this court standing doctrine prevents us from quote exercising such general [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1185.3s)]
*  legal oversight of the other branches of government we therefore reverse the judgment [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1192.02s)]
*  of the fifth circuit and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1196.66s)]
*  so i just want to be very clear that this court contrary to what a lot of [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1202.98s)]
*  sort of liberal pundits and corporate media outlets were trying to imply [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1207.06s)]
*  well knowing it wasn't true this court did not rule in favor of the biden administration in the [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1212.34s)]
*  sense that they said they did nothing wrong or that their pressure and coercion of big tech platforms [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1217.54s)]
*  was not unconstitutional that's they didn't rule on those questions they simply said the plaintiffs [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1226.1s)]
*  did not offer enough evidence to prove that they were directly harmed by the government [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1232.34s)]
*  factions that that was the reason they were being censored the court reason look facebook google [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1237.78s)]
*  twitter tiktok they censor all the time on their own and while it probably is the case or seems [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1243.54s)]
*  likely that the people suing here were censored because of government pressure because they had [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1250.5s)]
*  evidence that the biden administration was saying you have to censor exactly the sort of opinions [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1258.26s)]
*  that these specific medical experts were expressing and then facebook right after that call would then [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1264.6599999999999s)]
*  go and remove a post or ban the person even though it's likely said the majority opinion the [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1271.14s)]
*  individuals could not prove that it was the government that was caused their censorship [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1277.94s)]
*  maybe it was just big tech like acting on their own even though at the very time they did it [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1283.94s)]
*  they were being harangued and cajoled by the biden administration and they also said the majority [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1287.7800000000002s)]
*  couldn't prove that they were likely to be censored that way in the future and therefore [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1293.38s)]
*  could not ask for an injunction maybe they can ask for other sorts of remedies but not an injunction [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1299.3s)]
*  injunction is only when an unconstitutional or a legal act is likely to occur in the future and then [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1304.1799999999998s)]
*  that way you can join the party from continuing in it so it's an incredibly stretched and dubious [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1310.8999999999999s)]
*  and just facially light attempt to avoid reaching a ruling at all and this is what we told you after [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1322.34s)]
*  we heard the oral argument we thought was likely to have what we thought was what the Supreme Court [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1330.4199999999998s)]
*  was likely to do just refuse on standing grounds to even consider this and as a result allow this [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1334.6599999999999s)]
*  censorship regime that the lower court said was among the gravest assault on the first amendment [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1341.54s)]
*  the first amendment in the history of the courts that they've seen allow that censorship regime to [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1347.38s)]
*  continue now the dissent was written as i said by justice Alito he was joined by Clarence Thomas [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1352.74s)]
*  and justice Gorsuch and the dissent was very powerful in explaining why the majority's ruling [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1360.3400000000001s)]
*  was not only utterly wrong on the legal issues but also incredibly dangerous in its outcome [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1369.94s)]
*  so i just want to read you some of this so you understand what the implications of this is now [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1377.38s)]
*  here's Alito's dissent quote if the lower court's assessment of the voluminous record is correct [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1383.46s)]
*  this is one of the most important free speech cases to reach this court in years meaning this [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1391.38s)]
*  is not just a regular claim that the government violated the constitution he used the exact [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1398.5s)]
*  language that both lower courts used that this is one of the gravest assaults on free speech [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1403.78s)]
*  in years and then he went on to explain why quote our country's response to the COVID-19 pandemic [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1410.58s)]
*  was and remains a matter of enormous medical social political geopolitical and economic importance [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1419.94s)]
*  and our dedication to a free marketplace of ideas demands that dissenting views on such matter be [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1427.7s)]
*  allowed i assume that a fair portion of what social media users had to say about COVID-19 [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1434.34s)]
*  and the pandemic was of little lasting value some was undoubtedly untrue or misleading [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1441.54s)]
*  and some may have been downright dangerous but we also know that valuable speech was also suppressed [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1446.8999999999999s)]
*  of course purely private entities like newspapers are not subject to the first amendment as a result [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1454.42s)]
*  they may publish or decline to publish whatever they wish but government officials may not coerce [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1459.94s)]
*  private entities to censor speech see the national rifle association of america versus vula now let [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1466.74s)]
*  me just note what this case is and why it's so interesting that just the lito is citing it [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1474.98s)]
*  the administration of andrew cuomo when he was governor of new york attempted in multiple ways [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1483.94s)]
*  to try to destroy the nra because obviously the democratic governor of new york dislikes [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1489.06s)]
*  to put it mildly the ideology and political gender of the n and the nra and so the government andrew [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1495.8600000000001s)]
*  cuomo was threatening all sorts of private actors that you will be punished if you have anything to [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1502.9s)]
*  do with the nra and this conduct was so extreme that it was the aclu that agreed to represent the [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1509.06s)]
*  nra the aclu represented the nra in this case because the aclu believed that andrew cuomo's [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1516.82s)]
*  conduct against the nra was so obviously an attack on free speech even though the government [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctNfALn9feg&t=1524.5s)]
