# Pulitzer Prize Winner Mosab Abu Toha Describes Atrocities in Gaza
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [June 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk)
*  As we just noted, Mosab Abut Toa is a Palestinian writer. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=0.0s)]
*  He's a poet, a scholar, and has worked hard on various libraries as well in Gaza. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  He was in Gaza when Israel began its massive assault after the October 7th attack and he [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=15.58s)]
*  was able to flee with his wife and young daughter who's an American citizen, though just barely [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=20.1s)]
*  he was there for about two months when he was able to flee. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=24.62s)]
*  He is now a Pulitzer Prize winner as a result of a series of essays he wrote last year in [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=27.1s)]
*  The New Yorker that chronicles and powerfully expresses the extreme human suffering and [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=31.36s)]
*  humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=35.74s)]
*  We are delighted to have him with us tonight to understand what has been happening there. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=38.18s)]
*  Mosab, it's great to see you. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=42.900000000000006s)]
*  Thank you so much for taking the time to talk to us. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=44.06s)]
*  Of course, it is my great pleasure. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=47.620000000000005s)]
*  Thank you so much, Glenn, for having me. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=49.7s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=51.660000000000004s)]
*  So I wish we were meeting under better circumstances. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=52.660000000000004s)]
*  I wish we had something less depressing and horrific to talk about, but the world is what [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=54.74s)]
*  it is. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=60.5s)]
*  So I just want to get a little bit of understanding from you since one of the things that you [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=61.5s)]
*  do is convey thoughts and emotions in words as a poet, as a writer, obviously now widely [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=67.78s)]
*  recognized one. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=73.66s)]
*  As somebody who's lived in Gaza, it's not new to you to be bombed by the Israelis. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=77.02000000000001s)]
*  Israel has been bombing Gaza, killing civilians many, many times over many, many years. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=82.34s)]
*  But I think it was very obvious for a variety of reasons, not just October 7th, but the [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=87.18s)]
*  composition of the current Israeli government, the obvious support the world was going to [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=90.62s)]
*  give them, that this is going to be far worse than quickly it turned out to be. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=94.06s)]
*  So you were in Gaza for about two months before you were able to get out. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=98.42s)]
*  What were those two months like for you and your family? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=103.14s)]
*  First of all, it is important to note that I was born in a refugee camp. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=108.38s)]
*  My parents were born themselves in refugee camps. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=113.33999999999999s)]
*  My grandparents on both sides were expelled from Yaffa in 1948. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=116.25999999999999s)]
*  So I lived in Gaza all my life and I was a witness and a survivor of so many Israeli [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=121.44s)]
*  assaults. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=127.06s)]
*  I was wounded in one of the airstrikes in 2008, 2009. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=128.74s)]
*  I survived by chance and I still have the wounds in my body, in my neck, in my forehead, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=133.45999999999998s)]
*  in my cheeks and in my shoulder. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=138.42s)]
*  So surviving the genocide in Gaza was not the first time I survived the Israeli aggression. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=141.22s)]
*  In fact, I was in the United States between 2022, 2023. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=149.5s)]
*  I returned to Gaza in 2023 after I finished my MFA from Syracuse University and I then [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=155.42s)]
*  traveled to the United States again for a literary festival, Palestine Rights, which [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=162.5s)]
*  was held at UPenn in Pennsylvania, Philadelphia. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=167.94s)]
*  And I returned to Gaza 10 days before October 7th and I resumed my work as a teacher in [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=172.74s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=181.94s)]
*  Can I just interrupt you there because that literary festival that you're referring to [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=182.94s)]
*  shortly before October 7th, as I recall, there was a gigantic movement, this was before [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=188.82s)]
*  October 7th, to have that canceled simply on the grounds that people like you and other [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=195.1s)]
*  Palestinians were participating and speaking critically of Israel. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=200.18s)]
*  Can you just talk a little bit about that and then I want to get back to what the experience [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=203.66s)]
*  was in Gaza? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=206.85999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=207.85999999999999s)]
*  I would like to say, Glenn, that the criticism that me or other people are critical of Israel [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=208.85999999999999s)]
*  is not true. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=217.74s)]
*  We are not critical of Israel. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=219.66s)]
*  All we are doing is exposing the crimes that Israel has been committing, whether it's in [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=220.66s)]
*  the Gaza Strip or in the West Bank. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=224.58s)]
*  So I don't care if it was a different country, if it was a different people. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=226.66s)]
*  I would still do the same thing because this is happening to me and to my people, to my [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=231.22s)]
*  parents, to my children, and also to my grandchildren. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=234.5s)]
*  And so it is not that people in Palestine or Palestinians or even pro-Palestinian people [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=238.5s)]
*  who care about human rights, it's not that they are critical of Israel or whatever you [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=243.82000000000002s)]
*  call it. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=247.98000000000002s)]
*  It's that people are talking and advocating on behalf of the people who have been living [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=248.98000000000002s)]
*  under occupation for 77 years. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=253.06s)]
*  And this is perceived as a crime. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=256.7s)]
*  When you talk about crimes that are committed by a state that has been created in 1948 and [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=259.38s)]
*  that's been funded by, unfortunately, Western countries and also the United States until [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=264.94s)]
*  today, even as they are committing an ongoing genocide. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=269.86s)]
*  So it is shameful that the festival, some of the participants were cancelled or they [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=273.58s)]
*  were not permitted to be on campus at the University of Pennsylvania in September 2023. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=280.18s)]
*  But here we are in 2025. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=290.06s)]
*  Palestinian people, Palestinian writers, Palestinian journalists have been the main target of the [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=293.58s)]
*  Israeli airstrikes. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=298.09999999999997s)]
*  And Palestinian activists and pro-Palestinian activists have been cancelled from so many [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=299.54s)]
*  places, even artists, even singers. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=304.74s)]
*  They were cancelled from big events because of what they say about the Palestinian people [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=307.74s)]
*  and their right to exist and to exist with dignity. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=312.22s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, we covered so many censorship-based reactions to suppress pro-Palestinian speech, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=315.90000000000003s)]
*  but I just thought it was important to remember that that's been happening in the United States [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=323.42s)]
*  well before October 7th and in fact, just a week or two before at one of our great universities, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=327.1s)]
*  the University of Pennsylvania, where apparently just the mere presence of Palestinian voices [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=332.02000000000004s)]
*  in a view of a lot of people, justified trying to get the entire event cancelled and ended [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=336.74s)]
*  up getting some of the people banned. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=341.38s)]
*  All right, so you went back to Gaza after that event and shortly thereafter, the October [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=342.86s)]
*  7th attack happened and then followed by this massive Israeli air assault on Gaza, unlike, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=348.5s)]
*  I think, anything that has happened in Gaza for a long time, despite how terrible and [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=354.26000000000005s)]
*  fatal so many of the other ones were. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=359.14000000000004s)]
*  Just in your own words, what was that like just to be constantly surrounded by death, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=361.42s)]
*  by the risk of death, by the fear that you would go to bed and not wake up? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=366.34000000000003s)]
*  How did you navigate that? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=371.54s)]
*  So it is important, Glenn, to note that Palestinians in Gaza have been massacred by the Israeli [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=375.74s)]
*  forces, the Israeli army, without, I mean, I was 21 years old. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=381.1s)]
*  Now, I'm sorry, I was 31 years old when I left Gaza for the last time. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=386.14s)]
*  I've never before October 7th, I've never in my life saw an Israeli, seen an Israeli [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=391.82s)]
*  soldier. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=397.26s)]
*  Israel was bombing us from the sky. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=398.26s)]
*  Israel was firing at us from gunboats and warships in the sea, in our sea, just seven [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=400.06s)]
*  or eight nautical miles off our shore. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=405.7s)]
*  They were shooting at us. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=408.02s)]
*  They were killing us. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=409.1s)]
*  They were dropping bombs on us without us seeing. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=409.98s)]
*  I've never seen an Israeli, not even an Israeli soldier, never seen an Israeli soldier, an [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=412.66s)]
*  Israeli civilian, you know, in my life. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=416.26s)]
*  So we have been killed. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=419.38s)]
*  We have been abducted. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=420.74s)]
*  We have been injured. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=422.18s)]
*  Our houses have been destroyed on top of our families without us seeing who these people [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=423.26s)]
*  are who have been killing us without seeing. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=429.5s)]
*  I mean, they see us from on a screen. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=431.5s)]
*  They see us as as as dots, black and white dots moving on the ground or maybe striking [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=434.7s)]
*  structures on the on the ground. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=439.86s)]
*  And lately they have been filming us, you know, through their drones, people who are [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=442.98s)]
*  trying to get aid. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=447.34000000000003s)]
*  You know, there are some so many videos of people who try to go back to their homes to [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=448.78000000000003s)]
*  collect food. And then there are there is a footage of an Israeli drone missile hitting [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=452.54s)]
*  them and killing them. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=457.34000000000003s)]
*  So I lived in Gaza all my life and and I've never seen an Israeli soldier. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=459.06s)]
*  I was I was wounded. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=464.46000000000004s)]
*  I don't know, you know, whether that soldier knew or whether that Israeli pilot who dropped [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=465.82s)]
*  the bomb in 2009, he knew that they killed seven people in that airstrike and they wounded [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=470.97999999999996s)]
*  a 16 year old child who became a Pulitzer Prize winning author. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=476.38s)]
*  So when when when Israel attacked Gaza, it's not only an military attack. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=483.58s)]
*  Israel did not only drop bombs. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=490.02s)]
*  They did not fire, you know, bullets at people and armed people. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=492.02s)]
*  But they also shut off electricity, shut off water, shut off, you know, food trucks. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=498.97999999999996s)]
*  They they control everything. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=504.53999999999996s)]
*  Right. So it's not like Israel just attacked Gaza militarily. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=506.97999999999996s)]
*  No, they they blocked everything. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=510.62s)]
*  Even as we are talking, people do not have not only enough food, because we all we all [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=512.74s)]
*  always talk about the lack of food, the lack of water, the lack of shelter. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=518.74s)]
*  But there's lack of medicine. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=522.9s)]
*  One of the one of the relatives of my brother in law, who was wounded in a strike that [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=524.98s)]
*  killed his brother 20 days ago, and I wrote about him in my last piece in the New Yorker. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=529.26s)]
*  He was at the hospital at the hospital and the shrapnel covered his body and he was [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=535.82s)]
*  he was his his arms and his body was wrapped in gauze. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=541.7s)]
*  And he complained to the doctors that he has some pain in his body. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=544.86s)]
*  And you know what they gave him? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=548.18s)]
*  They gave him something like Tylenol, something that you get, you know, you take when you [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=550.5799999999999s)]
*  have a headache. There is no medicine in Gaza. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=555.42s)]
*  And even there is no healthy food. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=557.9399999999999s)]
*  The kind of food that is entering Gaza is canned food. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=559.34s)]
*  You know, it's it's canned beans, canned peas, sugar, frying oil. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=562.02s)]
*  There is no fresh food, not only for people to grow normally, but even for those that [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=566.98s)]
*  thousand that dozens of thousands of Palestinians who were injured. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=571.62s)]
*  There is no healthy food, the fresh food, like vegetable, like fruit, like meat for [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=575.86s)]
*  them to heal. So people in Gaza are dying several, several, several times. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=579.62s)]
*  And if you allow me, I mean, because we now we are talking today in Gaza, it's it's [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=586.3000000000001s)]
*  2 20 a.m. It's Thursday today, June 26th, as we are talking just in the past, our [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=591.46s)]
*  Israel bomb attempt in Khan Yunis killing five people. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=597.98s)]
*  And before that, yesterday, they killed one hundred and one people all over the [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=602.22s)]
*  gastrop of these people was a whole family from a family. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=608.14s)]
*  And I wrote their names on my social media. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=613.54s)]
*  I mean, we don't get to know the names of these people who are killed. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=617.18s)]
*  The father is named Salah, his wife is Salwa. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=620.38s)]
*  Their children are Ahmed, a son, Abdullah, a son, Mustafa, a son, a daughter. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=624.18s)]
*  And and the brother of the father was killed. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=629.9s)]
*  And then there was a nephew. So the Israel attack on Gaza is not by killing them, but [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=631.86s)]
*  even by bombing the Internet, bombing the electricity, not allowing people even to [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=637.5799999999999s)]
*  report. So there is difficulty in reporting not only by not allowing journalists, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=644.6999999999999s)]
*  international journalists, you know, to go to Gaza, but they are also bombing, you [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=649.02s)]
*  know, every every means that Palestinians can use to report on their miseries and [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=654.2199999999999s)]
*  their suffering and their demise. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=659.14s)]
*  So that's why it is very important to talk about what's happening in Gaza and also [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=660.78s)]
*  in Palestine every day. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=665.34s)]
*  Israel is killing people in Gaza, in Palestine every day. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=667.58s)]
*  That's why every day we have to speak to talk about Palestine. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=671.0600000000001s)]
*  You know, one of the and there's a lot of obviously we could talk about. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=677.02s)]
*  We cover a lot the atrocities pretty much on a daily basis or close to it on the [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=680.78s)]
*  show. But but I do want to get to that as well. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=686.54s)]
*  Just some of the more recent things that have been happening that, as I said, have [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=689.5799999999999s)]
*  been even more covered up than usual, not just by the lack of media in Gaza, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=691.9s)]
*  international media, but in the lack of Internet, but also by so much attention [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=695.2199999999999s)]
*  paid to what was happening in Iran. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=699.06s)]
*  But one of the things I'd like to ask you is one of the ways that I had John [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=702.02s)]
*  Mearsheim around my show yesterday and we were both talking about how is it that [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=706.9399999999999s)]
*  the world can watch what's going on in Gaza, even to the extent that we get to see [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=711.18s)]
*  it. How is it that the West that's paying for it, that's enabling it, can watch [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=715.18s)]
*  what's happening? And it's just no one seems to mind. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=720.38s)]
*  Nobody seems to care. Nobody seems bothered by it. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=723.0999999999999s)]
*  It's kind of like goes on. No one is even close to stopping it. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=725.78s)]
*  We just saw Trump order Netanyahu to turn the planes around from Iran, which [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=728.9799999999999s)]
*  obviously Biden could have done. Trump could have do at any time and they just [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=732.9399999999999s)]
*  won't. I'm going to try and try to figure out like how can this be? [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=735.8199999999999s)]
*  And I think one of the ways that that happens is the language of dehumanization. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=739.06s)]
*  So I think a lot of Americans have this perception of what Gaza is, what [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=743.98s)]
*  Palestine is, radically different than the reality. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=747.54s)]
*  I was interested in the work that you've done in creating libraries in Gaza. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=750.6999999999999s)]
*  You're obviously very well-spoken. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=755.62s)]
*  You just want to pull a surprise for your writing in English. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=757.14s)]
*  I've had Gazans on my show before who are very similar, highly educated, well [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=759.02s)]
*  spoken. There's a whole network of there were at least of Gazan universities and [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=763.34s)]
*  advanced centers of learning that are all now destroyed. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=769.42s)]
*  Gaza had one of the highest literary literacy rates in the world prior to [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=773.18s)]
*  October 7th. Some of the best doctors that are respected all around the world [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=777.7s)]
*  as specialists in their field. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=782.9s)]
*  Can you talk about what Gazan society and Gazan culture is like and how it has [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=783.86s)]
*  been just so completely destroyed in the last 20 months? [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=791.02s)]
*  Sure. Yeah. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=795.26s)]
*  I mean, before I answer your question, I would like to highlight the fact that [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=796.26s)]
*  for two years now, not a single student in Gaza went to school. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=799.9399999999999s)]
*  In fact, the schools have become shelters as we are talking just half an hour at [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=803.9s)]
*  the same time that Israel bombed a tent in Khan Younis. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=808.34s)]
*  Israel bombed a classroom on the third floor of a school called Amr Ibn Al-Az in [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=810.62s)]
*  Sheikh Ridwan in Gaza City and two or three people were reported to be killed. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=815.42s)]
*  So two years, no schools. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=820.46s)]
*  So anyone who was five years old when Israel attacked Gaza on October 7th [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=821.9s)]
*  hasn't gone to school for two years. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=826.86s)]
*  So this five-year-old child, if my children were to be there at the moment, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=830.22s)]
*  my five-year-old child would have missed his first grade and second grade. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=835.46s)]
*  And for two years, students have missed their high school diploma tests. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=840.54s)]
*  So two years. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=845.26s)]
*  So people in Gaza are missing not only their life, but their education. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=846.26s)]
*  People in Gaza are missing not only their life, but even those who survive. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=849.66s)]
*  They are missing a lot in their own lives. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=853.38s)]
*  The Gaza Strip lies on the beach of the Mediterranean Sea. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=855.9399999999999s)]
*  Gaza is rich for its plants and the trees. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=861.5799999999999s)]
*  One of the best places in Gaza is a city or town called Beit Lahya. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=866.3399999999999s)]
*  And it's very, very famous for strawberry farms. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=871.9399999999999s)]
*  My father-in-law is a strawberry farmer, and they use also to plant corn, onion, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=875.8199999999999s)]
*  watermelon, oranges, and they used to even to... [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=882.38s)]
*  I mean, when it is allowed to export some of the strawberries to the West Bank. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=885.42s)]
*  But Gaza is very beautiful, even though it has been under occupation since 1948. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=891.18s)]
*  It's been under siege since 2007. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=899.38s)]
*  Israel controls how much food gets into Gaza, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=901.66s)]
*  how many hours of electricity is available in Gaza, [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=904.98s)]
*  how much medicine is allowed to enter Gaza, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=909.22s)]
*  what kind of medical equipment get into Gaza, [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=912.82s)]
*  how many books get into Gaza. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=916.98s)]
*  Because when I was trying to build the Edward Said Public Library, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=920.1800000000001s)]
*  two branches in 2017, 2019, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=923.58s)]
*  and unfortunately Israel destroyed the two libraries, [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=927.0600000000001s)]
*  just like they destroyed all the universities in Gaza. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=929.6600000000001s)]
*  So Israel was in control of the entry of these books into Gaza. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=933.26s)]
*  Sometimes the books would be delayed by months. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=939.34s)]
*  It usually takes eight weeks for any box or any package to enter Gaza. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=942.9s)]
*  So Israel was controlling every, every single aspect of our lives in Gaza. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=947.8199999999999s)]
*  But despite that, we managed to make Gaza as much beautiful as we could. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=952.9s)]
*  But this campaign of destroying Gaza is non-stop. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=961.86s)]
*  Israel has been blowing up the houses in Bethlehem. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=970.54s)]
*  70% of Gaza has been either destroyed or damaged by Israeli, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=973.26s)]
*  not only Israeli airstrikes while people are sleeping inside, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=981.7s)]
*  but even the houses that people had to leave [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=984.86s)]
*  because Israel announced them to be a combat zone. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=986.98s)]
*  Israel has been systematically blowing these houses up. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=991.02s)]
*  And there are so many videos of Israeli soldiers [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=993.74s)]
*  documenting the blowing up of neighborhoods, of schools, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=996.86s)]
*  of their bulldozers, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=999.86s)]
*  destroying a hospital in north Gaza, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1002.5799999999999s)]
*  just next to the Indonesian hospital in Bethlehem. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1006.8199999999999s)]
*  So Israel has been systematically destroying everything in Gaza. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1010.06s)]
*  So the question is not about when will there be a ceasefire in Gaza, [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1014.1s)]
*  although the ceasefire is just a beginning of a bigger change in Palestine. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1019.54s)]
*  But the question is, even after the ceasefire, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1026.18s)]
*  Israel is trying to make it impossible for people to live again. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1028.6599999999999s)]
*  So let's say there is a ceasefire today. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1033.06s)]
*  There are no schools in Gaza. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1035.54s)]
*  70% of the population in Gaza do not have homes. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1038.98s)]
*  They are living in tents, even though they are living in tents, [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1042.98s)]
*  including some of my family members. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1045.74s)]
*  These tents get to be bombed. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1047.58s)]
*  Just a few days ago, Glenn, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1049.54s)]
*  my neighbor was killed in an airstrike [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1053.1399999999999s)]
*  when Israel hit a group of people walking next to it. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1057.5s)]
*  She was inside her tent. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1059.54s)]
*  And these tents are, you know, they are created, [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1060.9399999999998s)]
*  they are pulled up in the street, on the street. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1063.98s)]
*  So she was killed while she was inside her tent. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1067.34s)]
*  Her mother is still critically wounded. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1069.34s)]
*  And all her brothers were wounded. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1071.5s)]
*  So Israel continues to destroy, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1074.86s)]
*  to decimate as much of Gaza as possible. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1078.3799999999999s)]
*  And there is a systematic destruction of the refugee camps in Gaza. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1080.74s)]
*  Something that I wrote about in one of my pieces in The New Yorker [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1084.5s)]
*  is that Israel is not only destroying Gaza, [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1088.3799999999999s)]
*  you know, the cities and the villages and the towns, [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1092.34s)]
*  but they are also destroying refugee camps. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1094.3799999999999s)]
*  So, you know, the refugee camps after 1948, [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1097.3s)]
*  you know, it was a group of tents here and there. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1099.86s)]
*  And then, you know, their refugee status continued for years and years. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1102.78s)]
*  People started to build rooms from concrete. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1108.18s)]
*  And then over the years, they started to build multi-story buildings. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1111.3s)]
*  So the refugee camp sent into a small city. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1114.94s)]
*  So Israel currently destroyed most, I mean, [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1118.74s)]
*  much of the Rijabali refugee camp, the largest refugee camp in Gaza. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1122.34s)]
*  So these people are now who were, you know, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1126.78s)]
*  who lived in the refugee camp or people who were born in refugee camps like me [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1130.14s)]
*  and now are living in tents on the street, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1134.5s)]
*  and maybe sheltering in a school, in a hospital. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1136.66s)]
*  These people are now are dreaming of returning to the refugee camp. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1140.14s)]
*  So this is the fault of the world. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1144.22s)]
*  This is the fault of the world because they left the Palestinian people [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1146.7800000000002s)]
*  to live in refugee camps. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1150.6200000000001s)]
*  They left them without protection. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1152.3400000000001s)]
*  And they not only left them without protection, [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1154.6200000000001s)]
*  they continue to support, to fund Israel's genocide. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1156.78s)]
*  And they, you know, like the United States cut its funding for UNRWA, [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1161.98s)]
*  which has been responsible for the delivery of aid [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1166.86s)]
*  and for the education of so many people, including me. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1170.98s)]
*  So this world is not working properly, really. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1174.74s)]
*  It's very strange for us to be watching this, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1177.46s)]
*  even 20 months after the start of the genocide. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1180.82s)]
*  And for me to watch it from here, from the United States. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1184.54s)]
*  Yeah, it's got to be almost impossible. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1187.54s)]
*  You know, just to underscore the point too, which I know I don't need to tell you, [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1191.38s)]
*  but for people who are watching, I mean, the control of Gaza by the Israelis, [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1194.34s)]
*  including it probably intensified since they removed troops, [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1200.58s)]
*  which they had there in 2005, the control that continued was so great that, [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1203.66s)]
*  you know, the Israelis had phrases like really macabre, horrific, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1209.5s)]
*  dark phrases like mowing the lawn, which meant let's just go in and kill some Palestinians [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1212.86s)]
*  or put it, let's put the Palestinians on a diet when they would cut back [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1217.34s)]
*  the amount of food that they allowed in into Gaza. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1220.98s)]
*  This has been the mentality going on for a long time. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1223.7s)]
*  I wanted to just to ask you something. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1226.54s)]
*  Obviously, we talk a lot about the number of people in Gaza who have been slaughtered. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1229.1399999999999s)]
*  Since October 7th, the Israelis are now open about the fact that they want to make Gaza [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1235.22s)]
*  to force people to leave, to kill them until they leave, to destroy civilization until they leave, [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1240.7s)]
*  that it's at least a policy of ethnic cleansing. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1245.1000000000001s)]
*  One thing to think about a lot, though, is for the people who do survive, [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1248.02s)]
*  who are able to survive the genocide, survive this ethnic cleansing, this onslaught, [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1252.02s)]
*  I have to think about how is it possible for them to have a future here in Rio de Janeiro. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1257.26s)]
*  I live in Brazil in Rio de Janeiro, which is a city, especially in poorer areas, [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1261.5s)]
*  that has a very high level of violence, drug gangs and the like, very high murder rates. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1265.42s)]
*  I know some people who grew up there and they talk about, [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1270.1s)]
*  one time when I was seven years old, I saw a dead body on the ground, [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1272.78s)]
*  or twice when I was in my teenage years, I saw a gun shootout. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1275.54s)]
*  They talk about how psychologically scarring that is for life, [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1280.7s)]
*  like to be exposed to those kind of horrors even once or twice while you're growing up. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1284.38s)]
*  And here you have this massive civilian population in Gaza, [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1288.86s)]
*  50% of them are children, and the last two years, their lives have been nothing but [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1292.38s)]
*  bombing and destruction and murder and fear of death. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1297.5s)]
*  And just psychologically, how do you think that the people who are there, [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1300.02s)]
*  who do survive it, will be able to overcome that and at some point return to a normal semblance of life? [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1304.94s)]
*  Well, this is a very hard question to answer. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1313.3400000000001s)]
*  It's very obvious that the population that's been trying to survive, [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1318.1000000000001s)]
*  I mean, I don't like to say that people live in Gaza. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1323.18s)]
*  No, people are trying to survive in Gaza because there is a difference between [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1325.94s)]
*  living in Gaza and trying to survive a genocide. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1329.74s)]
*  So these people, for 20 months at least, they haven't lived a single day without suffering, [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1331.8200000000002s)]
*  without looking for food, looking for medicine, looking for water. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1337.3400000000001s)]
*  I mean, you know, Glenn, people, I was in Gaza for the first two months. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1340.6200000000001s)]
*  I remember walking in the street, you know, looking for water to fill a bucket of water, [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1346.18s)]
*  you know, for my children or for my wife, you know, to wash the dishes, maybe to have a shower, [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1351.3799999999999s)]
*  you know, in the school because there are no services in the school shelters, by the way. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1356.58s)]
*  I remember walking in the street and seeing five-year-old children, you know, [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1361.6599999999999s)]
*  standing in line to fill a bucket of water for their families or children, maybe 10 years old. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1365.78s)]
*  I saw some of my students standing in line, you know, to get a pack of bread. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1371.3799999999999s)]
*  And that was in October and November 2023. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1375.62s)]
*  That was before Israel tightened its genocide. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1378.22s)]
*  So these children, you know, five years old or seven years old, these are no longer children. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1382.42s)]
*  These children are not practicing childhood. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1389.5s)]
*  So this is a very dangerous reality. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1392.54s)]
*  And it should also be a signal that there would be a very dangerous future for these children. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1399.1000000000001s)]
*  50% of the population in Gaza are children. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1406.7s)]
*  So the question is for the Americans, for the Europeans who have been funding Israel's genocide [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1410.1799999999998s)]
*  and ethnic cleansing of the Palestinians in Gaza and also in the West Bank. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1415.22s)]
*  So what do they expect of these Palestinians once this genocide comes on? [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1418.98s)]
*  So what kind of people are the world expecting to see in the future? [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1424.5s)]
*  That's a question that I don't have an answer to, but I'm sure that these people, [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1429.1s)]
*  Palestinian people who have been surviving the genocide in Gaza, [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1433.3s)]
*  these will no longer be normal people. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1438.14s)]
*  I'm not a scientist. I'm not a psychologist. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1440.54s)]
*  But I think people in the world, especially officials and politicians and decision makers, [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1443.66s)]
*  they should think seriously about this. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1449.42s)]
*  What kind of people are we going to see after the genocide comes to an end? [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1451.42s)]
*  What kind of people are going to see, you know, who have been living under occupation? [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1456.26s)]
*  I don't have an answer to that, but if you think about it, I think there are many answers. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-FLKiJ8vk&t=1460.54s)]
