# Repeating Iraq War PROPAGANDA?
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [June 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM)
*  Let's remember that just like WMDs were the pretext for the war in Iraq, the nuclear program [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=0.0s)]
*  is the absolute pretext for this war in Iran. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=12.6s)]
*  There are no nuclear facilities in Tehran. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=17.2s)]
*  So if the idea here, the goal here supposedly is to destroy Iran's nuclear program, why [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=21.92s)]
*  do 16 million civilians have to evacuate Tehran where none of these facilities are located? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=28.44s)]
*  And again, there's been lots of civilians already killed in Iran and they're obviously [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=37.88s)]
*  planning on building huge more. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=41.6s)]
*  Now speaking of the kind of war propaganda to which we're being subjected, here was Netanyahu [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=44.0s)]
*  today. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  Every time Israel goes to war against whatever country, every time the US tells its citizens [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=49.400000000000006s)]
*  we have to pay for it, we have to arm it, we have to fight with Israel, you'll never [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=55.36s)]
*  guess what country we're told to think of as being equal to the new country that Israel [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=60.120000000000005s)]
*  wants to attack. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=67.84s)]
*  Moments ago Israel launched Operation Rising Lion, a targeted military operation to roll [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=69.64s)]
*  back the Iranian threat to Israel's very survival. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=76.52000000000001s)]
*  This operation will continue for as many days as it takes to remove this threat. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=81.24s)]
*  For decades the tyrants of Tehran have brazenly, openly called for Israel's destruction. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=86.88s)]
*  They've backed up their genocidal rhetoric with a program to develop nuclear weapons. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=93.67999999999999s)]
*  In recent years Iran has produced enough highly enriched uranium for nine atom bombs, nine. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=99.52s)]
*  In recent months Iran has taken steps that it has never taken before, steps to weaponize [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=107.58000000000001s)]
*  this enriched uranium. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=113.86000000000001s)]
*  And if not stopped, Iran could produce a nuclear weapon in a very short time. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=115.38000000000001s)]
*  It could be a year, it could be within a few months, less than a year. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=120.9s)]
*  This is a clear and present danger to Israel's very survival. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=125.22s)]
*  80 years ago the Jewish people were the victims of a Holocaust perpetrated by the Nazi regime. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=129.38s)]
*  Today the Jewish state refuses to be a victim of a nuclear Holocaust perpetrated by the [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=137.18s)]
*  Iranian regime. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=143.18s)]
*  The new Nazis, we were told Hamas is the new Nazis worse than ISIS. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=145.5s)]
*  We were told that about Saddam Hussein. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=151.74s)]
*  He was repeatedly equated with Adolf Hitler. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=154.02s)]
*  That's a crucial part of the underpinning of war propaganda for both the United States [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=157.54000000000002s)]
*  and Israel to invoke this World War II example that now happened 75 years ago and that has [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=160.94000000000003s)]
*  been used and hauled out to justify every war. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=169.3s)]
*  Now we've shown you before all the footage. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=171.42000000000002s)]
*  Everyone has seen now the montage of Netanyahu over 30 years of Israel, over 40 years going [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=174.22000000000003s)]
*  back to the Nicanates, ever since the Iranian people overthrew the Shavaron, the puppet [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=179.46s)]
*  installed by the CIA to serve Israel and the United States and use Iranian resources in [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=186.5s)]
*  servitude to be able to stay in power, repress the Iranian people. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=192.9s)]
*  Ever since that revolution occurred in 1979 that drove out the Shah and swept in a government, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=196.44s)]
*  an Islamic government, vowing to protect Iranian sovereignty at all costs, Iranian [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=203.34s)]
*  nationalism, Iranian sovereignty, ever since then we've been told for decades that they're [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=207.06s)]
*  about to get nuclear weapons, they're on the verge of getting nuclear weapons, they're [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=214.5s)]
*  weeks away, they're months away, maybe a year, milliseconds, and it never came true. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=217.34s)]
*  And yet the amount of people who are now willing to just start nodding the minute Netanyahu [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=223.94s)]
*  says oh they were about to get nuclear weapons this time, it's so alarming how easy it is [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=229.02s)]
*  to just convince people to nod and cheer as some other country just gets blown to bits [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=234.5s)]
*  as our U.S. resources are diverted to the military industrial complex, to weapons manufacturers, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=240.78s)]
*  starving again the people at home in the United States, the American working class, the American [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=247.5s)]
*  middle class, all of whom are promised and constantly are promised that this time it'll [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=251.66000000000003s)]
*  be different, that we're going to stay out of foreign wars. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=255.70000000000002s)]
*  You just give somebody a pretext and they're so eager to believe that their country is [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=261.02000000000004s)]
*  fighting for the right reasons. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=266.78000000000003s)]
*  I think a lot of it too is that when people feel impotent in their lives they start getting [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=268.22s)]
*  vicarious strength. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=272.66s)]
*  They like watching bombs going off and people being killed and feeling yeah we're the more [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=274.02000000000004s)]
*  powerful ones, we're crushing them, we're destroying them, which is why the world stood [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=278.54s)]
*  by, most of it did, certainly in the West as all of Gaza has basically been destroyed [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=282.62s)]
*  and huge numbers of people killed. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=289.22s)]
*  But what makes the Netanyahu claim that is that Iran was about to get a nuclear weapon [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=291.94000000000005s)]
*  this time so extraordinary when we watch members of the political class and both parties [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=297.22s)]
*  repeating it, Donald Trump repeating it, is that less than three months ago Donald Trump's [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=301.82000000000005s)]
*  hand picked director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, whose job it is to assess the [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=309.18s)]
*  intelligence and speak with one voice on behalf of the intelligence community about their [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=314.22s)]
*  best assessment about what the intelligence shows, went to the U.S. Senate and was asked [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=318.94000000000005s)]
*  about whether there's intelligence showing that as Israel claims Iran is actively pursuing [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=326.61999999999995s)]
*  nuclear weapons. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=332.29999999999995s)]
*  Just listen to what she said. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=333.29999999999995s)]
*  How is this being so easily disregarded? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=334.29999999999995s)]
*  This is not some deep state functionary, this is not a career service person, this is not [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=336.34s)]
*  a holdover, this is Donald Trump's choice who he fought very hard to install as DNI [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=341.97999999999996s)]
*  because he trusted her to give him the real intelligence and this is what she said under [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=347.9s)]
*  penalty of perjury, under lying to the Senate is a crime, when asked whether Iran is actively [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=353.02s)]
*  pursuing nuclear weapons. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=358.29999999999995s)]
*  The IC continues to assess that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon and Supreme Leader [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=359.78s)]
*  Khamenei has not authorized the nuclear weapons program that he suspended in 2003. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=366.26s)]
*  The IC can monitor closely if Tehran decides to reauthorize its nuclear weapons program. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=372.02s)]
*  So that was the assessment of the intelligence community just three months ago, which is [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=379.29999999999995s)]
*  has been repeatedly affirmed by the intelligence community that Iran is not in fact pursuing [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=382.86s)]
*  nuclear weapons. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=389.1s)]
*  I think what has happened in American discourse and in Trump's brain as well is that the distinction [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=390.26s)]
*  between a nuclear energy program, which the entire world has always agreed Iran has the [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=395.42s)]
*  right to have, and a nuclear weapons program, I think that distinction has been deliberately [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=400.06s)]
*  obscured. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=406.54s)]
*  You may remember at the start of the negotiation process between the U.S. and Iran, which President [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=407.54s)]
*  Trump was very enthusiastic about, Steve Witkoff said, of course the deal has to allow [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=411.86s)]
*  the Iranians to enrich at a low enough level to have nuclear energy. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=418.78000000000003s)]
*  What we can't have them do is enrich at 60% or 90% where they can get close to a nuclear [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=422.58000000000004s)]
*  weapon. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=429.46000000000004s)]
*  That is what the Iran deal did. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=431.1s)]
*  It put huge inspectors and surveillance inside of Iran, inside of these facilities underground, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=433.14s)]
*  we were able to monitor that Iran was not enriching uranium anywhere over the limit [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=438.66s)]
*  to which they agreed to keep it for nuclear energy purposes. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=444.3s)]
*  And when President Trump withdrew from that deal, despite you can read every congressional [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=449.70000000000005s)]
*  report saying that Iran had been abiding by that deal, the U.S. government, Western governments [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=454.70000000000005s)]
*  and NATO monitoring services, once President Trump withdrew from that deal, these inspectors [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=460.38s)]
*  were no longer permitted to be in there, but we still have all kinds of intelligence, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=466.34s)]
*  including all kinds of spies and everything else, as we've seen over the last five days, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=471.7s)]
*  tons of spies working for the U.S. and Israel. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=474.61999999999995s)]
*  That's how the intelligence community knew, and eavesdropping and surveillance, that the [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=476.9s)]
*  Ayatollah had not authorized or directed Iran to seek a nuclear weapon, despite what Prime [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=481.97999999999996s)]
*  Minister Netanyahu was claiming to justify this war. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=486.85999999999996s)]
*  Now I want you to listen to this. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=491.05999999999995s)]
*  This is in 2002, September of 2002, so just a little bit under six months before the U.S. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=492.26s)]
*  went and invaded Iraq, which overwhelmingly people in the United States agree was a huge [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=500.3s)]
*  disaster, a massive mistake, or really destroyed faith and trust in what our U.S. government [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=506.58s)]
*  tells us because it turned out that everything they said about why that war was necessary [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=512.9399999999999s)]
*  turned out to be a lie. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=516.66s)]
*  We were told it would be quick and easy. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=518.98s)]
*  It lasted many, many years. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=520.26s)]
*  Thousands of Americans died in that war for reasons no one understands. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=521.9s)]
*  And I'm not really sure why, but when the U.S. Congress was debating whether to authorize [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=526.54s)]
*  the United States to go invade Iraq, one of the people they wanted to come and testify [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=531.78s)]
*  before the Congress to tell them what to think and how to understand things, they invited [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=534.86s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=538.54s)]
*  And he went to the U.S. Congress, gave a ton of interviews publicly as well, urging and [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=541.66s)]
*  encouraging the United States to go invade Iraq, promising that it would bring all kinds [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=548.66s)]
*  of peace and harmony and democracy throughout the Middle East, would transform it, that [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=554.46s)]
*  the United States had a unique chance to get rid of Saddam Hussein and just transform the [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=558.38s)]
*  Middle East forever for the good. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=563.02s)]
*  But he also insisted that Iran had a WMD program and was pursuing nuclear weapons, exactly [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=566.5s)]
*  what he's trying to convince Americans now about Iran. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=572.1s)]
*  Listen to what he said. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=573.98s)]
*  Just listen to how identical this is. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=574.98s)]
*  This is Netanyahu, 23 years ago, convincing the United States to go fight a different [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=577.14s)]
*  war in the Middle East against one of Israel's most steadfast enemies. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=582.5799999999999s)]
*  And this is a tyrant who is feverishly trying to acquire nuclear weapons. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=586.78s)]
*  And today the United States must destroy the same regime because a nuclear-armed Saddam [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=593.3s)]
*  will place the security of our entire world at risk. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=599.74s)]
*  I just want you to listen to the dictate, the kind of dictatorial language he uses there, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=603.38s)]
*  because as we said, Yov Gont, the Israeli defense minister until Netanyahu fired him [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=613.5s)]
*  just six months ago or so, went on CNN earlier today and said the United States is obligated, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=618.22s)]
*  Trump is obligated to go fight this war against Iran with us. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=625.66s)]
*  Like giving out orders, like obligated by what? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=628.7s)]
*  Israel's dictates. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=631.5400000000001s)]
*  Listen to Netanyahu using that same language. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=633.62s)]
*  We'll place the security of our entire world at risk. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=636.14s)]
*  It's simply not reflecting the reality to assume that Saddam isn't feverishly working [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=640.7s)]
*  to develop nuclear weapons. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=652.58s)]
*  If you take out Saddam, Saddam's regime, I guarantee you that it will have enormous positive [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=654.62s)]
*  reverberations on the region. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=661.54s)]
*  I guarantee you, he said, I guarantee you, there's no way to deny, he said, that Saddam [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=663.3399999999999s)]
*  Hussein is rushing feverishly to get those nuclear weapons. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=669.4599999999999s)]
*  We have to stop that. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=672.54s)]
*  But also, he said, I guarantee you to Americans and to the U.S. Congress that if you go in [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=673.78s)]
*  and take out Saddam Hussein, you're going to spread peace and stability and democracy [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=680.34s)]
*  to this region. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=685.9000000000001s)]
*  Saddam's regime, I guarantee you that it will have enormous positive reverberations [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=686.9000000000001s)]
*  on the region. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=694.2600000000001s)]
*  Principles of real estate, the three L's, location, location, location. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=695.2600000000001s)]
*  The three principles of winning the war on terror are the three W's, winning, winning, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=698.5400000000001s)]
*  and winning. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=703.3800000000001s)]
*  The more victories you amass, the easier the next victory becomes. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=704.3800000000001s)]
*  The first victory in Afghanistan makes the second victory in Iraq that much easier. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=707.98s)]
*  The second victory in Iraq will make the third victory that much easier. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=712.58s)]
*  By the way, you know what the third victory was supposed to be? [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=719.14s)]
*  So we were going to have the first victory in Afghanistan that, of course, we never got. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=721.3000000000001s)]
*  It took 20 years. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=725.86s)]
*  We left after 20 years, blew up a bunch of civilians on the way out. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=726.86s)]
*  They then killed a bunch of our service members on the way out. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=732.1800000000001s)]
*  And within seconds or days, the Taliban marched right back into power as if nothing had happened. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=735.48s)]
*  After we were told for years that the US military spent billions and billions and billions of [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=743.08s)]
*  dollars building up the Afghan security forces, that one day we're going to rule Afghanistan [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=747.48s)]
*  in our favor once we left, we left after 20 years. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=754.24s)]
*  And a deal negotiated by President Trump, implemented by President Biden, and the Taliban [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=758.6s)]
*  marched right into power. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=763.28s)]
*  There was no first victory there. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=764.28s)]
*  There was no second victory in Iraq that Netanyahu promised. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=765.52s)]
*  Even Tony Blair, who, when he realized there were no weapons of mass destruction, despite [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=771.12s)]
*  having been one of the most vocal and ardent supporters of joining George Bush, having [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=776.6s)]
*  the UK join George Bush in that war and did so, when he realized there were no WMDs as [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=781.88s)]
*  he kept insisting there were, he said, he resorted to, well, at the very least, the [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=787.0s)]
*  The worst that will be said is that we removed a vicious dictatorship and freed the Iraqi [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=791.8s)]
*  people from this vicious dictator. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=796.6s)]
*  So it still will be a noble war. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=798.9599999999999s)]
*  And by 2012, Tony Blair was admitting that what gave rise to ISIS and all of its splinter [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=802.68s)]
*  groups that we were told was so much worse than al-Qaeda, which we had spent a decade [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=809.88s)]
*  fighting, was the power vacuum that we left in Iraq by taking out the government, balkanizing [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=813.92s)]
*  the country, letting huge amounts of civil war take place, war against the United States, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=822.28s)]
*  insurgency battles against the countries that went to war. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=825.68s)]
*  So there was no second victory in Iraq as well. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=830.12s)]
*  And if anything, the Iraq war redounded most to the benefit of Iran. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=832.9599999999999s)]
*  Saddam Hussein and Iran hated each other. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=838.4399999999999s)]
*  They went to war against each other. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=840.8s)]
*  And by removing the Ba'athist party, it empowered Shiite militias who have more power in Iraq [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=843.88s)]
*  now than ever before and therefore emboldened and empowered Iran in the region. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=852.1999999999999s)]
*  That was the result of the Iraq war that Benjamin and I promised would transform the region. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=856.3199999999999s)]
*  And of course, the nuclear weapons that he swore Saddam Hussein was pursuing and the [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=861.7199999999999s)]
*  chemical and biological weapons he assured us they had were all non-existent. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=865.12s)]
*  But you see he said, we're going to do that first victory in Afghanistan, the second victory [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=870.12s)]
*  in Iraq, and then we can do the third victory all the more easily. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=875.48s)]
*  So what was that third victory? [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=878.5200000000001s)]
*  War in Afghanistan, war in Iraq, what was it? [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=881.0400000000001s)]
*  You can go back starting around 2004, 2005, Neocon started going on a propaganda campaign [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=884.12s)]
*  saying the next step after Baghdad is Tehran. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=889.7600000000001s)]
*  That was their intention. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=893.58s)]
*  They wanted to have regime change in Afghanistan, regime change in Iraq, and then go to Tehran. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=894.58s)]
*  That was the big prize. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=898.76s)]
*  And because there weren't Afghanistan and the war in Iraq failed, they never got to [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=901.28s)]
*  go do that. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=903.56s)]
*  But he wanted American troops, thousands of American troops died in these wars he was [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=905.88s)]
*  urging and he wanted a lot more to go die in Iran. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=909.4s)]
*  So that was the third victory he was promising. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=913.8s)]
*  It just took 23 years to get the US to green light and then start supporting and funding [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=915.4399999999999s)]
*  the war that Israel has craved the United States fighting with them for decades. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=922.4399999999999s)]
*  This regime will do because Saddam's nuclear program has fundamentally changed in those [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=927.88s)]
*  two decades. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=934.0400000000001s)]
*  He no longer needs one large reactor to produce the deadly material necessary for atomic bombs. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=935.48s)]
*  He can produce it in centrifuges the size of washing machines that can be hidden throughout [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=942.32s)]
*  the country. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=947.24s)]
*  And I want to remind you that Iraq is a very big country. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=949.08s)]
*  It is not the size of Monte Carlo. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=954.8000000000001s)]
*  It is a big country. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=956.88s)]
*  And I believe that even free and unfettered inspections will not uncover these portable [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=959.84s)]
*  manufacturing sites of mass death. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=965.48s)]
*  Just think about it as a rational person. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=970.24s)]
*  This foreign leader for some reason is invited to tell the United States what it should do [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=972.72s)]
*  in whether or not to launch a major ground invasion on the other side of the world. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=977.12s)]
*  Everything he says, things that he guarantees, things he promises, things he insists on, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=981.48s)]
*  all of it turned out to be lies. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=985.64s)]
*  That same foreign leader returns two decades later, reads exactly the same script only [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=989.04s)]
*  this time about Iran, and people just start nodding their head without any kind of skepticism [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=993.56s)]
*  or doubt about the truth of what he's saying to lure the United States into another war. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1000.8s)]
*  Oh yeah, sure this time he's telling the truth. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1004.48s)]
*  Listen to this speech from George W. Bush. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1008.8s)]
*  This was kind of when the Trump and the Bush administration had decided it was going to [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1010.36s)]
*  war in Iraq. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1015.12s)]
*  There was no turning back. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1016.12s)]
*  And it was this question of selling the war robustly enough to get 70% of the people to [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1017.12s)]
*  get on board with it, which ultimately happened. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1023.08s)]
*  And this was one of Bush's primary initial speeches where he basically laid out the case [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1026.64s)]
*  for why we had to go to war with Iraq and remove Saddam Hussein. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1034.42s)]
*  I just want you to note in every second of this speech how identical, not similar, identical [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1036.96s)]
*  it is to what we're hearing now. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1043.48s)]
*  This is a speech he gave in Cincinnati in September of 2002, so right around the time [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1045.6s)]
*  that Netanyahu was in the United States, assuring everybody about how great the Iraq war would [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1050.9199999999998s)]
*  be and the necessity for it. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1055.48s)]
*  Listen to what he said. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1057.0s)]
*  Information from a high ranking Iraqi nuclear engineer who had defected revealed that despite [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1060.9199999999998s)]
*  his public promises, Saddam Hussein had ordered his nuclear program to continue. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1066.52s)]
*  The evidence indicates that Iraq is reconstituting its nuclear weapons program. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1075.04s)]
*  Saddam Hussein has held numerous meetings with Iraqi nuclear scientists, a group he [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1080.56s)]
*  calls his nuclear Mujahideen, his nuclear holy warriors. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1085.8s)]
*  Satellite photographs reveal that Iraq is rebuilding facilities at sites that have been [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1093.4s)]
*  part of his nuclear program in the past. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1096.8400000000001s)]
*  Iraq has attempted to purchase high strength aluminum tubes and other equipment needed [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1100.92s)]
*  for gas centrifuges, which are used to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1106.0400000000002s)]
*  If the Iraqi regime is able to produce, buy or steal an amount of highly enriched uranium [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1113.48s)]
*  a little larger than a single softball, it could have a nuclear weapon in less than a [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1119.6s)]
*  year. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1126.68s)]
*  And if we allow that to happen, a terrible line would be crossed. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1129.2s)]
*  Saddam Hussein would be in a position to blackmail anyone who poses his aggression. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1135.6s)]
*  He would be in a position to dominate the Middle East. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1142.04s)]
*  He would be in a position to threaten America. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1145.92s)]
*  And Saddam Hussein would be in a position to pass nuclear technology to terrorists. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1149.6000000000001s)]
*  Some citizens wonder, after 11 years of living with this problem, why do we need to confront [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1157.8000000000002s)]
*  it now? [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1164.0s)]
*  And there's a reason. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1166.8600000000001s)]
*  We've experienced the horror of September the 11th. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1169.3200000000002s)]
*  We have seen that those who hate America are willing to crash airplanes into buildings [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1173.46s)]
*  full of innocent people. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1178.64s)]
*  Our enemies would be no less willing. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1182.1000000000001s)]
*  In fact, they would be eager to use biological or chemical or a nuclear weapon. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1183.82s)]
*  Knowing these realities, America must not ignore the threat gathering against us. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1194.3400000000001s)]
*  Facing clear evidence of peril, we cannot wait for the final proof, the smoking gun [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1202.66s)]
*  that could come in the form of a mushroom cloud. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1208.74s)]
*  So we can't provide you proof or evidence that this is happening, but do you want to [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1214.26s)]
*  wait and have the proof be the mushroom cloud that Saddam Hussein drops on the United States [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1219.38s)]
*  or gives to his terrorist friends to drop on the United States? [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1225.44s)]
*  Now as we know, every word of that was absolute bullshit. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1230.1s)]
*  Every word of that was false. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1233.1799999999998s)]
*  Every word of it was disproven within a short period of time. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1234.56s)]
*  I don't mean most of it or some of it. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1237.9399999999998s)]
*  I mean all of it. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1239.3s)]
*  At least then, Americans had the excuse that this was barely a year after 9-11, like a [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1242.2199999999998s)]
*  truly traumatic attack on the United States. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1246.6999999999998s)]
*  People were still quite emotional about it if you told them that Osama bin Laden al-Qaeda [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1251.3s)]
*  somehow had an alliance with Iraq, which of course Jeffrey Goldberg and others convinced [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1258.72s)]
*  Americans they did, falsely, that Iraq would get these nuclear weapons that they're about [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1262.6000000000001s)]
*  to have and give it to Osama bin Laden who would then use it like a similar 9-11 attack, [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1267.1200000000001s)]
*  but this time with nuclear weapons. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1270.6000000000001s)]
*  At least there was like an emotional manipulation there that was still an open wound. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1271.6000000000001s)]
*  What's the excuse now for believing this? [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1276.5600000000002s)]
*  Look at all the countries with nuclear weapons. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1278.72s)]
*  Iran and Iraq, Pakistan and India just fought a war. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1282.5600000000002s)]
*  Two countries that hate each other, hate each other for decades. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1286.92s)]
*  And it ended fairly quickly with minimal damage. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1291.76s)]
*  It was a real war. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1293.92s)]
*  It was quite aggressive, but it ended quickly. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1295.24s)]
*  And one of the reasons is because both sides know the other has nuclear weapons. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1299.6000000000001s)]
*  It serves as a deterrent. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1302.68s)]
*  Saddam Hussein is going to take nuclear weapons and drop one on the United States despite [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1306.1200000000001s)]
*  the fact that we have the largest nuclear stockpile in the world after Russia, the most [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1309.8200000000002s)]
*  powerful and obliterate Iraq. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1313.14s)]
*  North Korea, which we're told is the most twisted, most demented, most bizarre, most [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1316.44s)]
*  psychologically unhinged country, has nuclear weapons. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1323.3200000000002s)]
*  They've had them for a long time. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1325.3600000000001s)]
*  Where are their suicidal impulses driving them to use nuclear weapons? [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1326.72s)]
*  The Iranians have demonstrated incredible restraint as they've been attacked in so many [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1330.8s)]
*  ways by Israel, threatened by the United States and Israel over many years. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1336.38s)]
*  But we watch the government lie to us using this exact script. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1342.26s)]
*  What is the excuse for believing it now? [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQRdIFl0OM&t=1345.3s)]
