# Christopher Rufo: The U.S. Government SHOULD Oversee Universities
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [May 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU)
*  What I want to ask you is this, is public private distinction. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=0.0s)]
*  Let's try and leave that aside just for hypothetical purposes. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=9.28s)]
*  And let's imagine that schools that are actually private schools, private universities, private [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=13.46s)]
*  colleges, they're not managed by the state, they're not funded by the state, they really [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=18.88s)]
*  don't have any dependence on the state at all, which is true for a lot of universities [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=23.84s)]
*  and colleges in the United States. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=29.88s)]
*  Do you think there there is any justification for the government to try to interfere in [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=32.8s)]
*  or dictate either curricular decisions or administrative decisions? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=38.56s)]
*  Well, here too we have to make an even finer distinction. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=44.36s)]
*  And so there are certain universities, the last count that I saw it was something like [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=49.4s)]
*  a dozen or two dozen, a very small number representing less than 1% of all universities [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=53.44s)]
*  around the country actually do not accept federal funding, do not accept federal financial [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=58.8s)]
*  aid. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=63.2s)]
*  You know, I'm a distinguished fellow at Hillsdale College, which is really the shining star [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=64.2s)]
*  of classical liberal arts education and Hillsdale as well. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=68.4s)]
*  I'm glad to hear that. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=74.68s)]
*  So so so I'm sure you know about Hillsdale is that they don't accept any federal money [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=76.28s)]
*  because they want to maintain their maximum independence and autonomy. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=81.96000000000001s)]
*  And so they don't they don't take money from the government. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=85.94s)]
*  They don't have a contractual obligations with the government. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=88.44s)]
*  And so they are really as as free and independent as can be for an academic institution in the [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=91.72s)]
*  United States. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=97.72s)]
*  That should be protected. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=98.9s)]
*  But there's a further question about these kind of private mega universities. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=101.52s)]
*  You know, they operate like hedge funds with some scientific research and then and then [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=107.47999999999999s)]
*  humanities departments. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=112.12s)]
*  You know, they don't have the same arrangement. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=114.36s)]
*  And so if we take Harvard, of course, it's in Massachusetts. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=116.6s)]
*  And so if it were a state university, Massachusetts would have influence. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=120.64s)]
*  But there's two things about Harvard. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=125.33999999999999s)]
*  One is a very interesting kind of historical observation that if you go back to the Constitution [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=126.96s)]
*  of 1780 written by Samuel Adams, John Adams and other of the original revolutionary figures, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=132.0s)]
*  there's an entire section on Harvard in the Constitution. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=138.84s)]
*  And actually, they had an obligation between the state and the university. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=142.08s)]
*  The state provided land, grants, monies. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=146.24s)]
*  And in exchange, the state actually had representation on Harvard's Board of Overseers written into [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=150.0s)]
*  the Constitution, the governor, the lieutenant governor, the magistrates, the local clergy. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=155.04000000000002s)]
*  And they wrote into the Constitution the explicit mission of the university, which was, you [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=161.22000000000003s)]
*  enough from our eyes, included to honor God and to create kind of good Christian men who [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=167.24s)]
*  could then assume leadership positions in church and state. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=173.92000000000002s)]
*  So the idea that there was this founding of radical autonomy is just totally not true [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=180.16s)]
*  compared against the actual evidence. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=186.66000000000003s)]
*  The question now, though, is not really between Massachusetts and Harvard, which has a limited, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=189.28s)]
*  but important relationship. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=194.8s)]
*  The question is, does the federal government, which provides Harvard, say, upwards of a [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=197.0s)]
*  billion dollars a year in taxpayer funding, what is the relationship between the federal [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=201.28s)]
*  government and what is essentially a national university, Harvard, or international? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=206.64000000000001s)]
*  They think of themselves as an international university. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=211.16s)]
*  I think that's largely true. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=213.12s)]
*  But the question is, what is the obligation for Harvard because it does accept federal [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=216.0s)]
*  funds? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=220.84s)]
*  And what is the contractual nature of that relationship? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=222.04s)]
*  There are reciprocal duties and obligations. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=225.04s)]
*  Harvard has to follow the Civil Rights Act of 1964. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=227.56s)]
*  Harvard has to follow basic standards of conduct in individual grant agreements. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=231.08s)]
*  And then in my view, the president has the authority to renegotiate the relationship [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=236.12s)]
*  with Harvard in itself. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=240.36s)]
*  If the president decides under his Article 2 powers and the administration decides that [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=242.4s)]
*  it needs to take another look at Harvard because, for example, it's violating American civil [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=249.88s)]
*  rights law, which, based on my reporting, it absolutely is doing. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=254.6s)]
*  Harvard is then jeopardizing its 501c3 tax status. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=260.59999999999997s)]
*  That's settled case law. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=263.71999999999997s)]
*  It's bipartisan. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=264.88s)]
*  Harvard is jeopardizing future federal contracts because, of course, the federal government [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=266.62s)]
*  can choose to not do business with an organization that is violating fundamental American law. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=271.0s)]
*  But even beyond that, it's totally within the right of the legislature or, in my argument, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=278.2s)]
*  the Department of Education or the White House itself to negotiate with Harvard to say, if [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=282.71999999999997s)]
*  you want to have access to a billion dollars a year of taxpayer money, you have to meet [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=288.47999999999996s)]
*  these reciprocal obligations. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=292.86s)]
*  And so those negotiations are happening right now. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=294.48s)]
*  And there's going to be legal disputes. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=297.71999999999997s)]
*  There's going to be political disputes. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=300.58s)]
*  There's going to be even personal disputes. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=302.32s)]
*  But I think the underlying reality is that if the American taxpayers are sending a university [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=305.12s)]
*  a billion dollars a year, it is well within their right to have basic expectations loaded [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=310.24s)]
*  into it. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=316.62s)]
*  And so on certain provisions like viewpoint diversity, which was in one of the Trump administration [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=317.72s)]
*  letters, I don't think that specific provision is wise or prudent at this point in time. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=322.34000000000003s)]
*  But I think the other positions, like, for example, requiring Harvard to eliminate its [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=328.24s)]
*  discriminatory DEI bureaucracy is totally within the kind of not only legally fair, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=332.36s)]
*  but actually morally, intellectually, and politically desirable. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=339.40000000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=343.84000000000003s)]
*  But there's a lot more going on with the Trump administration's attempt to interfere in or [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=344.84000000000003s)]
*  shape what's happening at these universities beyond just the admissions policy, which a [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=350.44s)]
*  lot of people, and I think there's a good argument to make about this, has become discriminatory. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=355.8s)]
*  There's a lot of attempts to influence the curriculum, to demand that certain kinds of [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=362.16s)]
*  views not be heard. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=367.52000000000004s)]
*  And I think there's been a lot of distortion about this idea of public funding to universities [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=369.12s)]
*  as the kind of read on which to hang the government's authority to mandate what colleges do. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=375.28000000000003s)]
*  This is not charitable giving. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=383.32000000000005s)]
*  This is not the administration funding Harvard so that they can pay their sociology professors [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=385.92s)]
*  and archeology professors or create gender studies programs. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=391.3s)]
*  The reason the federal government funds universities is in a very specific way, which is there [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=395.42s)]
*  certain kinds of research that the US government wants. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=400.3s)]
*  Some of it's military research, some of it's technological research, some of it is about [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=404.76s)]
*  medical treatments and medical cures. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=410.46000000000004s)]
*  When they give this money, they say this has to be used for these specific kinds of programs. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=413.5s)]
*  Mark Andreessen will tell you that that kind of arrangement is what led to US dominance [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=417.82s)]
*  of the internet because Al Gore got mocked for saying I meant the internet, but he really [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=422.54s)]
*  did lead the way, says Mark Andreessen, in funding internet research, what was called [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=426.46s)]
*  the information superhighway that led to all of these things. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=431.02s)]
*  It's not like a state school where they're funding Harvard's operation. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=435.53999999999996s)]
*  They're giving grants for very specific projects only because the US government believes that [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=439.5s)]
*  that will benefit the country and its interests. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=445.98s)]
*  One of the problems that I have with this framework is that every four years or eight [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=449.22s)]
*  years the president changes. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=454.38s)]
*  As a result, what these universities might be required to do as a result of this argument [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=457.90000000000003s)]
*  that the minute you accept one penny in federal funding, you're now subject to government [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=463.54s)]
*  supervision or control, is that let's say if the Biden administration had the view that [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=466.90000000000003s)]
*  the Trump movement was an insurrectionary movement threatening to the very core democratic [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=474.1s)]
*  values that shaped the country, which is what a lot of them believed, and would they be [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=480.38s)]
*  able to then say look, Yale, you get federal funding and yet you have these three faculty [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=485.82s)]
*  members, and you have these student groups that defend these insurrectionary movement, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=492.82s)]
*  which is the Trump movement, and that is a threat to our way of life and to our democratic [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=498.14s)]
*  values. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=503.78s)]
*  What objection would you have if the Biden administration used that leverage from public [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=505.17999999999995s)]
*  funding to demand that no Trump supporters be on the faculty or that no student groups [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=509.14s)]
*  be permitted to be formed in order to defend the ideology of the Trump movement on the [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=515.52s)]
*  grounds that they're insurrectionary? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=519.14s)]
*  Yeah, a couple things. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=521.18s)]
*  We'll take them in sequence. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=524.1s)]
*  I agree with you that the bulk of the federal funding is designated for scientific, military, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=526.5s)]
*  and medical research because those are very expensive things to do. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=534.42s)]
*  They require a lot of money, but there's two things. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=538.58s)]
*  It's not exclusively that. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=541.58s)]
*  Of course, they had funded DEI programs, they had funded humanities programs, they had funded [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=542.74s)]
*  gender studies programs, but even on those scientific grants, universities skim off the [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=547.46s)]
*  top sometimes more than 50% of the funds that then goes to their central administration. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=552.38s)]
*  Given that those funds are somewhat fungible, it does end up actually supporting the university [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=558.1s)]
*  as an entity. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=562.74s)]
*  If that university has a large DEI bureaucracy, as Harvard does, for example, I think that [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=563.74s)]
*  you have a very clear argument that taxpayer funds are either directly in many cases or [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=569.54s)]
*  indirectly through overhead funds supporting these discriminatory and illegal practices. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=575.5s)]
*  But even setting that aside, your question is, I think, about, well, what if the Biden [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=583.74s)]
*  administration comes back and does the same thing? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=589.62s)]
*  Or worse. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=593.34s)]
*  I think that the premise of that is actually, again, not factually accurate. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=594.34s)]
*  The Biden administration was doing the same thing and was doing much worse. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=601.9399999999999s)]
*  If you look at the federal grants to universities under the Biden administration, if you look [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=606.78s)]
*  at the promotion of DEI practices by the Biden Department of Education, you're talking about [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=611.02s)]
*  billions of dollars sloshing around supporting extreme and in many cases even illegal left-wing [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=618.06s)]
*  ideologies in universities, K through 12 schools. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=625.98s)]
*  But was that a legitimate exercise of state power? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=630.54s)]
*  Your theory is if the government's giving money to these institutions, they have the [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=633.74s)]
*  right to dictate to these institutions that they can or can't do things based on what [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=637.14s)]
*  they consider to be threats to the country. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=642.34s)]
*  Was the Biden administration justified in doing that? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=647.18s)]
*  In many cases, in my view, was it morally justified? [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=651.34s)]
*  No. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=655.7s)]
*  Would I support the same program? [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=656.9s)]
*  Legally justified. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=658.38s)]
*  But were they legally justified? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=659.38s)]
*  Many of them, if not most of them, yes. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=662.14s)]
*  And so that is, again, how it's supposed to work. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=664.86s)]
*  I don't like what the Biden administration was spending taxpayer money on, but I recognize [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=667.7s)]
*  that the Biden administration has a right to dictate policy. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=673.1s)]
*  That's why we elect presidents. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=677.26s)]
*  That's why we have a republic. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=679.1s)]
*  And that's why when Trump enters office, he has the authority to then change the policy, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=681.1s)]
*  to change what is funded, what is not funded. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=686.86s)]
*  And I know that people worry, well, what if it changes this way and that way and four [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=689.82s)]
*  years and eight years? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=693.66s)]
*  It's just going to go back. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=694.66s)]
*  That's how it's supposed to work. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=696.42s)]
*  I mean, you know, when you have a new administration that makes new promises to voters, that administration [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=698.14s)]
*  should have the ability to execute on those promises. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=704.3000000000001s)]
*  And in some cases, there will be continuity. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=707.62s)]
*  In other cases, there will be radical disjunctions. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=710.0600000000001s)]
*  But the alternative is much worse. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=713.0999999999999s)]
*  And the alternative is actually what we'd had previously for many decades. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=714.8199999999999s)]
*  The alternative was permanent left-wing bureaucratic rule within the federal administration and [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=719.3s)]
*  with the satellite university system, no matter who is in office. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=726.18s)]
*  And so what Trump is doing by disrupting the universities, by dismantling the Department [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=731.26s)]
*  of Education, by unleashing the Doge team to identify some of the worst ideological [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=736.26s)]
*  excesses and terminate those programs, he's actually restoring the basic democratic function [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=742.34s)]
*  of our republic to say he was elected on a promise to do something and he has the authority [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=749.26s)]
*  to do it. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=754.38s)]
*  And so I think that this is, while it's temporarily maybe uncomfortable or provide some turbulence, [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=755.7s)]
*  democratic rule is turbulent. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=763.7s)]
*  Democratic rule means switching things at four years, eight years, sometimes 12 years. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=765.98s)]
*  That's the nature of our system. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=771.14s)]
*  It's always been that way. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=772.58s)]
*  And actually the aberration is this idea that the president should go in and essentially [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=774.16s)]
*  cede any discretion to bureaucrats who were never elected, never earned a single vote [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=780.06s)]
*  and feel entitled to unlimited public money. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=787.66s)]
*  America fought the revolution for the Stamp Act, which is like a minor imposition. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=791.58s)]
*  If you compare that to what has been happening in education, it's like a hundred times more [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=798.78s)]
*  in affront to our liberties. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=805.42s)]
*  And I think that Trump is moving things in the right direction. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=806.86s)]
*  Well, I never understood at all, I've never heard it be said before, that American elections [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=809.62s)]
*  are about choosing a leader who will then dictate not only the policies of the government [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=819.3s)]
*  which he's leading, but also the administration and conduct of American universities or how [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=825.86s)]
*  private law firms function and trying to tell them what kind of pro bono cases they can [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=834.06s)]
*  and can't do. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=839.14s)]
*  In fact, certainly conservative ideology, as I've understood it, has always been about [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=840.14s)]
*  limiting the role of the federal government, not saying, oh yeah, now you're not only in [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=844.06s)]
*  charge of the federal government, but all private actors and private institutions which [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=848.62s)]
*  you can dictate to to make sure they're aligning with the ideology on which you ran and which [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=852.7s)]
*  voters want you to do. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=858.46s)]
*  Let's get a little specific. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=860.74s)]
*  I know we've gone about an hour, so I'm going to try and be very respectful of your time [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=861.74s)]
*  and just try and narrow down these last couple questions so I don't consume too much of it. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=866.0600000000001s)]
*  But just today there was a perfect example that I think really illustrates this tension. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=872.3s)]
*  The Congress yet again summoned university presidents to answer questions to politicians [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=876.94s)]
*  about how they're running their schools, what kinds of views they're allowing or not allowing, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=884.9s)]
*  whether they're punishing professors who express a certain view. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=891.3000000000001s)]
*  And it was Elise Stefanik who made a lot of headlines when she basically helped get several [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=894.86s)]
*  different university presidents fired when it came to the controversy about protests [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=902.9399999999999s)]
*  on campus and Israel and the like. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=909.22s)]
*  And she was questioning the president of Haverford College, which is a private college in Pennsylvania. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=911.62s)]
*  And I just want to show you this clip and ask you about it. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=918.18s)]
*  Let's play that clip. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=920.4599999999999s)]
*  Sure. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=921.4599999999999s)]
*  I want to ask you another example. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=922.4599999999999s)]
*  There was a professor of mathematics and statistics who posted after the October 7th Hamas terrorist [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=924.4599999999999s)]
*  attacks, quote, we should never have to apologize for celebrating these scenes of an imprisoned [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=930.98s)]
*  people breaking free from their chains. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=936.0200000000001s)]
*  This was a historic moment to be recorded in their history books. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=937.7800000000001s)]
*  Jewish students have reported that you said this post could be, quote, perceived in many [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=941.82s)]
*  ways. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=946.4200000000001s)]
*  Does this post simply depend on the context President Rabin and were there any disciplinary [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=947.5400000000001s)]
*  actions taken against this professor? [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=953.0600000000001s)]
*  Such posts have been incredibly harmful to our entire community. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=957.34s)]
*  And I disavow them and that outcome for us. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=962.44s)]
*  Was there an investigation of the professor? [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=966.98s)]
*  Investigations happen in all such cases. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=970.4200000000001s)]
*  So yes, in this case. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=974.0400000000001s)]
*  Investigations happen in all such cases, as I have said. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=976.8000000000001s)]
*  And we follow... [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=980.02s)]
*  This is a simple question. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=981.02s)]
*  The other presidents are answering this straightforward as to disciplinary action. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=982.3000000000001s)]
*  Again, these university presidents who are former presidents fail to answer these direct [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=987.14s)]
*  questions. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=991.1800000000001s)]
*  In this case, was there disciplinary action taken or an investigation of this professor? [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=992.1800000000001s)]
*  Respectfully, Representative, I will not be talking about individual cases. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=996.38s)]
*  Respectfully, President of Haverford, many people have sat in this position who are no [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1001.98s)]
*  longer in the positions as president of universities for their failure to answer straightforward [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1006.38s)]
*  questions. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1011.02s)]
*  Another question I... [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1012.02s)]
*  All right, so that last part was obviously not even implicit. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1013.42s)]
*  Basically an explicit threat that she's gotten college presidents fired before and maybe [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1017.66s)]
*  that will befall this president as well. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1022.54s)]
*  So that case was one where a professor, not in the classroom but on social media, posted [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1025.24s)]
*  essentially an argument saying that because the Israelis are occupying and repressing [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1031.8799999999999s)]
*  the Palestinians in Gaza, like all people who are being occupied and repressed, they [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1038.58s)]
*  have the right to pick up arms as resistance. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1041.98s)]
*  That's a view offensive to a lot of people, at least in the United States. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1045.18s)]
*  There have been other cases where conservatives have defended professors who also express [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1049.78s)]
*  views very offensive to people such as Amy Wax, who's been on my show before. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1053.94s)]
*  They tried to actually fire her for making statements I would say most people regard [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1058.26s)]
*  as racist. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1062.3s)]
*  And I supported her tenure in academic freedoms rights and a lot of colleges did too. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1064.34s)]
*  So to me I would say this is something that people debate all the time. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1068.82s)]
*  What is terrorism? [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1073.3s)]
*  Who should be on the list of terrorists? [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1075.3s)]
*  In the 1980s, as I'm sure you know, the US government classified Nelson Mandela and the [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1077.62s)]
*  African National Congress as terrorists on its official list and yet people all the time, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1082.98s)]
*  including on universities, especially on universities, defended Mandela, defended the ANC, disputed [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1089.98s)]
*  the government's view of them being terrorists. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1094.98s)]
*  Is that the role of a proper role, as you see it, of the United States Congress to be [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1099.26s)]
*  demanding that college presidents, not of public schools but of private ones, that they [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1103.3000000000002s)]
*  fire professors for political views that they believe in and express outside of the classroom? [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1110.3000000000002s)]
*  Well, a couple answers to that question. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1117.3000000000002s)]
*  I mean, if you're asking me what is my belief, I think the answer would be no. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1120.74s)]
*  I think that you want to have core protections for academics so that they can express views [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1127.18s)]
*  even if they're controversial. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1134.6200000000001s)]
*  I think there are limits institutionally to that. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1136.6200000000001s)]
*  I don't think that it is. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1140.38s)]
*  I think that academic freedom comes with the corresponding academic responsibility. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1141.8200000000002s)]
*  I think that is important to understand. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1146.78s)]
*  In this case, though, I think what's happening with Congress is that Congresswoman Stefanik [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1150.7s)]
*  is very skillfully using this issue to enact a series of cultural reforms. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1154.98s)]
*  She's putting the professor on the hot seat. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1164.98s)]
*  You're now in between Congress and, in theory, you're in between a huge constituency of the [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1167.5800000000002s)]
*  American public and then also on your other side, you're radical faculty members. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1172.6200000000001s)]
*  What's happening is that you're creating a wedge that is advantageous for Republicans [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1178.58s)]
*  and then, in theory, will lead to some knock-on cultural effects that might be salutary in [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1184.06s)]
*  broader university reform. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1189.38s)]
*  I didn't hear her call on this person to be fired. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1191.14s)]
*  Maybe she said so later in the clip. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1194.62s)]
*  Obviously, Congress should not be... [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1197.18s)]
*  Were they punished? [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1199.74s)]
*  She asked a question, and so I think it's a bit different to ask than to demand. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1202.34s)]
*  Obviously, Congress should not be... [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1207.78s)]
*  What was followed up by that threat that the university president may get fired for not [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1208.78s)]
*  having taken action against this professor for what he said? [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1213.9s)]
*  Sure, sure. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1218.06s)]
*  Okay, yeah. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1219.06s)]
*  I'm not sure on all the details except for the clip that I saw. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1220.74s)]
*  I wasn't aware of this. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1223.02s)]
*  But to your broader question, is it appropriate to have Congress weighing in on academic issues? [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1224.02s)]
*  The obvious answer is yes. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1232.42s)]
*  We have an education committee. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1234.54s)]
*  We have $140 billion a year that goes from Congress to universities. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1236.34s)]
*  And so, look, Haverford College accepts federal funds, and so they have to accept the responsibilities [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1243.82s)]
*  that come along with that. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1248.86s)]
*  And part of that responsibility is showing up and testifying and taking hard questions. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1249.9399999999998s)]
*  This is how it's supposed to work, and you might have a different opinion than Congresswoman [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1256.74s)]
*  Stefanik on this particular issue, Israel-Palestine. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1260.4199999999998s)]
*  But I think that it's totally fair for her to do so, and I think it's totally fair for, [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1264.74s)]
*  let's say, a left-wing congressman to take the same tack from the opposite direction [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1269.3799999999999s)]
*  to a university president that is vocally pro-Israel. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1274.98s)]
*  This is good. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1278.8999999999999s)]
*  We're bringing these questions into the public sphere. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1279.8999999999999s)]
*  We're engaging in them in a way that is, I think, fruitful and revealing. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1282.02s)]
*  And then Congress then has to deliberate. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1286.22s)]
*  Do we want to keep spending $140 billion a year subsidizing these people, or do we want [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1288.62s)]
*  to actually have real and significant reforms? [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1293.62s)]
*  I think what the congresswoman is doing is good, because I hope that it will lead to [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1296.4199999999998s)]
*  significant reforms. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1301.82s)]
*  And this is part of that deliberative process, and using salacious individual examples like [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1303.54s)]
*  this professor is part of how politics proceeds. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1309.46s)]
*  Again, that's always been the case. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1313.06s)]
*  I don't see this as anything different. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1315.1s)]
*  I guess I'm just shocked to hear anybody, but especially people who identify as conservatives, [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1317.38s)]
*  which for as long as I've been alive has been arguing for a much more limited role of the [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1324.46s)]
*  federal government in our lives and in our freedoms, to believe that the proper role [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1329.82s)]
*  of the U.S. government, the president or the congress, is to insist that certain views [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1336.98s)]
*  be made off limits or prohibited or even just a generalized role. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1342.98s)]
*  But I don't believe that. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1349.7s)]
*  And I'm not advocating that. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1351.18s)]
*  I mean, look. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1352.38s)]
*  But she was, and you defended that. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1353.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1356.06s)]
*  I don't think that she was doing that. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1357.06s)]
*  I don't think that's an accurate characterization. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1359.66s)]
*  And look, again, I put my own opinion at the top of my previous answer. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1362.5s)]
*  I think I'm on the record with that. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1366.22s)]
*  The point about conservatism is an important one. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1369.7s)]
*  And conservatism is at an inflection point. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1372.34s)]
*  In my ideal world, I would like to see a university system that is almost completely untethered [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1375.1s)]
*  from the government. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1381.18s)]
*  We could reduce universities by half as far as federal funding, let's say. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1382.58s)]
*  I would very much support that. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1387.82s)]
*  I would support actually even zeroing out the federal budget support for universities, [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1389.02s)]
*  even a choice between one and the other in some ideal world. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1397.1s)]
*  But that's not the world we live in. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1400.6599999999999s)]
*  That's not feasible. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1401.86s)]
*  That's not likely. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1403.1399999999999s)]
*  That's not going to happen. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1404.1399999999999s)]
*  And so the question is for conservatives is, given the fact that we spend an enormous amount [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1405.1399999999999s)]
*  of money on universities, until we get to, let's say, even libertarians, like we want [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1410.02s)]
*  a utopia of no federal funding, no even state funding. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1416.46s)]
*  I support state funding for universities. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1420.54s)]
*  Federal funding is a little bit different. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1422.3799999999999s)]
*  But until we get to this utopia, we have to deal with the hard questions, which is, what [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1424.36s)]
*  is the money going towards? [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1429.6399999999999s)]
*  What are the basic conditions of law? [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1431.28s)]
*  And if a university is violating civil rights law, I think that conservatives have to be [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1433.8799999999999s)]
*  ready to enforce it. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1437.8s)]
*  Because what's happened in the past is the worst of both worlds. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1439.52s)]
*  Conservatives take a totally laissez-faire approach. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1444.84s)]
*  And in a sense, what they do is they delegate all of the regulation, enforcement, financing, [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1447.8799999999999s)]
*  and governance to their opponents. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1453.6s)]
*  And so I think that the Trump administration is fundamentally changing in the right direction. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1456.52s)]
*  And I don't buy the argument that you're making that we're making things off limits, we're [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1461.24s)]
*  censoring. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1466.24s)]
*  That's not true at all. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1467.1599999999999s)]
*  But what we are doing is saying, hey, if you're going to take federal cash, you can't discriminate [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1469.04s)]
*  on the basis of race. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1473.12s)]
*  And you have to meet some minimum standards to qualify for that money. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1474.9199999999998s)]
*  Conservatives argued against building this machine for many decades. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1480.6s)]
*  The left didn't listen. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1485.52s)]
*  They created the machine. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1486.52s)]
*  And now I think conservatives are learning how to use it. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1487.6799999999998s)]
*  Is that ideal? [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1491.04s)]
*  No. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1492.04s)]
*  Is that the system that I would design from scratch? [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1493.04s)]
*  No. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1495.1999999999998s)]
*  But that's the political reality that we live in. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1496.1999999999998s)]
*  And so in order for us to move towards that ideal, I think we have to come up with a prudent [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1498.7199999999998s)]
*  policy in the intervening years. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1503.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1505.28s)]
*  I think it was pretty clear what she was doing. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1506.28s)]
*  People can make that own judgment. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1507.68s)]
*  But also there is a lot of imposition of the limits of debate being imposed by the Trump [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1510.24s)]
*  administration, including requiring Colombia to put their Middle East studies under a receivership [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1515.92s)]
*  and subject to the monitoring of the federal government, or forcing schools to adopt this [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1521.68s)]
*  much more radically expanded definition of anti-Semitism as their hate speech definition [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1525.96s)]
*  that's prohibited, that includes a whole variety of common criticisms of Israel or criticisms [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1531.8400000000001s)]
*  of specific American Jews. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1537.16s)]
*  These are limits on the ability of universities, what you can and can't say at universities. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rjVvt0spDU&t=1539.2s)]
