# Coward & Fraud Bernie Confronted on Israel Support
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [February 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno)
*  Bernie Sanders is probably the person I find most loathome in all of this because as I [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=0.0s)]
*  said, one thing you cannot criticize the Israelis for is that you cannot say they hid their [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=16.28s)]
*  intentions about what they were going to do in Gaza. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=21.96s)]
*  They were very clear about what they intended to do, which was destroy Gaza. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=23.76s)]
*  And when it mattered, and when it was hard, believe me, to stand up and oppose what the [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=28.52s)]
*  Israelis were doing in Gaza, to oppose the United States support for it in October and [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=34.84s)]
*  November when it actually mattered, Bernie Sanders was running around defending Israel, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=38.64s)]
*  opposing a ceasefire, insisting that the Israelis were acting properly and defending Biden for [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=45.68s)]
*  arming and financing Israel. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=52.08s)]
*  And Bernie Sanders has begun to change his rhetoric solely because there are polls showing [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=55.44s)]
*  that the Biden administration is endangered by anger over the left. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=62.4s)]
*  In fact, anger over the left, including against Bernie Sanders. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=70.24s)]
*  Here from the New York Times, you see an article November 30th on Israel's war against Hamas. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=73.44s)]
*  Sanders faces a backlash from the left. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=78.36s)]
*  The progressive disappointment with the Vermont senator, a liberal icon, reflects a broader [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=81.84s)]
*  divide among Democrats over the war. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=85.92s)]
*  And it talks about how Biden's reelection can be imperiled if this continues for so [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=87.64s)]
*  long. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=93.39999999999999s)]
*  And the anger of Bernie Sanders was because when it mattered, when it was hard to stand [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=94.39999999999999s)]
*  up and oppose what Israel was doing, the emotions around October 7th were very high. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=99.17999999999999s)]
*  And anyone who did it suffered a significant cost. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=103.32s)]
*  And as far as I can assure you, Bernie Sanders was cheering Israel on. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=107.0s)]
*  And only in the last two months, when he knows it doesn't matter, when the Democratic Party [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=111.48s)]
*  needs him to show angry liberals and angry leftists and angry young people that there's [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=116.08s)]
*  still a home for them in the Democratic Party, because Bernie Sanders is also angry with [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=120.44s)]
*  Israel, only then did he become willing to criticize what Israel was doing. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=124.88s)]
*  And even then, he's doing it in the most mealy-mouthed way possible. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=129.36s)]
*  Here is a remarkable interview. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=136.16s)]
*  And I want to credit the journalist... [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=138.72s)]
*  Yeah, it's Ashkara from Navarra Media, who did a great job in trying to press Bernie [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=141.2s)]
*  Sanders, who's in the UK, on exactly what his position is. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=147.2s)]
*  And you tell me whether you think... [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=151.96s)]
*  Again, he's definitely willing to criticize Israel now that it doesn't matter anymore [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=153.4s)]
*  that he needs to do so politically. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=158.22s)]
*  But just listen to how he refuses to give his real opinion on any of the questions she's [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=160.12s)]
*  asking. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=164.88s)]
*  In addition to stopping the billions of dollars in military aid that Israel gets from the [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=165.88s)]
*  United States every year, would you back calls for a cultural, sporting and economic boycott [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=171.56s)]
*  of Israel? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=178.44s)]
*  I am nervous of an economic boycott of any country, to be honest with you. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=179.44s)]
*  Now, that is an absolute lie. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=183.12s)]
*  The United States has an economic boycott of all kinds of countries, of Cuba, of Venezuela, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=186.16s)]
*  of Syria. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=190.68s)]
*  And Bernie Sanders supports all of those. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=192.46s)]
*  He's not opposed to economic boycotts of countries. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=194.22s)]
*  Let's go on. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=197.9s)]
*  But right now, what people want to do, they can do what they want to do. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=199.18s)]
*  But right now, again, my job as a United States Senator, and I'm kind of leading that effort [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=203.9s)]
*  in the Senate, is to tell Netanyahu that he is not going to get any more USAID. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=209.06s)]
*  Did you feel nervous about the boycott movement against apartheid South Africa? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=213.86s)]
*  Was that a concern you had at the time? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=217.28s)]
*  What I thought that... [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=221.34s)]
*  That's a good question as well. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=223.70000000000002s)]
*  One of the things that took down the apartheid regime of South Africa in the 1980s was exactly [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=226.3s)]
*  the kind of economic boycott Bernie Sanders just said. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=229.98000000000002s)]
*  He's unwilling to support. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=234.3s)]
*  So she asked him, well, what about your views of South Africa and the boycott against apartheid [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=235.3s)]
*  South Africa that was called for by the black people of South Africa trying to end apartheid? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=240.88s)]
*  Were you also against that on this principle of yours that you don't support boycotts? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=245.46s)]
*  And here's what he said. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=249.5s)]
*  I thought that as an apartheid state at that point, it was important to put pressure. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=252.06s)]
*  But people can do as they want. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=257.66s)]
*  And that's all. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=259.82s)]
*  Do you think that it's right that British citizens and American citizens can go and [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=261.7s)]
*  fight in the IDF when, as you say, there are such profound humanitarian concerns in Gaza? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=266.1s)]
*  Well, I think if British and American people want to do that, I suppose they have the right [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=273.94s)]
*  to do it. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=278.82s)]
*  It's not something that I... [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=279.82s)]
*  That is not a universal right. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=281.5s)]
*  You don't have the right to go and fight in the Russian army or to go fight in the Syrian [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=282.82s)]
*  army or to go fight in the Iranian army. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=286.65999999999997s)]
*  That will be treason. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=289.9s)]
*  You will get charged with treason if you do that. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=290.9s)]
*  But Bernie Sanders saying, but for Israel, yeah, if you want to go fight for Israel, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=294.34s)]
*  as a lot of Americans do, people make a big point of the fact that among the hostages [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=297.34s)]
*  taken by Hamas on October 7th were Americans. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=301.82s)]
*  That's because a lot of Americans go and fight in the Israeli army. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=304.34s)]
*  And there may have been some hostages who were just visiting. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=309.38s)]
*  There were hostages representing, I think, nine or ten nations, including Thailand and [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=314.02s)]
*  Brazil and other countries. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=318.46s)]
*  But a big reason why there are so many Americans in Israel is because Americans go and fight [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=321.38s)]
*  for the Israeli defense force, something you're allowed to do, even though you're not allowed [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=325.38s)]
*  to do that for every other country. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=328.85999999999996s)]
*  I really thought a whole lot about that. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=330.46s)]
*  Do you think they should have the right? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=332.29999999999995s)]
*  Look, I think what the Israeli government doing now is horrible. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=333.82s)]
*  And I'm not quite sure why people would want to be part of that effort. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=338.21999999999997s)]
*  She then tried to ask him several times as well, would you say that Israel is guilty [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=344.06s)]
*  of genocide? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=347.09999999999997s)]
*  And he, as he's done many times before, has refused to give an answer. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=348.09999999999997s)]
*  Now, as I said earlier, that for the first two months, Bernie Sanders was singing a much [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=353.5s)]
*  different tune. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=359.62s)]
*  He was on Face the Nation in December of 2023, about exactly two months after the October [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=360.62s)]
*  7th attack. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=367.54s)]
*  And he was asked about whether he supports a ceasefire in Gaza. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=368.54s)]
*  By this point, something like 10,000 Palestinians had been killed, many thousands of children. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=371.94s)]
*  And here's what the socialist senator, the independent senator from Vermont said. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=377.86s)]
*  Now, Bernie Sanders got a lot of support for saying that, including from the biggest pro-Israel [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=390.62s)]
*  activist group, AIPAC, which promptly went to Twitter and said, thank you, Senator Sanders [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=410.42s)]
*  for your strong opposition to a permanent ceasefire with Hamas. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=415.58s)]
*  There are people who from the start opposed the Israeli war in Gaza and US support for [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=421.5s)]
*  that war and who still do. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=425.94s)]
*  And then there are people who supported the Israeli war in Gaza. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=429.42s)]
*  I know a lot of people in my life who did that and still do. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=432.58s)]
*  And on some level, I can at least respect the intellectual consistency of that. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=436.18s)]
*  People in my life said, look, what happened on October 7th is an absolute atrocity. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=443.5s)]
*  No country can allow that to happen. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=448.06s)]
*  And whatever Israel needs to do to go prevent that from happening again, I support that. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=451.98s)]
*  And those people have continued to this very day to maintain that principle. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=456.3s)]
*  What Bernie Sanders and so many other Western liberals did was stand up when it was so politically [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=461.74s)]
*  cheap to do so, when it took courage not to do it, and stood up and applauded the Israelis [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=469.22s)]
*  and said, we support the right of the Israelis to go in Gaza and do what they want to do. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=475.38s)]
*  Knowing that the Israelis would do exactly this because Israel said it would. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=481.54s)]
*  And now what's happening is two things. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=487.78000000000003s)]
*  One is there's the political need for Bernie Sanders to now suddenly change his tune so [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=489.62s)]
*  we can try and attract the young voters and the left wing voters who once idolized him [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=495.1s)]
*  so he can lead them to go vote for Joe Biden. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=500.86s)]
*  But I think the bigger motivation is actually the more ignoble one, which is that Bernie [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=504.7s)]
*  Sanders doesn't want the pile of corpses in Gaza on his conscience or on his legacy, even [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=509.7s)]
*  though he absolutely is responsible for them because he cheered this for a long time when [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=515.86s)]
*  his opposition actually could have made a difference. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=521.26s)]
*  And a lot of these Western liberals who cheered Israel when there was so much pressure on [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=525.5s)]
*  them to do so, now are suddenly saying, oh my, this is too far. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=529.66s)]
*  I can't support this. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=535.9799999999999s)]
*  This is what they supported. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=539.86s)]
*  This is what they encouraged. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=541.02s)]
*  This is what they enabled. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=542.26s)]
*  And now suddenly they don't want it to be on their legacy and their conscience that [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=544.86s)]
*  they supported it, even though they did so they want to pretend that now they're against [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=547.5799999999999s)]
*  it. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=550.8199999999999s)]
*  And you cannot let them rewrite that history. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPrBjudzno&t=551.8199999999999s)]
