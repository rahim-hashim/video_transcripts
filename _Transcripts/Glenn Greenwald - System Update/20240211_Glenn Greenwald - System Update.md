# A Rare–And Heartening–Free Speech Victory in the West
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [February 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g)
*  Professor David Miller was employed as a political sociologist at the University of Bristol until [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=0.0s)]
*  2021 when there was a campaign launched on the part of British politicians, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=14.4s)]
*  which should sound familiar because we have a lot of politicians now trying to dictate the colleges [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=21.04s)]
*  what views they can and cannot allow, as well as Jewish student groups and Jewish activist [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=25.36s)]
*  groups in the UK demanding that he be fired, not because he had any altercation with any student, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=31.52s)]
*  not because he engaged improperly with any student, there was no harassment claims, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=36.879999999999995s)]
*  no claims of physical assault or anything of that kind. It was solely and strictly based [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=41.28s)]
*  on his philosophical view that Zionism was a philosophy that he believes is inherently [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  unjust. He opposes Zionism as a philosophy. Obviously a lot of you don't agree with that [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  philosophy, some of you probably do, but if there's one thing that's important, at least I've been [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=60.88s)]
*  hearing for the last many years from the American right in the United States, is ensuring that [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=66.08s)]
*  journalists or rather that professors and scholars and academics have the full-fledged right to [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=71.04s)]
*  express their views without being punished for the expression of those political opinions or [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=76.72s)]
*  because those political opinions don't align with establishment orthodoxy. We had him on our show [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=81.12s)]
*  back in August to tell the story of how he got fired and why he decided to appeal the firing to a [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=87.44s)]
*  British court and earlier today the court issued a unanimous judgment fully in his favor or at [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=95.2s)]
*  least in favor in his favor on the court question of whether he was unjustly fired and here's part [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=103.36000000000001s)]
*  of what the court said, quote, the claimant that's Professor Miller, anti-Zionist beliefs, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=109.12s)]
*  qualifies as a philosophical belief and a protected characteristic pursuant to section 10 [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=115.12s)]
*  of the Equality Act of 2010 at the Material Times. Professor Miller succeeds in his claims of direct [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=121.60000000000001s)]
*  discrimination because of his philosophical belief contrary to section 13 of the Equality Act in [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=127.76s)]
*  relation to A, the university's decision to dismiss him on October 1st, 2021 and B, the [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=133.12s)]
*  university's rejection of his appeal against his dismissal on February 23rd, 2022. Professor Miller [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=141.6s)]
*  succeeds in his claim for unfair dismissal pursuant to section 98 of the Employment Rights Act of 1996 [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=148.4s)]
*  and Professor Miller succeeds in his claim for wrongful dismissal. Quote, throughout his academic [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=155.20000000000002s)]
*  career, Professor Miller focused his research and teaching upon state and corporate propaganda, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=161.12s)]
*  public relations, and lobbying. He had been published extensively on a diverse range of [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=166.88s)]
*  topics. His academic work has been both political and controversial. He has also been a politically [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=172.08s)]
*  active academic prior to the incidents and events in this case. He was never subject to any [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=177.68s)]
*  disciplinary process by any university. During this period, Professor Miller also frequently [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=183.28s)]
*  made public statements and expressed his views on a range of issues, a number of which could be [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=188.96s)]
*  viewed as controversial in nature. Professor Miller believes and also believed when he was employed [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=192.8s)]
*  by the university that Zionism, which he defines as an ideology that asserts that a state for Jewish [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=198.8s)]
*  people ought to be established and maintained in the territory that formerly comprised the British [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=204.32s)]
*  Mandate of Palestine, is inherently racist, imperialist, and colonial. He also considers [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=209.04000000000002s)]
*  Zionism to be offensive to human dignity and on that basis, and he therefore opposes it. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=214.72s)]
*  And it was that view, and that view alone, ruled the court that led the university to fire him [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=220.16s)]
*  under great pressure and the university and the court unanimously ruled in his favor upholding [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=226.07999999999998s)]
*  core rights of free speech, free thought, free discourse, and academic freedom in saying that [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=230.88s)]
*  even opposing Israel is an opinion that is protected by free speech and for which you cannot be fired [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=236.16s)]
*  as a professor at a university. We are delighted to welcome Professor Miller back to the show to [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=243.68s)]
*  speak about the culmination, or up until now the culmination, of his effort to vindicate his free [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=248.64000000000001s)]
*  speech rights. Professor Miller, it's great to see you. Congratulations. Thanks so much for joining us. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=255.44s)]
*  Thank you very much. So before we get into this amazing victory, and it's a victory not only for [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=261.2s)]
*  you but for everybody who believes in free speech, including people who disagree with you, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=266.24s)]
*  about your views, remind us of the kind of pressure campaign that was exerted in order to try and get [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=270.71999999999997s)]
*  you fired that led to your ultimate firing in 2021. Where did it come from and what was the [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=280.71999999999997s)]
*  arguments of that campaign? Well it started in 2019. There were complaints about election on [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=284.88s)]
*  Islamophobia where I talked for a brief period on the relationship between Zionism and Islamophobia. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=293.12s)]
*  That complaint eventually after a year and a half ran into the ground and I was exonerated [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=300.88s)]
*  on all charges and it was said by the external QC that I hadn't said anything remotely anti-Semitic. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=307.44s)]
*  But the second element of the campaign against me started, six for that, where I went on a [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=314.64s)]
*  public meeting on a Saturday afternoon and I said that I had been attacked and complained about by [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=323.03999999999996s)]
*  two Zionist student groups, which was true. But as a result of that the Zionist student groups [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=330.24s)]
*  concerned and other Israel lobby groups started to complain about me and asked for me to be sacked. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=338.47999999999996s)]
*  They encouraged others to do so. Zionist professors at my university called for me to be sacked. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=343.44s)]
*  Zionist professors around the world called for me to be sacked. More than 100 members of the [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=348.64s)]
*  Houses of Lords and Commons in London called for me to be sacked and the university was pressured [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=353.59999999999997s)]
*  by some of its funding agencies that they would withdraw funding should I not be sacked. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=360.08s)]
*  That pressure of course had its effect. They had a further investigation where it was determined [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=366.24s)]
*  that I had not said anything, which was in any way anti-Semitic. But they determined nevertheless [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=371.92s)]
*  that because my statements had made some students upset or caused them to feel what they said was [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=377.12s)]
*  unsafe, that was the reason enough to sack me. And so they did. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=385.04s)]
*  I mean there is an irony here because for so long the American right in particular, but I think the [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=391.12s)]
*  European right as well has been very opposed to this idea that students on college campuses who [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=397.76000000000005s)]
*  are adults have the right to feel quote-unquote safe and that complaints by them that they are [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=405.20000000000005s)]
*  unsafe as a result of having to hear political views that make them uncomfortable [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=411.6s)]
*  is essentially the kind of whining that if we listen to we will cleanse and purge academia of [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=415.6s)]
*  all vibrant debate. Just to be clear there were two different tribunals at the university, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=421.44s)]
*  one of which said you've done nothing wrong at the beginning and the second of which as the [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=429.68s)]
*  pressure grew said you should be fired, but is it true that both of them emphatically cleared you [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=433.28000000000003s)]
*  of any charges of anti-Semitism? In other words found that what you were saying was not anti-Semitic [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=440.32s)]
*  but that the university should fire you because some students felt unsafe from hearing your views. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=445.84s)]
*  Well so what happened was the tie was investigated three times by the university, once [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=452.08s)]
*  by an internal university decision maker who found I hadn't been anti-Semitic, then twice by an [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=456.56s)]
*  external QC who found that nothing I had said including statements I've made over some many [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=464.88s)]
*  years nothing I had said had any anti-Semitic, but they then in the third investigation the one [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=471.2s)]
*  which led to me being fired they added in some investigation of the effects that my words had [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=478.24s)]
*  had on students although they acknowledged they weren't anti-Semitic they said that it wasn't [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=484.32s)]
*  appropriate for students to be upset by things that I had said at a political meeting outside of [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=488.8s)]
*  work which were true. So that was the question you know I've been three times now for the fourth [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=493.92s)]
*  time with this court case judgment fourth time cleared of saying anything anti-Semitic ever in [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=500.64000000000004s)]
*  my life and nevertheless I have still faced this entire process of three years of assault and [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=506.88s)]
*  battery on my reputation which has not of course abated it continues today with the response of [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=514.5600000000001s)]
*  Zionist groups to this judgment where they'd simply ignore the judgment and say oh no he's [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=520.8s)]
*  an anti-Semite. So that this is the state of the debate and of course as you say the American [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=525.92s)]
*  right and some others in the free speech debate in the US do have an analysis which should defend [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=532.16s)]
*  critics of Israel from censure and let's hope that it does. Yeah I mean it's certainly something we've [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=539.1999999999999s)]
*  been working a lot on this show of trying to encourage people who are supporters of Israel [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=547.52s)]
*  and yet also supporters of free speech to understand that if you make an exemption for [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=553.52s)]
*  free speech when it comes to this one foreign country you are essentially attacking free speech [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=558.88s)]
*  even though you think that you are a supporter of it. Let me ask you in terms of the effects that [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=564.24s)]
*  this decision to fire you has had obviously you just mentioned the reputational injury which is [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=571.36s)]
*  going to be very great if large numbers of people are accusing you of anti-Semitism one of the worst [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=579.04s)]
*  crimes in the west that you can be labeled with. What has been the financial cost in terms of your [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=583.76s)]
*  career and losing your job and just on your life in general can you talk about that? Sure I mean [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=588.72s)]
*  what the Zionists hope to do in these kinds of cases is to destroy the person who they are [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=595.4399999999999s)]
*  criticizing. They want them to yes lose their jobs, they want them to lose their reputation and they [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=601.12s)]
*  want them to lose the ability to earn a living in the future and that's what of course they've tried [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=606.8s)]
*  to do to me and to some extent they were successful. I lost my job, I had my reputation [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=613.04s)]
*  besmirched, I can no longer get an academic job in a UK university so all of that had very [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=618.16s)]
*  significant material and economic effects on me and my ability to to live in a house and to feed [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=625.52s)]
*  my children. So of course that's something which matters to me a great deal but the other thing I [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=632.16s)]
*  would say about this however is that since I was sacked from the university I have been doing [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=638.16s)]
*  journalism and investigations. I run a show called Palestine Declassified, a weekly tv show [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=644.72s)]
*  where we investigate the Zionist movement and the question of Palestine and so I have been able to [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=650.32s)]
*  spend many more hours investigating Zionism than I would otherwise have been able to do had I still [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=656.8000000000001s)]
*  been in an academic job. So I you know I of course resent what they've done to me but I thank them [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=662.48s)]
*  for that because I have been able to conduct investigations which they certainly do not like [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=667.84s)]
*  and I will continue to do that. So we went through a little bit of the court ruling and I think [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=673.44s)]
*  as I understand it at least one of the reasons why it's kind of historic is because it's the [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=679.12s)]
*  first court ruling at least in the UK maybe in in in Europe to rule that anti-Zionism is basically [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=683.2800000000001s)]
*  part of the umbrella of free speech that it's a philosophical belief or akin to a religious [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=691.2s)]
*  belief something for which one cannot be punished or fired institutionally. What was your reaction [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=696.6400000000001s)]
*  to this court ruling and how is it that you see the implications of it? Well this was a key element [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=702.24s)]
*  of the case. I mean obviously I wanted to establish that I've been wrongfully dismissed and we did that [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=710.72s)]
*  but the key real the key important question here was the question of anti-Zionism. So I [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=715.92s)]
*  maintained I'd been sacked because I had anti-Zionist views. The university maintained [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=721.12s)]
*  I had been sacked because I'd upset students but what happened in the court case was the university [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=726.24s)]
*  witnesses themselves conceded that what made my views so bad that they had to sack me was the [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=731.2s)]
*  anti-Zionist element of them. It wasn't that I'd upset the students in fact it was the anti-Zionist [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=737.9200000000001s)]
*  element and that's what lost them the case. It was their own evidence where they admitted in court [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=742.24s)]
*  that what they said exactly was not true and so that was the that was the basis of this. Now of [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=747.36s)]
*  course that the importance of this is this establishes that under the Equality Act that [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=752.48s)]
*  anti-Zionist views if they're coherent are protected and you cannot sack someone who [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=758.24s)]
*  is an anti-Zionist for being an anti-Zionist and so this will protect everybody who is targeted [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=764.3199999999999s)]
*  by their employers in the UK from now on. Of course there will be further case law perhaps [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=770.08s)]
*  but it seems inconceivable that this will turn back such that anti-Zionist views are held to be [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=776.0s)]
*  not protected. I mean on the contrary we've established a principle and this will now [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=782.24s)]
*  be available to every pro-Palestine campaigner who is targeted for suppression and censorship [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=786.24s)]
*  by their employer. Yeah and again I mean I really hope that people understand that when [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=791.6s)]
*  free speech is upheld for anyone including people with whom you have disagreements or even [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=796.32s)]
*  vehement divergences of views it benefits everybody because obviously it expands and [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=801.36s)]
*  strengthens and fortifies what free speech actually means. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_zcPh-hl7g&t=807.04s)]
