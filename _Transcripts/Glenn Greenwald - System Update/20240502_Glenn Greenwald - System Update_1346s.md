# Congress Pushes to Silence Israel Critics with "Antisemitism Awareness" Bill
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [May 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE)
*  Speaking of the attempt to crack down on people's right to criticize Israel in the United States, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=0.0s)]
*  the House of Representatives today overwhelmingly passed H.R. 6090 that is essentially designed [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=12.72s)]
*  to adopt a radically broad definition of anti-Semitism and impose it into American anti-discrimination [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  law so that if you do any of the acts under this new definition of anti-Semitism, and [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=28.88s)]
*  it includes criticizing Israel in ways that the U.S. Congress considers unfair or unjust, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=36.32s)]
*  you will be deemed formally guilty of the crime of anti-Semitism and can be punished [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=44.2s)]
*  under the law for having done so. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=48.56s)]
*  And I don't want you to take my word for it. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=52.64s)]
*  I want you to see what this law says because there has been a longstanding effort to try [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=53.84s)]
*  and criminalize criticisms of Israel in the United States, especially on college campuses. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=58.72s)]
*  And all you have to do is take a look at the law that the Congress on a massive bipartisan [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=65.16s)]
*  basis just enacted. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=69.8s)]
*  Seventy Democrats voted no, 25 Republicans, something like that. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=71.44s)]
*  It was about 90 members of the House who voted no. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=75.28s)]
*  Mike Johnson led the way in joining with Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic leader yet again, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=79.28s)]
*  in supporting the enactment of this legislation. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=84.68s)]
*  That's one of the gravest attacks, most explicit attacks on the First Amendment right to free [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=86.96s)]
*  speech that we've seen in many years. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=90.8s)]
*  Regardless of your views on Israel, this should be deeply disturbing to you. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=92.28s)]
*  So here is the text of the law itself, quote, House Resolution 6090, to provide for the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=97.03999999999999s)]
*  consideration of a definition of anti-Semitism as set forth by the International Holocaust [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=103.52s)]
*  Remembrance Alliance for the enforcement of the federal anti-discrimination law concerning [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=108.63999999999999s)]
*  education, programs or activities, and for other purposes. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=114.2s)]
*  So just to be very clear, the purpose of this law is not just a resolution to condemn certain [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=117.76s)]
*  criticisms of Israel as anti-Semitic. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=126.48s)]
*  It is intended to ensure the enforcement by federal administration laws concerning education, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=128.24s)]
*  activities, and other purposes. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=135.64000000000001s)]
*  Now this is the kind of thing that is legally barred from doing, and you're about to see [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=137.28s)]
*  that what is barred is expressing a wide range of critical views about Israel. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=142.8s)]
*  This is the definition that the Israeli government has been advocating all around the West to [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=147.8s)]
*  basically criminalize criticism of and activism against that foreign government. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=152.44s)]
*  The resolution goes on, quote, it is the sense of Congress that one, Title VI of the Civil [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=157.48s)]
*  Rights Act of 1964, prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=161.56s)]
*  origin in programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=166.84s)]
*  Discrimination against Jews may give rise to a violation of such title when the discrimination [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=172.0s)]
*  is based on race, color, or national origin, which can include discrimination based on [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=176.48000000000002s)]
*  actual or perceived shared ethnicity or ancestry. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=180.72s)]
*  Four, it is the policy of the United States to enforce such title against prohibited forms [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=184.52s)]
*  of discrimination rooted in anti-Semitism as vigorously as against all other forms of [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=189.60000000000002s)]
*  discrimination prohibited by such title. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=194.56s)]
*  Five, as noted in the U.S. National Strategy to Counter Anti-Semitism issued by the White [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=197.68s)]
*  House on May 25th, 2023, it is critical to, A, increase awareness and understanding of [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=201.52s)]
*  anti-Semitism, including its threat to America. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=207.36s)]
*  B, improve safety and security for Jewish communities. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=209.76000000000002s)]
*  C, reverse the normalization of anti-Semitism and counter anti-Semitic discrimination. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=212.64000000000001s)]
*  And D, expand communication and collaboration between communities. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=218.08s)]
*  Paragraph four is definitions. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=222.4s)]
*  It says for the purpose of this act, the term, quote, definition of anti-Semitism means the [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=224.16s)]
*  definition of anti-Semitism adopted on May 26, 2016 by the IHRA, of which the United [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=229.68s)]
*  States is a member, which definition has been adopted by the Department of State, and two, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=235.68s)]
*  includes the contemporary examples of anti-Semitism identified in the IHRA definition. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=240.16s)]
*  Now, the bill itself does not provide that definition, the IHRA definition, and that's [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=246.4s)]
*  because anybody who read this definition of anti-Semitism would immediately see what a [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=250.64000000000001s)]
*  grave assault it is on core political rights of free speech. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=256.08s)]
*  Here are some of the examples of what is called anti-Semitism under the IHRA definition that [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=260.8s)]
*  has just been incorporated into American law, and the law itself said that they're not only [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=267.44s)]
*  adopting the definition itself, but also the examples of anti-Semitism provided under this [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=272.64s)]
*  interpretation. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=278.96s)]
*  Here are some of the things that you are now prohibited legally from doing in the United States. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=280.0s)]
*  Number one, accusing Jewish students of being more loyal to Israel or to the alleged priorities [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=285.6s)]
*  of Jews worldwide than to the interests of their own nations. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=290.88s)]
*  So if you look at AIPAC or you look at the ADL or you look at members of Congress who [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=295.84000000000003s)]
*  are Jewish or evangelical, if you look at Ben Shapiro and you want to argue, you know [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=301.04s)]
*  what, it seems to me as though they're prioritizing the interests of this foreign country and Israel [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=307.36s)]
*  more than their loyalty to the United States, this is now illegal. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=314.48s)]
*  You are illegally barred from saying it. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=317.92s)]
*  You will be formally and officially accused of anti-Semitic, of anti-Semitism if you make [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=319.84000000000003s)]
*  those claims against Barry Weiss or Ben Shapiro or Chuck Schumer or the ADL. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=324.96000000000004s)]
*  That's not allowed. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=329.28000000000003s)]
*  Also not allowed, quote, denying the Jewish people their right of self-determination, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=331.12s)]
*  e.g. by claiming that the existence of a state of Israel is a racist endeavor. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=334.64000000000004s)]
*  What if you think that the creation of the Israeli state was wrong [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=340.40000000000003s)]
*  and that the Israelis don't have the right to have an ethnostate led by and composed of a majority of [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=345.52000000000004s)]
*  Jews? What if you don't find that valid or just? You're no longer allowed to express that opinion [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=351.12s)]
*  because that is something that is now deemed anti-Semitic. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=358.48s)]
*  Now you can say it about the U.S. government. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=362.64000000000004s)]
*  You can say, oh, the U.S. government was created by colonizing the land and genociding the Native [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=365.68s)]
*  Americans and therefore the creation of the United States was unjust. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=371.36s)]
*  You're allowed to say that. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=375.28000000000003s)]
*  That's perfectly legal. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=376.16s)]
*  You can say that about any other country you want, too. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=378.32s)]
*  You can say it about Egypt or Saudi Arabia. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=381.92s)]
*  I think the creation of those states were artificial. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=384.16s)]
*  You can say it about Pakistan, whatever country you want, just not Israel. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=387.36s)]
*  Here's another thing you're not allowed to do. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=392.47999999999996s)]
*  Applying double standards by requiring Israel a behavior not expected or demanded of any other [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=394.4s)]
*  democratic nation. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=401.03999999999996s)]
*  So if the Congress or the courts or prosecutors believe that you are making criticism of Israel, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=402.0s)]
*  that you don't consistently apply to other countries, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=410.64s)]
*  you can now be found to be in violation of federal law by being an anti-Semite. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=414.08000000000004s)]
*  You're allowed to put burdens on China that you don't put on other countries. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=419.20000000000005s)]
*  You're allowed to put them on Peru or South Korea or Norway or any other country you want. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=422.56s)]
*  You're just not legally allowed to express criticism of Israel that the government might [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=430.08000000000004s)]
*  believe is unfair because you're imposing on them a burden that you don't apply equally [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=435.04s)]
*  to other democratic countries. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=439.12s)]
*  Here's another thing you're not allowed to do under federal laws enacted by the House of [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=440.4s)]
*  Representatives today. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=444.56s)]
*  Quote, drawn comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=445.35999999999996s)]
*  Now, the whole point of the Nuremberg trials, and if you haven't read those judgments and the [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=452.15999999999997s)]
*  transcripts of the proceedings, I really encourage you to do so. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=458.71999999999997s)]
*  I've written about it many times. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=461.03999999999996s)]
*  The point of the Nuremberg trials is that the Nuremberg trials are not just a matter of [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=464.56s)]
*  the point of the Nuremberg trials, which convicted all kinds of officials of the Nazi [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=469.04s)]
*  regime of crimes against humanity and executed them on that basis. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=475.68s)]
*  The point of the Nuremberg trials was not that it is a unique evil to commit atrocities against [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=480.16s)]
*  the Jewish people, nor was it that Germans or Christians are uniquely likely to commit [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=487.44000000000005s)]
*  atrocities. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=497.92s)]
*  The purpose of the Nuremberg trials explicitly stated was that the atrocities we saw in World [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=499.36s)]
*  War II are ones that come from human nature and that we need laws and conventions in place to [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=505.84000000000003s)]
*  make it a crime, a war crime, a crime against humanity for any country to engage in those war [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=512.88s)]
*  crimes. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=518.16s)]
*  And the Nuremberg trials specifically said the judgment that we are imposing today will have no [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=519.04s)]
*  moral validity, no legal or ethical validity unless it's applied equally in the future to the [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=525.2s)]
*  countries that now sit in judgment, meaning that if the United States or France or Russia or Israel [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=532.08s)]
*  in the future commits acts of genocide or atrocities and crimes of humanity, they have to be [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=539.2800000000001s)]
*  equally liable to being subjected to those laws that were created after World War II. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=545.44s)]
*  And yet, under federal law, as it's now passed, you're not allowed to say that what the Israelis [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=551.0400000000001s)]
*  are doing to the Palestinians seems similar in kind to what the Nazis did to the Jews. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=558.32s)]
*  That's a prohibited opinion in the United States. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=563.2800000000001s)]
*  You are not allowed to say that. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=566.24s)]
*  You can accuse Argentina of acting like Nazis. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=569.12s)]
*  You can accuse the UK of that if you want. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=572.08s)]
*  You can accuse the Russians of it if you like. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=575.2s)]
*  You can accuse the Ukrainians of that as well if you like. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=578.1600000000001s)]
*  You can point out that the Ukrainians have neo-Nazi battalions in it. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=580.48s)]
*  You can say it about any country you want, including the United States. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=585.44s)]
*  You just can't say it about Israel. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=588.48s)]
*  Otherwise, you will be in violation of federal law. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=591.2s)]
*  One of the members of Congress, one of the few Republicans who opposed this was Congressman [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=596.08s)]
*  Thomas Massie of Kentucky, unsurprisingly. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=601.76s)]
*  And in a tweet, he said, quote, the following, Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic minority leader, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=604.72s)]
*  says at a press conference that he will vote for the Anti-Semitism Awareness Act. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=608.56s)]
*  There is some opposition among Democrats to it, though one house dem tells Axios they [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=614.3199999999999s)]
*  expect, quote, a lot of their colleagues to vote for it with Jeffries on board. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=618.7199999999999s)]
*  So yet again, Mike Johnson, says Congress Massie, encounters opposition from several [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=624.4799999999999s)]
*  Republicans to a hate speech bill that many of us believe is a violation of the First Amendment. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=628.3199999999999s)]
*  And Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic leader, offers to bail out Mike Johnson again [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=632.64s)]
*  by providing Democratic votes. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=637.44s)]
*  And that's exactly what happened. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=638.88s)]
*  Mike Johnson was able to get this bill passed, even though there were 20 members of his caucus [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=639.76s)]
*  opposed to it and 70 members of the Democratic caucus opposed to it on free speech grounds. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=645.6s)]
*  Because yet again, Democrats saved Mike Johnson. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=652.5600000000001s)]
*  Now, I was actually relieved and happy to see that there were some prominent conservatives who [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=655.12s)]
*  rose up in very vocal opposition to this bill as a grave violation of free speech, including [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=662.8000000000001s)]
*  people who are very supportive of Israel, one of whom was Charlie Kirk, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=669.76s)]
*  who today wrote the following, quote, In response to campus anti-Israeli protests, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=674.0s)]
*  the House is rushing to vote on a new bill, H.R. 6090. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=678.48s)]
*  The new bill would, quote, officially define anti-Semitism, so the federal government can [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=682.08s)]
*  sue, prosecute, or sanction more people, businesses, and universities for supposed [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=687.2s)]
*  violations of civil rights law. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=691.52s)]
*  I abhor anti-Semitism, but this bill is flagrantly unconstitutional [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=693.36s)]
*  and an appalling attack on the First Amendment. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=697.84s)]
*  This bill would make it illegal to compare Israeli policies to Nazi policies. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=700.48s)]
*  It would make it illegal to describe Israel as racist. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=704.0799999999999s)]
*  It would make it illegal to accuse an American citizen of being more loyal to Israel than to [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=707.36s)]
*  the United States. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=711.1999999999999s)]
*  All of those behaviors might be stupid or repugnant, but they are indisputably protected [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=712.0s)]
*  by the First Amendment. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=716.56s)]
*  Yet now, congressional Republicans are rushing to gut the First Amendment [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=718.48s)]
*  in order to pass a European-style ban on hate speech. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=722.3199999999999s)]
*  I don't know why that's so difficult for conservatives to say because they've been [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=727.36s)]
*  marching around saying how much they hate censorship and believe in free speech, and [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=735.84s)]
*  yet so many of them now stand by and support what is such a flagrant attack on free speech, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=740.24s)]
*  basically an announcement that it's more important to shield this foreign government of Israel [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=746.08s)]
*  from criticism than it is to preserve and protect the free speech rights of American citizens. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=751.28s)]
*  In other words, they seem more loyal to the interests of Israel than they do to the American [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=756.56s)]
*  people, something that under this law I would not be allowed to say any longer, especially if the [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=761.52s)]
*  people about whom I'm saying it happen to be Jewish. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=766.24s)]
*  Matt Walz of the Daily Wire actually posted a similar, even more assertive denunciation of this [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=769.12s)]
*  law saying that it's a grave attack on free speech. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=774.96s)]
*  Now here's the House roll call vote, and there you see it passed overwhelmingly. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=777.6800000000001s)]
*  187 Republicans voted yes, 21 Republicans voted no, 133 Democrats voted yes, 70 Democrats [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=783.12s)]
*  voted no, and the total was 320 to 91. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=793.52s)]
*  So you have more Democrats opposing this, and the reason is obvious. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=796.8s)]
*  They've been far more supportive of censorship when it comes to right-wing speech, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=800.24s)]
*  and the Republicans have been objecting, but now it's reversed because there's a lot more support [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=806.7199999999999s)]
*  for Israel and the Republican Party, so they're happy to limit and legally prohibit criticism of [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=811.04s)]
*  Israel, whereas there's more opposition in the Democratic Party, yet both parties provided [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=816.3199999999999s)]
*  overwhelming support for this bill and enabled it to pass by a massive margin. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=821.2s)]
*  I've been warning for years that the threat to criminalize Israel criticism and anti-Israel [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=828.4000000000001s)]
*  activism in the West is the single greatest threat to free speech in the West. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=835.6800000000001s)]
*  Here is an article as just one example that I wrote in The Intercept in February of 2016, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=840.6400000000001s)]
*  there you see the title, the greatest threat to free speech in the West, criminalizing activism [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=846.08s)]
*  against Israeli occupation. There is a coordinated and well-financed campaign led by Israel and its [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=850.48s)]
*  supporters literally to criminalize political speech and activism against Israeli occupation. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=856.72s)]
*  Now, a lot of this was led by Israel that many years ago began criminalizing criticism of their [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=864.4s)]
*  own country, of their own government, attempts to engage in activism, to boycott Israel, to stop the [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=871.52s)]
*  occupation of the West Bank here in the New York Times July 2011, an op-ed entitled Not Befitting a [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=876.88s)]
*  Democracy, quote, Israel's reputation as a vibrant democracy has been seriously tarnished by a new [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=885.12s)]
*  law intended to stifle outspoken critics of its occupation of the West Bank. The law approved in [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=891.04s)]
*  a 47 to 38 vote by parliament effectively bans any public call for a boycott, economic, cultural, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=896.8s)]
*  academic against Israel or its West Bank settlements making such action a punishable offense. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=902.56s)]
*  It would enable Israeli citizens to bring civil suits against people and organizations [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=908.9599999999999s)]
*  instigating such boycotts and subject violators to monetary penalties. Now, it's one thing for, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=913.04s)]
*  do we have that now? All right, let me put this Mal Walsh tweet on the screen just because it's [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=921.52s)]
*  such a clear example of somebody, a prominent voice on the right, denouncing this law. I can't see it. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=927.68s)]
*  The vast majority of Republicans just voted, he said, for a bill to criminalize criticism [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=940.7199999999999s)]
*  of the Israeli government. If this bill passes, it will, oh, if this passes, you'll be guilty [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=947.5999999999999s)]
*  of hate speech. If you apply double standards to the government of Israel or accuse it of genocide, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=956.56s)]
*  this is honestly one of the most insane pieces of legislation I've ever seen. And he's exactly right. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=964.2399999999999s)]
*  The problem is there are very few people on the right willing to say that. Now, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=973.04s)]
*  as I just showed, Israel was the one that initiated this idea that activism against its [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=977.4399999999999s)]
*  occupation of the West Bank should be declared criminal. And it began then pressuring the West [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=983.52s)]
*  to adopt it. And the West began doing so. Here from the Independent, the British newspaper in [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=988.16s)]
*  February of 2016, quote, Israel boycott ban, shunning Israeli goods to become a criminal offense for [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=992.7199999999999s)]
*  public bodies and student unions. Local councils, public bodies, and even some universities student [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=999.68s)]
*  unions are to be banned by law from boycotting, quote, unethical companies as part of a [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=1006.0s)]
*  controversial crackdown being announced by the government, the British government. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=1011.68s)]
*  Under the plan, all publicly funded institutions will lose the freedom to refuse to buy goods and [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=1015.68s)]
*  services from companies involved in the arms trade, fossil fuels, tobacco product, or Israeli [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=1020.2399999999999s)]
*  settlements in the occupied West Bank. Any public bodies that continue to pursue boycotts will face, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=1025.12s)]
*  quote, severe penalties, minister said. Senior government sources said they were cracking down [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=1030.3999999999999s)]
*  on town hall boycotts because they, quote, undermine good community relations, poison and [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=1035.9199999999998s)]
*  polarized debate, and fueled anti-Semitism. There were actual criminal prosecutions throughout Europe [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=1040.56s)]
*  of activists who advocated a boycott of Israel in order to stop the occupation of the West Bank. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=1049.6s)]
*  They were criminally prosecuted as criminal anti-Semites. Here from the Jewish outlet, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=1056.6399999999999s)]
*  The Forward, in October of 2015, there you see the headline, quote, France Court upholds a, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=1062.8s)]
*  quote, BDS's discrimination ruling. France's highest court of appeals confirmed earlier rulings [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=1069.44s)]
*  that found that promoters of a boycott against Israel are guilty of inciting hate or discrimination. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=1075.76s)]
*  The ruling passed on Tuesday by the Paris-based court of cessation confirmed the November 20th [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=1081.44s)]

*  them prosecuted, quote, the individuals arrived at the supermarket wearing shirts emblazoned with [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=1098.64s)]
*  the words, quote, long live Palestine, boycott Israel. They also handed out fliers that said, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=1105.0400000000002s)]
*  quote, buying Israeli product means legitimizing crimes in Gaza. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=1111.2s)]
*  They were criminally prosecuted for wearing t-shirts that advocated a boycott of Israel and called for [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=1118.24s)]
*  the freeing of Palestine. Is that something you want in the United States? Because whether or not [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=1123.44s)]
*  it is, it's what we now have. And this is hardly the first law designed to do that, as we've reported [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=1128.96s)]
*  many times before. Many red states, legislatures, and governors, along with Andrew Cuomo in New York, [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=1135.52s)]
*  legally banned the state from offering any contracts to anybody who was refusing to sign a pledge [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=1144.4s)]
*  that they did not support a boycott of Israel. And we reported on cases such as a speech pathologist [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=1153.44s)]
*  in the Austin School District in Texas who had worked with students with speech pathologist, [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=1159.28s)]
*  speech deficiencies and speech pathologies for many years, had nothing but overwhelmingly positive [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=1164.3200000000002s)]
*  work reviews. And when it came time to renew her contract for the 10th or 11th year, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=1170.16s)]
*  she noticed that there was an appendix that she was required to sign and the appendix [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=1176.0s)]
*  was essentially a loyalty pledge, a vow not to support a boycott of Israel. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=1180.3200000000002s)]
*  But she couldn't sign it because she does support a boycott of Israel. Yet under Texas law, [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=1185.2s)]
*  anyone who says that they won't support a boycott of Israel, that that's a requirement to employment. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=1191.8400000000001s)]
*  If you're not willing to vow that you don't boycott Israel, you cannot get employment in Texas and in [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=1198.64s)]
*  24 other states. Now fortunately, current federal courts that looked at those laws have almost [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=1204.64s)]
*  unanimously declared them unconstitutional. And of course there will be judicial challenges of [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=1209.68s)]
*  this new law as well. But it is amazing to watch as we discussed in the first segment about the [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=1216.3200000000002s)]
*  protests where we've had student protests for decades of this kind that were permitted because [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBz5UwrL8YE&t=1222.5600000000002s)]
