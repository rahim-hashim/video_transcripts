# Biden VS Trump: Who Delivers for the Working Class? With Prof. Eric Blanc
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [January 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc)
*  Let's begin with this, the 2024 election, which I think was remarkable in so many ways, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=0.0s)]
*  given recent political history where Democrats had basically an automatic lock on, certainly [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=13.68s)]
*  at the managerial level of labor unions, labor leaders were automatically supported by the [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=20.04s)]
*  because the union they represented was as well. And yet in this particular case, we saw the largest [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  labor union, the Teamsters Union, and its president not only refused to endorse the Democratic [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=32.24s)]
*  candidate Kamala Harris, but he went and spoke at the Republican National Convention in a prime [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=38.28s)]
*  time slot, heaped a lot of praise on not just Donald Trump, but other Republican senators who [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=43.0s)]
*  are trying to position themselves as kind of pro-union, pro-working class, rightly or wrongly, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=48.8s)]
*  people like Josh Hawley and his running mate, JD Vance, who the Teamster president said had done [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=55.36s)]
*  a lot for labor unions to stand by them. And then of course, we saw a lot of working class voters [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=61.92s)]
*  continue to migrate away from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party. What do you make [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=67.88s)]
*  this clearly what is a shift in the political allegiances of not just working class voters, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=73.08s)]
*  but also labor unions themselves? Yes, it's a big question. It's an important question. I think the [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=78.80000000000001s)]
*  major story here is that the Democrats are reaping what they've sowed for over 40 years of [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=85.64s)]
*  neoliberal policies, you know, going back to Carter's austerity, Clinton's NAFTA, Obama's [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=92.08000000000001s)]
*  bank bailouts, you know, working class people have not been benefiting from the Democratic Party [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=97.6s)]
*  for a very long time now. So the allegiances that were built up over previous generations, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=103.83999999999999s)]
*  because the Democrats had delivered big under the New Deal, have been fraying for a long time. So [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=109.47999999999999s)]
*  this process of sort of disillusionment is not new, but it has reached a different stage. And [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=113.96s)]
*  clearly the crisis of the Democratic Party with unions is very acute. And we saw that with, you [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=120.0s)]
*  know, Sean O'Brien speaking at the RNC, and we see more generally with a lot of working class [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=126.36s)]
*  voters, including union voters voting for Trump. On the whole, union members still disproportionately [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=132.88s)]
*  voted for the Democrats and had more members, had more workers been members of unions, Harris [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=140.52s)]
*  probably would have won. Unfortunately, only 10% of the workforce are members of unions. So, you [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=147.6s)]
*  know, this was not able to deliver the election, but the general trend is still very, very, very [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=152.6s)]
*  bad for the Democratic Party. I think that on the one hand, it's a positive thing for unions to be [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=158.23999999999998s)]
*  breaking their differential ties to the Democrats, that that sort of policy of backroom dealing and [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=166.16s)]
*  sort of blind allegiance has led labor largely to its crisis where you have so few workers in [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=171.6s)]
*  unions. On the other hand, I think just we should be real, I don't think there's much there there to, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=176.79999999999998s)]
*  you know, the populist rhetoric of the Republicans and on union policies, there is actually a frank [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=182.35999999999999s)]
*  difference. The Republicans have been worse continue to be worse on unions specifically. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=187.32s)]
*  Just like to give one example, the first move of the Trump administration on the NLRB, which [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=192.92s)]
*  governs labor law in the US, the National Labor Relations Board, was to appoint just a management [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=199.64s)]
*  hack, a guy named Marvin Kaplan to the position. This is a guy who just always signs with business [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=205.88s)]
*  over labor. So this is a very, very tricky situation because neither party frankly is [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=211.56s)]
*  representing working class people and unions are trying to figure out what to do. I think it's good [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=217.0s)]
*  to try experimenting, but I'm very skeptical. I haven't seen much evidence that the Republicans [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=222.36s)]
*  are actually going to deliver pro-worker or pro-union policies. Yeah, it remains to be seen. I want [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=225.8s)]
*  to delve into that a little bit more, but before we get to that, one of the things I wanted to ask [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=229.72s)]
*  you is it always seems in politics like things that we talk about as though they're new are [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=233.72s)]
*  actually things that we've seen in the past that a lot of people just did live through or had [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=239.32000000000002s)]
*  forgotten about. I remember very well, not that well, I was very young, not to age myself too much, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=243.88s)]
*  but in the 1980 election and then throughout the Reagan years, especially 1984 when he won that [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=249.24s)]
*  resounding victory, that sweeping victory over Walter Mondale, this phrase emerged that people [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=255.24s)]
*  were referred to as Reagan Democrats. It basically meant people in the heartland who had typically [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=263.64s)]
*  voted for Democrats were part of that generation or grew up with the generation that revered FDR [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=268.28s)]
*  and the New Deal and the sorts of things that the Democratic Party was perceived to have done [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=274.52s)]
*  for people who weren't wealthy in the United States and it created this affinity with the [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=279.4s)]
*  Democratic Party and yet there were a lot of union members, a lot of people who were working class [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=284.03999999999996s)]
*  who abandoned the Democratic Party and they loved Ronald Reagan. As someone who's a historian as [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=289.15999999999997s)]
*  well, the labor movement, what is it that caused that and is that similar to what's taking place now? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=296.04s)]
*  Yeah, I mean the pattern isn't new. The pattern is something that we have had for a very long time [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=303.08000000000004s)]
*  in the U.S. which is because we have a two-party system and because we have a political system [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=307.72s)]
*  dominated by big business, working people frankly get thrown around a lot and get their hopes raised [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=311.64000000000004s)]
*  and get their hopes dashed by a lot of different parties including Reagan. So Reagan was a union [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=317.88s)]
*  member famously. He was a part of the Hollywood union and a lot of unions thought he was going [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=323.48s)]
*  to be their champion and by the end of the Reaganomics experiment a lot of those same [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=328.04s)]
*  Reagan Democrats were disillusioned and they voted for Clinton and then Clinton goes ahead [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=333.16s)]
*  and passes the worst free trade agreement. So the basic pattern is both parties failing to deliver [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=337.0s)]
*  and then workers sometimes forgetting these lessons or trying to see well at least these people who [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=345.08000000000004s)]
*  are out of power, if we put them in maybe they won't be as bad as the last round and so it is [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=350.68s)]
*  really sort of a very vicious cycle in which unions haven't found a way to sort of either force either [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=354.92s)]
*  party to consistently stand with them or to raise a more independent voice. So yeah, I think what [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=361.08000000000004s)]
*  you're saying is exactly right. There's plenty of previous examples, particularly white workers, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=366.04s)]
*  but not just siding with the Republicans, but on the whole this hasn't resulted in a major [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=369.96000000000004s)]
*  realignment of either parties towards working class or union interests. I remember something [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=377.16s)]
*  from the 2016 campaign that always stayed with me because it seemed so illustrative of how politics [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=381.64000000000004s)]
*  works in so many ways. Hillary Clinton had, she didn't visit many states, but one of the states [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=389.16s)]
*  she did visit for whatever reasons was West Virginia and she was speaking to coal workers [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=393.8s)]
*  and the coal jobs in West Virginia that had always been so crucial to that state's economy [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=400.76000000000005s)]
*  were disappearing and she basically told them, I guess being honest actually, look get over it, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=406.2s)]
*  it's not these jobs aren't coming back. We're moving to a different kind of an economy, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=412.6s)]
*  a greener economy, coal is not part of the future and about three weeks later Donald Trump came to [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=416.68s)]
*  West Virginia and said exactly the opposite. He said we're going to save your coal jobs. We know [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=425.4s)]
*  that you're suffering, you've been deindustrialized. He blamed NAFTA and the Clintons and he said we're [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=430.36s)]
*  going to bring back your coal jobs and then I remember a group of coal miners workers being [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=435.72s)]
*  interviewed by media and were asked about that and they said they were asked do they believe Trump [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=441.16s)]
*  when he says we're going to bring your jobs back and they basically said no actually I don't really [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=445.88s)]
*  believe him but at least he is speaking to our problem. He's recognizing what we're going through [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=452.04s)]
*  and he's not just telling us to get over it and it created this kind of affinity for Trump [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=457.64s)]
*  because I do think people want to feel like they're being cared about and seen and at the [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=461.96s)]
*  same time the Democratic Party with Chuck Schumer saying things like yeah for every working class [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=467.64s)]
*  voter that we lose we're going to pick up two affluent suburbanite voters and it's going to all [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=471.56s)]
*  balance out and we're going to win anyway. It seems like on some level Democrats have in part taken for [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=476.03999999999996s)]
*  granted these working class voters but also have considered them kind of dispensable and people [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=482.92s)]
*  perceive that they're not dumb especially when it comes to their own lives. Is that something you [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=488.2s)]
*  think that has been going on in terms of the alienation of some working class voters away from [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=491.48s)]
*  the Democratic Party? Yeah I mean it's clearly the case and I would just say that generally speaking [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=495.64000000000004s)]
*  Trump is very smart and actually has a better read I think on the extent of anger and disillusionment [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=503.88s)]
*  and anxiety and insecurity of working class people of all backgrounds frankly in the U.S. and he's [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=511.72s)]
*  able to speak to that and so people feel heard and again I don't think there's much substance to it [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=516.52s)]
*  based on his last record but I think what you pinpoint is real is that unlike the Democrats [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=521.8s)]
*  Trump has been able to very explicitly articulate and name and sort of say he's hearing working [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=526.68s)]
*  class people and that after you feel like you've been ignored for decades then yeah it's [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=532.68s)]
*  understandable why people would respond positively to that even if they haven't seen the policy [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=538.68s)]
*  changes in their lives at least it feels like somebody up there is listening right and the [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=543.9599999999999s)]
*  Democrats haven't done themselves any favors by this frankly you know and it's really [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=549.0799999999999s)]
*  in some ways baffling that they've given the mantle of anti-establishment working class politics to [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=555.8s)]
*  the Republicans you know and then the Democrats paint themselves as the defender of the status [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=563.64s)]
*  quo and that makes sense if you're doing well and it makes sense if you're a billionaire it makes [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=567.16s)]
*  sense maybe even if you're like a upper middle class person doing basically fine but there's [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=571.0s)]
*  just a huge chasm with working class people who don't feel like they're doing fine who feel like [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=576.76s)]
*  they're struggling to get by and whichever party is able to sort of speak to that and give it a [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=580.76s)]
*  political voice is going to do well electorally and I think we're seeing that over the last few years [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=585.64s)]
*  you referenced this a little bit earlier so I just want to drill down a little bit on it [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=590.76s)]
*  there are a lot of left-wing critics of the Democratic Party who really have become completely [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=595.32s)]
*  soured on Democratic Party politics for a lot of the reasons you just said think their funding and [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=601.24s)]
*  arming and and unconditional support for the war in Gaza would open a lot of people's eyes to what [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=607.0s)]
*  the Democratic Party really is a lot of people think that Joe Biden was a disaster the Democratic [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=612.2s)]
*  Party itself is something that can be reformed and yet even those people the harshest critics [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=617.24s)]
*  I know on the left of Joe Biden and the Democratic Party will acknowledge that one of the areas I [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=621.0s)]
*  mean for me one of the best things he did was Lena Conn and the FTC but a lot of people will say [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=626.52s)]
*  actually even better were his labor board picks the the Labor Relations Board and a lot of these [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=630.92s)]
*  kind of old-school pro-union policies I heard someone this week say that they think the reason [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=641.08s)]
*  for that is is that Joe Biden is just so old that he comes from that era when the Democratic [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=647.08s)]
*  Party was still kind of consciously pro-union there's just parts of like his DNA and his brain [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=652.0400000000001s)]
*  that just those neural connections happen he's like no we're the party of that's pro-union and [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=657.48s)]
*  and it was just kind of an apparition but whatever true there there is some truth to that for sure [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=662.36s)]
*  and yet it doesn't really seem to have registered a lot or mattered it registered with union [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=667.1600000000001s)]
*  officials people who pay very close attention to those sort of things but working class voters a [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=673.32s)]
*  whole even union members it doesn't seem to have had that much of an impact why do you think that [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=676.76s)]
*  is yeah so there's two things there one is I don't think Biden's pro-union policies have that much [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=683.56s)]
*  to do with his age because frankly Biden was VP under Obama which was not a particularly pro [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=690.6s)]
*  you know union administration and Biden hasn't been notably sort of pro-union in this vociferous [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=696.4399999999999s)]
*  way which he actually was last few years so I think the explanation is pretty simple which is [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=702.2s)]
*  Bernie Sanders ran and only almost won the nomination and they had to make some concessions [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=706.52s)]
*  to the left and part of the concessions to the left were the nominations for you know Lena [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=711.4s)]
*  Kahn but then also Jennifer Abruzzo to head the National Labor Relations Board and just frankly [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=716.36s)]
*  the Biden NLRB has been amazing it's been literally the best NLRB since the 1930s and it has made a [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=721.4s)]
*  big difference for workers who are trying to unionize and so the Starbucks campaign the Amazon [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=728.44s)]
*  workers the United Auto workers you know frankly for them it has made a big difference and which [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=735.4s)]
*  is part of the reason why for instance the auto workers even the rank and file tend to devote [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=739.48s)]
*  for Harris okay that being said the big story still is just too little too late it doesn't [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=744.6s)]
*  hasn't made up for the overall sort of cost of living crisis it hasn't made up for decades of [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=750.76s)]
*  sort of neoliberal politics and there's an additional thing which I would add which is that [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=755.64s)]
*  frankly unions didn't seize the opening that Biden gave them you know so I'm all for blaming [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=760.28s)]
*  the Democrats as you know as much as anybody else but there's a certain amount of and actually a [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=765.8s)]
*  major amount of blame to be laid on the doorstep of the labor movement as well because the Biden [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=771.0s)]
*  NLRB created this great opening for potentially unionizing millions more members and if you know [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=775.72s)]
*  union density stays at 10 well then it's understandable why pro-union policies aren't [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=781.24s)]
*  going to be a decisive impact on the presidential election because just the vast majority of workers [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=786.2s)]
*  aren't in unions so what do you do well the labor movement has to grow the labor movement literally [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=791.24s)]
*  has to organize millions and millions tens of millions more workers and that in turn really [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=795.8000000000001s)]
*  would have a profound impact on the overall political dynamic in the U.S. but instead of [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=799.96s)]
*  doing that in part unions have been so used to just backroom dealing with Democrats and sort of [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=805.24s)]
*  deference Democrats they've fallen out of the tradition of new organizing they haven't invested [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=811.32s)]
*  in new organizing even though they have 38 billion dollars in net assets and so they just [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=815.08s)]
*  blew the opportunity frankly rank-and-file workers from below sort of seized the moment that's what [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=819.72s)]
*  my new book's about but the vast majority of labor unions did exactly what they were doing before [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=824.0400000000001s)]
*  which was just sort of backroom wheeling and dealing they didn't grow and so it's not surprising [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=828.12s)]
*  them that they weren't able to deliver a major electoral one to the Democrats their preferred [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=832.6800000000001s)]
*  candidate let me let me ask you to get back to that that topic that I said we're gonna [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=837.08s)]
*  get to in just a little bit which was your view that I think a lot of people share [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=841.64s)]
*  that although Donald Trump is a very skilled politician I think we can all acknowledge that [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=846.6s)]
*  at this point finally at least with respect to a lot of things including as you said making [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=851.96s)]
*  working-class voters feel like he connects to them and understands them I actually I remember [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=858.9200000000001s)]
*  when I was living in New York before I was a journalist I was a lawyer and I remember one [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=865.32s)]
*  time I don't know why this stuck with me Donald Trump obviously was a huge cultural figure tabloid [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=869.72s)]
*  figure in New York City and I remember he once went to a construction site and and that was a [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=874.0400000000001s)]
*  big part of his business was building buildings was around construction workers a lot and he went to [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=880.12s)]
*  this construction site and afterward he said yeah when I go to these construction sites the guys [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=885.08s)]
*  with the hard hats all scream my name and that to me is the most valuable kind of fame not that when [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=891.08s)]
*  you're known by DC insiders and kind of New York elites but when sort of the average American the [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=896.52s)]
*  working-class American knows you I think he's you know had had this ability to maintain these [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=902.92s)]
*  connections and and and present that way for a long time maybe some of his genuine because of [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=907.88s)]
*  outer borough resentment growing up in Queens and and feeling that kind of resentment whatever it [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=913.24s)]
*  is yes that kind of Nixon anti-establishment or kind of resentment toward the establishment ethos [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=917.64s)]
*  that I think helps in this regard but to me it seems like there's at least some part of the [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=922.44s)]
*  Republican Party which is trying in a more substantive way to get out of Reaganomics the [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=928.36s)]
*  idea that the only thing the Republican Party is supposed to do is help corporate profit and [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=937.96s)]
*  corporate power at the expense of working-class people it was Josh Hawley who was the only one [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=942.7600000000001s)]
*  who stood with Bernie Sanders to veto the COVID relief bill because it had no direct payments to [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=948.0400000000001s)]
*  American workers and then Trump vetoed it because the payments weren't high enough [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=952.12s)]
*  JD Vance is a huge fan of Lena Con has often spoke about that so is Matt Gaetz so is is Hawley they [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=957.16s)]
*  speak about the future of the Republican Party being a multi-racial working-class coalition which [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=963.32s)]
*  is language totally anathema to the Republican Party and I think in politics sort of the more [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=968.04s)]
*  worker the more voters of a certain kind you attract the more compelled you feel to service [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=975.0s)]
*  them in order to keep them in order to kind of placate them whereas if they're just your enemies [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=980.36s)]
*  and never going to vote for you you kind of turn away from them do you see any prospect and I know [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=984.28s)]
*  it's ingrained in so much of us to believe the Republican Party couldn't possibly ever do this [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=988.84s)]
*  that the Republican Party could actually following the lead of some of the people I just mentioned [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=993.08s)]
*  start to be more genuine and not just rhetorical and political and their appeal to working-class [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=997.32s)]
*  voters yeah it's a good question I will say that it's very hard to predict the future so I you know [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1001.4s)]
*  I know just as much as you do as far as what's going to happen I think there's very little [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1009.56s)]
*  evidence yet that that minority wing which you're right does exist will have the potential avenue [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1014.1999999999999s)]
*  to become hegemonic in the Republicans and so just to give you just you know a couple examples [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1022.1199999999999s)]
*  look at the Trump's inauguration right like look who look who is standing with him these are some [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1026.6799999999998s)]
*  of the worst union busters in the whole country you know Bezos Amazon Elon Musk is literally suing [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1030.52s)]
*  to overturn the NLRA the you know the National Labor Relations Act so the people who are in [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1037.0s)]
*  a decisive position of influence at this point are literally the billionaires who would stand [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1042.12s)]
*  to lose the most for mass unionization and who are not just rhetorically but actively as we speak [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1047.8s)]
*  doing the most to try to destroy unions you know Amazon is the worst union buster in the country [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1053.88s)]
*  so given the influence that you know these folks particularly Elon Musk have within the administration [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1058.6s)]
*  you know that's the hegemonic position right now there is not like an ambiguity as far as what the [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1064.92s)]
*  overall position of this administration is towards labor could it change well I would say it would be [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1069.32s)]
*  great I you know I would love to see a world in which Republicans pass labor law reform and you [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1074.44s)]
*  know provide some you know benefits to union workers I think it's possible that they would [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1081.88s)]
*  do that in a sort of nativist exclusionary way which you know could really divide the working [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1088.92s)]
*  class and be problematic in some ways but frankly I just think there is not much evidence of this [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1093.72s)]
*  happening yet because what you would have to do in order to overcome such powerful influences in [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1100.04s)]
*  the Republican Party is essentially get rid of the influence of the billionaire class within this [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1104.92s)]
*  party which has it on full lockdown right now so you know like good luck to them if they can do [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1109.72s)]
*  that I think you know I think that people like Bernie Sanders and others would like to you know [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1115.96s)]
*  get whatever votes they can get from the Republican side for pro-worker policies but just to give one [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1120.1200000000001s)]
*  last example you can look at the way the vote went down for the NLRB just you know a few weeks ago [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1125.56s)]
*  there was a vote to maintain a pro-union NLRB would maintain the current appointees essentially [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1132.04s)]
*  a majority pro-union and every single Republican voted against it and it ended up losing because [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1138.52s)]
*  Manchin and Sinema ended up voting against it well not a single Republican was willing to vote [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1145.56s)]
*  for the pro-union NLRB and so to me this is indicative just of the balance of forces could [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1149.96s)]
*  that change down the road yeah maybe it seems to me you know far less likely than within the [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1153.96s)]
*  Democrats for all of their limitations overwhelmingly minus two people voted for a pro-union NLRB so just [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1160.2s)]
*  you know the evidence we have as far as the relative influence of pro-union forces within [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1166.76s)]
*  these two parties both of which are dominated by capital is pretty clear so I don't really see why [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1170.36s)]
*  we would expect the Republicans more than the Democrats to you know eventually become a pro-worker [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1174.92s)]
*  party yeah that makes sense but but let me just ask though that it seems to me like when we talk [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1179.0800000000002s)]
*  about working-class voters the working class in general there are two very significant changes [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1184.92s)]
*  from how we used to talk about working-class voters say decades ago one is that as you pointed out [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1190.8400000000001s)]
*  only a small percentage of Americans belong to a union now I think previously when we talked [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1197.96s)]
*  about working-class voters maybe in the working class in the 50s and 60s it was almost synonymous [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1203.8s)]
*  with labor unions working-class voters were largely union members now there's a huge number [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1209.3999999999999s)]
*  of working-class voters who are not part of labor unions and so maybe it's possible to attract [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1214.28s)]
*  working-class voters even while still not being particularly pro-union or even actively opposed [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1219.8s)]
*  to unions as you said and then and then the other part of it was and you alluded to this as well [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1226.28s)]
*  is that I think when we talked about working-class voters for decades we pretty much were referring [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1230.12s)]
*  to the white working class and the working class was largely composed of the white working class [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1235.08s)]
*  now it is very multiracial there's a huge number of black and cross voters Latino working-class [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1239.8799999999999s)]
*  voters and Asian working-class voters and Muslim working-class voters and this is a big part of [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1245.6399999999999s)]
*  what we saw in the shift from Democrats to to Republicans is not just white working-class voters [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1250.6s)]
*  but working-class voters of every different racial group and minority group so is it possible [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1256.92s)]
*  to envision a party that is pro working-class without necessarily being pro-union especially [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1267.16s)]
*  given as you document in your book that the percentage of unions has has reduced pretty [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1274.04s)]
*  significantly for a lot of reasons well I mean it depends on what your analysis of U.S. society is [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1279.5600000000002s)]
*  basically if you think that it's possible to sort of systematically raise the living standards and [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1285.96s)]
*  make lives better for working-class people without challenging the power of capital well then yes you [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1290.92s)]
*  know and I think that this is the hope of you know certain wings of the Republicans is that [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1297.56s)]
*  there's a way to sort of coexist with the billionaires while providing maybe some more welfare state [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1302.3600000000001s)]
*  benefits and you know you don't even necessarily as you mentioned need to be pro-union maybe you [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1308.92s)]
*  can get some more manufacturing I think the essential problem just in that power analysis [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1312.36s)]
*  is that experience has shown that in order to really significantly improve you know working [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1318.12s)]
*  conditions and living conditions the major block for that is the power of capital right the corporate [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1323.7199999999998s)]
*  sort of just dominance over everything is what is blocking that and so the question is how would [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1329.9599999999998s)]
*  you overcome that resistance maybe you could do that purely electorally there's not that much [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1334.76s)]
*  experience to suggest that's the case historically and I think still today the major mechanism to [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1339.56s)]
*  overcome corporate resistance so that you can pass all these good things right so you can force [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1345.08s)]
*  politicians to pass good policies despite sort of like big business you know scaring them that [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1348.6799999999998s)]
*  they're going to get you know primaried out by you know some well-funded challenger the way you do [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1353.6399999999999s)]
*  that is by organizing working-class people and that's what unions are so you know I if other [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1360.6s)]
*  people share a different analysis my starting point and I think there's a lot of good empirical [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1365.8s)]
*  evidence for that is that workers and bosses have different interests and therefore is not actually [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1369.48s)]
*  possible to be consistently pro-worker if you're not pro-union and so that's a contradiction I think [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1375.1599999999999s)]
*  that the republicans have and I think that you know frankly if a politician you know wants to be [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1380.04s)]
*  serious about supporting working-class people then you can't do that and say you're also opposed to [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1386.2s)]
*  unions I just to me that seems like a contradiction in terms but clearly some workers [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1391.8s)]
*  disagree there's plenty of workers out there right you know so that's true it's possible [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1396.28s)]
*  yeah it's possible that they'll be able to keep on sort of winning people over rhetorically and [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1401.32s)]
*  through some different policies but I don't think that would lead to the type of transformation in [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1405.1599999999999s)]
*  their lives that you could have if it was combined with a real challenge against the billionaires [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1409.8799999999999s)]
*  and through a pro-union approach. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TFR_xeTfmc&t=1414.12s)]
