# Biden Administration COMPLICIT in Israeli Destruction of Gaza
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [April 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U)
*  But it's so important to remember, I'm not talking here about a foreign war that has [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=0.0s)]
*  nothing to do with you or foreign country that has nothing to do with you if you are [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=9.82s)]
*  an American citizen. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=12.52s)]
*  You're the ones who are paying for this war. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=13.52s)]
*  Your government has supported and enabled it. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=15.76s)]
*  And during the campaign, Joe Biden, who flew to Israel shortly after October 7th, hugged [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=19.12s)]
*  Netanyahu, said, my whole life has been about support for Israel and you're going to have [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=25.28s)]
*  all the money and all the weapons you want until you decide this war is done and kept [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=30.720000000000002s)]
*  his word, gave Netanyahu all the money and all the weapons he wanted. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=35.92s)]
*  In 2024, when Biden realized that at least among some voters and in key states, that [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=40.96s)]
*  support for Israel might actually harm his chances. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=45.72s)]
*  And then when Kamala Harris was imposed once they forced Biden out, and she too, a lot [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=49.08s)]
*  of Democrats, including Kamala and people around her and her supporters like AOC, kept [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=55.48s)]
*  saying, we assure you Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and then Kamala Harris are working, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=61.239999999999995s)]
*  quote, working tirelessly for a ceasefire, working tirelessly. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=67.24s)]
*  And we're going to show you that in a minute. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=72.03999999999999s)]
*  Actually we can show it now. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=74.32s)]
*  Here is AOC speaking about Kamala Harris at the DNC, the Democratic National Convention [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=75.56s)]
*  on August 20th of last year. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=81.8s)]
*  She is working tirelessly to secure a ceasefire in Gaza and bringing hostages home. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=83.72s)]
*  Maybe that smug, self-satisfied smile as she said it. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=93.56s)]
*  I mean, she had to know she was lying. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=100.2s)]
*  There's no way she believed that because it was never true. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=102.12s)]
*  Everyone following this knew it wasn't true. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=105.48s)]
*  Biden and Kamala Harris were not working for a ceasefire at all, let alone working tirelessly. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=107.96000000000001s)]
*  The only time he got a ceasefire was when Trump won the election and sent Steve Litkoff, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=113.48s)]
*  who as a longtime Israel supporter has a lot of credibility, a lot of standing to Satan [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=119.0s)]
*  and Yahoo, Trump wants a ceasefire and forced one. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=124.60000000000001s)]
*  Biden and Kamala were doing nothing. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=128.52s)]
*  And there's now reporting in Israel that the Israelis are saying, we thank God that Biden [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=131.64000000000001s)]
*  was in office during our war because never once did he try and pressure us into a ceasefire. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=138.28s)]
*  Here's from the Times of Israel today. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=143.24s)]
*  Quote, Biden officials vent frustration in dealing with Netanyahu, decried miss chance [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=145.08s)]
*  of a Saudi deal. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=150.20000000000002s)]
*  Quote, despite his animosity toward Netanyahu, Biden stood by Israel through the end of his term. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=152.68s)]
*  Quote, this was the most significant political peril of Joe Biden's political career. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=158.44s)]
*  The easiest thing for Joe Biden to do if he was worried about the voters in Michigan is [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=162.2s)]
*  to basically get a little soft. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=166.68s)]
*  He refused to do it, former ambassador Thomas Neid said. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=168.2s)]
*  Quote, there was an enormous pressure on Biden inside the White House to change his position. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=173.23999999999998s)]
*  So when I hear comments about how he wasn't good enough or how he didn't have Israel's [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=178.2s)]
*  back, am I disgusted by it? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=181.88s)]
*  100%. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=184.04s)]
*  Is it true? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=185.23999999999998s)]
*  100%. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=186.36s)]
*  No. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=187.56s)]
*  Former ambassador Michael Herzog too made a point of summarizing Biden's perilous term [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=191.88000000000002s)]
*  positively. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=198.84s)]
*  This is what ambassador Herzog said. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=199.56s)]
*  Quote, God did the state of Israel a favor that Biden was president during this period. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=202.44000000000003s)]
*  Let me just emphasize that. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=208.92000000000002s)]
*  Remember, we just showed you Kamala Harris, AOC saying, Biden and Harris are working day [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=211.16s)]
*  and night for a ceasefire. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=217.56s)]
*  He said, God did the state of Israel a favor that Biden was the president during this period [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=218.6s)]
*  because it could have been much worse. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=224.68s)]
*  We fought in Gaza for over a year and the administration never came to us and said, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=227.0s)]
*  quote, ceasefire now. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=234.84s)]
*  It never did. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=236.12s)]
*  And that's not to be taken for granted. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=238.6s)]
*  The former Israeli ambassador said. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=240.84s)]
*  So the Israelis are saying, including the people, these are ambassadors between Israel [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=242.52s)]
*  and the United States. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=246.04s)]
*  They're saying, never once did Biden even suggest to us that we should do a ceasefire. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=247.48000000000002s)]
*  And it's a gift that God gave to Israel that Joe Biden was president during this war. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=253.08s)]
*  And then you had AOC, not just at the DNC, but many other times. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=261.56s)]
*  A lot of left liberal influencers claiming to be so concerned about the war in Gaza, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=265.8s)]
*  but absolutely lying about it and exploiting it to try and get democratic votes, telling people [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=270.44s)]
*  Kamala Harris is going to be different than Joe Biden in Israel. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=274.6s)]
*  She's working tirelessly for a ceasefire. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=277.16s)]
*  And the Israelis are like, for the whole time Biden was president, the United States never [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=280.68s)]
*  came to us and said, hey, you should have a ceasefire. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=284.92s)]
*  Here's an Israeli, Shaiyil Ben-Effraim. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=289.88s)]
*  And when I say he's an Israeli, I mean, he's a Zionist. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=293.64s)]
*  He vehemently believes that the state of Israel needs to exist as a Jewish dominated state. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=296.36s)]
*  He denounced October 7th as a horrific war crime, believes that Hamas is the epitome of evil. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=305.24s)]
*  And this is what he said yesterday after all this news that we just showed you. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=313.24s)]
*  This is what he said, quote, it took me a long time to get to this point, but it's time to face it. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=318.44s)]
*  Israel is committing genocide in Gaza. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=323.32s)]
*  Between the indiscriminate bombing of hospitals, the starvation of the population, plans for ethnic [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=326.92s)]
*  cleansing, slaughter of aid workers and coverups, there is no escaping it. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=331.71999999999997s)]
*  Israel is trying to eradicate the Palestinian people. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=335.8s)]
*  We can't stop it unless we admit it. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=338.28s)]
*  It took him 17 months, 16 months into this atrocious war. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=343.32s)]
*  He obviously doesn't want to acknowledge this. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=351.72s)]
*  He doesn't want to admit that. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=355.0s)]
*  And he's saying, look, I've resisted this for so long. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=355.96000000000004s)]
*  And again, this supporter of Israel, an Israeli Jewish citizen, who's saying, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=360.92s)]
*  it's just time to face facts. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=368.36s)]
*  There's no denying it any longer. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=369.8s)]
*  Our country is committing genocide in Gaza. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=371.08000000000004s)]
*  And I know there are a lot of people critical of Israel who don't like that word genocide. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=374.44s)]
*  I had Professor Mir Sheimran a couple weeks ago to explain why he believes it's not only [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=377.32s)]
*  so applicable but so important to call it that. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=381.4s)]
*  Because again, it's the United States enabling it, paying for it, defending it, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=386.28s)]
*  protecting it in every way. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=393.0s)]
*  And there's no longer any doubt about the Israeli aim. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=395.88s)]
*  It is to cleanse Gaza of all Palestinians, to make life impossible for Palestinians [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=398.44s)]
*  to remain in Gaza, clear them out, and just have Israeli moves in and annex Gaza for the Israelis. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=403.4s)]
*  I mean, Trump said it. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=411.96s)]
*  The Israelis are saying it. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=413.88s)]
*  How much more do you need to understand that ethnic cleansing, eradicating the Palestinian people, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=415.71999999999997s)]
*  and stealing Gaza for Israel, which was never supposed to be part of Israel from the beginning, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=422.04s)]
*  it was always going to compose a Palestinian state along with the West Bank. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=429.08s)]
*  The West Bank is on its way to full Israeli annexation. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=432.12s)]
*  Settlers are now completely emboldened. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=437.32s)]
*  They attack Palestinians every day violently while the IDF protects them. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=439.24s)]
*  And the Israelis have a vision, and they had it before October 7th. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=446.52s)]
*  October 7th is what permitted them to do it. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=451.0s)]
*  It was the pretext, sort of like neocons wanted to go attack Iraq [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=454.68s)]
*  and play in the Middle East long before September 11th. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=459.16s)]
*  And then September 11th happened. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=465.16s)]
*  Now we have an event that can justify what we've wanted to do for a long time. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=466.76000000000005s)]
*  It was clear that the Israeli government under NetNahu and the [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=470.28000000000003s)]
*  formation, the iteration that they now exist in, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=473.48s)]
*  with people like Ben Gavir populating the government, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=478.12s)]
*  had as their goal the eradication of Palestinians from Gaza and the full annexation of the West Bank. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uMnjfz9V6U&t=481.56s)]
