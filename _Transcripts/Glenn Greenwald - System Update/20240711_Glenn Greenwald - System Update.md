# Is Joe Biden a "Good and Decent Man"?
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [July 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE)
*  Now, as I noted in that last segment, almost everybody who starts off urging [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=0.0s)]
*  president Biden to leave the race. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=13.36s)]
*  I've seen journalists do this. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=15.66s)]
*  I've seen politicians do this. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=17.94s)]
*  They all start off by saying, George, Joe Biden is a very good man. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=20.92s)]
*  He's a good friend of mine. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=24.8s)]
*  And only then are they allowed to go say he must bow to the race. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=26.18s)]
*  We showed you Van Jones on CNN after the debate when he basically started crying [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=29.42s)]
*  and say, it pains me to say this. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=34.94s)]
*  I love Joe Biden. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=37.1s)]
*  I love the guy. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=38.26s)]
*  I love him so much, but it's time for him to drop out. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=39.26s)]
*  Here's the New York Times, Tom Friedman on June 28th. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=41.7s)]
*  This is the headline quote, Joe Biden is a good man and a good president. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=45.1s)]
*  He must bow out of the race. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=49.7s)]
*  Here is hardcore Democratic partisan Rob Reiner, an actor in the Democratic Party [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=52.14s)]
*  fundraiser today, quote, my friend George Clooney has clearly expressed what many of [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=58.54s)]
*  us have been saying. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=63.58s)]
*  We love and respect Joe Biden. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=64.82s)]
*  We acknowledge all he has done for our country, but democracy is facing an [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=67.17999999999999s)]
*  existential threat. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=72.06s)]
*  We need someone younger to fight back. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=73.78s)]
*  Joe Biden must step aside. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=76.53999999999999s)]
*  Now, I've talked about before just about the herd behavior of these people. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=79.5s)]
*  Three weeks ago, it was prohibited to say this and none of them did. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=85.3s)]
*  And now after the debate, it became obligatory to say it. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=88.34s)]
*  And so they all are saying it. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=90.98s)]
*  It's just they read from whatever script they're told to read from, no matter how [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=92.98s)]
*  much it contradicts what they were saying 24 hours earlier. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=96.98s)]
*  And this is also, this is quite creepy, this idea that you have to profess your love, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=100.74000000000001s)]
*  your personal love and admiration and respect for the politician before you can [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=105.22s)]
*  criticize him. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=109.06s)]
*  It kind of has that worship, leader worship climate that is so deeply unhealthy. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=111.14s)]
*  And yet that basically attaches to not only every Democratic politician, but also [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=117.97999999999999s)]
*  any Republican politician who opposes or denounces Donald Trump. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=122.78s)]
*  We saw that with John McCain. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=129.38s)]
*  We see it with Mitt Romney. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=131.34s)]
*  We see it with George Bush, how Democrats who used to call George Bush Hitler are now [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=132.46s)]
*  willing to say, oh, George Bush, even though I didn't agree with him, is a good and [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=136.70000000000002s)]
*  decent and kind man. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=139.94s)]
*  So what does that mean, actually, when people say Joe Biden is such a good and kind [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=143.26000000000002s)]
*  and decent man? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=148.02s)]
*  Is it that the things he's advocated for in the 50 years he's been in power and in [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=150.82s)]
*  public life, are those good and decent things? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=156.26000000000002s)]
*  Let's look at some of those. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=159.14000000000001s)]
*  Here is Joe Biden giving the response to the State of the Union address by then [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=162.5s)]
*  President George Bush 41 in 1989. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=169.42000000000002s)]
*  And remember when Hunter Biden was involved in all these difficulties and problems [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=174.10000000000002s)]
*  because of his crack addiction, we were told that, oh my God, Joe Biden is such a [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=180.38s)]
*  great man. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=185.26000000000002s)]
*  Look at how compassionate and empathetic he is to drug addiction and to the need [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=185.94s)]
*  for drug addicts to be loved. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=191.54s)]
*  He only extended that to his own son, not to anybody else. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=194.62s)]
*  In fact, with anyone else over 30 years, Joe Biden has demanded that drug addicts [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=198.34s)]
*  and drug users like his son not have any empathy or compassion, but instead be [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=204.18s)]
*  created as criminals and go to prison for a long time. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=208.94s)]
*  And even though in 1989, there was a Republican administration in office, Joe [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=213.18s)]
*  Biden, when he gave his State of the Union address, said that Republicans weren't [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=217.42s)]
*  going far enough in punishing drug users and imprisoning drug users that Joe [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=221.1s)]
*  Biden was demanding they become even more severe in their attempts to punish [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=227.01999999999998s)]
*  drug users, not an ounce of compassion or empathy when it was other people's [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=231.29999999999998s)]
*  families who were suffering from drug addiction. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=235.14s)]
*  Here's what he said in his State of the Union response. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=237.62s)]
*  It has to join us in making a significantly greater commitment to these six areas to [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=239.82s)]
*  stem the rising tide of violence in America. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=244.34s)]
*  And that's what it is. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=248.26s)]
*  Violence. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=248.85999999999999s)]
*  First, we have to join together to ensure that drug dealers are punished swiftly, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=249.38s)]
*  surely and severely in line with what the president is calling for. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=253.57999999999998s)]
*  We have to hold every drug user accountable because if there were no no [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=258.38s)]
*  drug users, there would be no appetite for drugs. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=263.42s)]
*  There'd be no market for them. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=265.74s)]
*  We have to hold every drug user accountable. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=268.06s)]
*  It's not enough to just punish the drug dealers. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=271.78s)]
*  We have to punish the drug users. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=273.54s)]
*  The poor guy on the street struggling with the crack addiction. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=275.74s)]
*  He wanted to throw them all in prison, have no empathy for them, not treated [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=280.14s)]
*  like a health addiction, a health problem or give them rehab. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=283.58s)]
*  He wanted to punish them with jail time. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=286.53999999999996s)]
*  And then suddenly we heard when it was his own son. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=290.42s)]
*  He wanted not to go to prison. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=294.74s)]
*  Oh, he was such a compassionate and kind man, even such a good figure that he [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=296.58s)]
*  understood what drug addicts were going through. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=300.82s)]
*  Listen to what he was saying all his whole life. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=302.86s)]
*  Let's take a look at what the real problem is. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=306.70000000000005s)]
*  It's not just how many people are using drugs. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=308.90000000000003s)]
*  As the president said, the number of people using drugs, cocaine in particular, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=311.3s)]
*  is down in our country. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=315.46000000000004s)]
*  That's true. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=316.78000000000003s)]
*  But the violence associated with drugs is spewing out all over America. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=317.78000000000003s)]
*  And that's terrible. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=323.18s)]
*  I know it's hard to believe, but this very day, the president of the United [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=324.5s)]
*  States will commit more than 100,000 crimes on this day alone. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=329.54s)]
*  And the sad part is that we have no more police in the streets of our major cities [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=333.54s)]
*  than we had 10 years ago. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=338.21999999999997s)]
*  And what the president proposes won't help much. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=339.65999999999997s)]
*  What he proposes is no increase over what the Congress has already approved last [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=342.62s)]
*  year. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=347.3s)]
*  In a nutshell, the president's plan doesn't include enough police to help [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=348.3s)]
*  the country. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=352.38s)]
*  But the president's plan is to increase the number of people using drugs. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=353.38s)]
*  The president's plan doesn't include enough police officers to catch the violent [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=357.26s)]
*  thugs, not enough prosecutors to convict them, not enough judges to sentence them, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=360.86s)]
*  and not enough prison cells to put them away for a long time. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=366.38s)]
*  All right. Now, just the only people who say what a good, compassionate, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=370.9s)]
*  empathetic, kind man Joe Biden is are basically Democrats. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=374.86s)]
*  And if you look at this from a Democratic Party perspective, here he is criticizing [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=379.58s)]
*  Republican president for not building enough jail cells to throw drug addicts and [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=382.78s)]
*  throw drug users into, not enough police officers to fine them and punish them. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=387.41999999999996s)]
*  Now, it wasn't only that, but it was that Joe Biden has long been the leader. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=394.29999999999995s)]
*  Not just somebody who was fine with punishing drug addicts like his son, he has [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=399.97999999999996s)]
*  been the leader and he has been very proud of the fact that he's the leader of [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=404.53999999999996s)]
*  sentencing requiring that drug users and drug addicts be sentenced to many years in [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=409.94s)]
*  prison and taking away the discretion on the part of judges to express any empathy or [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=415.46s)]
*  compassion for them and say, well, I think it would be better for you, given that this [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=420.09999999999997s)]
*  appears to be a health problem for you to go to rehab and get resources to help with [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=424.78s)]
*  your problem. No, that's not what Joe Biden wanted with drug addicts until it was his [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=428.34s)]
*  son and his own family that had this problem. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=431.86s)]
*  This is what he wanted for other people's families. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=435.06s)]
*  Listen to this. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=437.18s)]
*  But let's look at the facts. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=438.78s)]
*  Since 1986, Congress has passed over 230 new or expanded penalties for drug and [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=441.26s)]
*  criminal offenses in this United States. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=449.58s)]
*  230 new penalties. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=452.02s)]
*  And these penalties range from an automatic five years in jail for any person [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=454.38s)]
*  with a with a with a rock of crack cocaine, a piece of crack cocaine as small as a [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=460.66s)]
*  quarter. I don't have a quarter with me, but if you visualize what one looks like, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=468.34000000000003s)]
*  yeah, I do have a quarter. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=472.46000000000004s)]
*  If you have a piece of crack cocaine, no bigger than this quarter that I'm holding [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=474.5s)]
*  in my hand, one quarter of one dollar, we passed a law through the leadership of [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=483.86s)]
*  Senator Thurman and myself and others, a law that says you're caught with that. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=488.94s)]
*  You go to jail for five years. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=494.26s)]
*  You get no probation. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=499.21999999999997s)]
*  You get nothing other than five years in jail. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=501.62s)]
*  Judge doesn't have a choice. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=506.94s)]
*  Now, the fact of the matter is. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=509.22s)]
*  All right. So again, now, look at it from a perspective of these Democrats who are [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=513.22s)]
*  saying what a good, kind, empathetic, compassionate man, Joe Biden is such a kind [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=518.3s)]
*  soul who's always one of the best for the people of this country. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=523.26s)]
*  We've seen Hunter Biden with far, far more than a small quarter of crack cocaine. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=527.3s)]
*  But because Joe Biden didn't want his own son thrown into prison for five years or [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=533.62s)]
*  more, the way all these other people, by the way, overwhelmingly black people, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=539.2199999999999s)]
*  because you notice what he's focused on is not cocaine or other drugs predominantly [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=544.86s)]
*  consumed by white people. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=551.3s)]
*  He was obsessed with imposing mandatory prison years on crack cocaine, which at the [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=552.18s)]
*  time was used overwhelmingly by black people in the United States. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=558.4599999999999s)]
*  It was a epidemic that primarily struck the black population. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=562.66s)]
*  He wanted all those black people thrown in jail. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=567.74s)]
*  He got them all thrown in jail. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=569.3399999999999s)]
*  Even if they just had a quarter of crack cocaine. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=571.9s)]
*  He was so proud of it. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=574.26s)]
*  He worked with Strom Thurmond, one of the Senate's proudest and longest term [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=575.14s)]
*  defenders of segregation and all forms of racial discrimination. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=581.58s)]
*  He came from the whole Jim Crow era and thought that that was a good thing. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=592.62s)]
*  Strom Thurmond did. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=596.0600000000001s)]
*  And Biden not only talked about how he worked with Strom Thurmond here to throw [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=596.74s)]
*  primarily black crack users into prison. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=601.62s)]
*  Kamala Harris in that 2020 debate where she was on the stage with Joe Biden [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=606.26s)]
*  reminded him that he also worked with Strom Thurmond, a segregationist, to [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=609.7s)]
*  oppose racial integration at schools through busing. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=614.94s)]
*  And that was when she told the little story about how only because of busing [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=619.9000000000001s)]
*  that Joe Biden opposed with Strom Thurmond was she able to end up going to a school [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=625.1800000000001s)]
*  that was integrated and that how and she talked about this little girl who only [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=630.02s)]
*  got that opportunity because busing was finally allowed. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=634.34s)]
*  And then she said that little girl was me, Joe Biden, and basically implied that [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=636.54s)]
*  even though he may not be a vicious racist now, he has long spent his career [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=641.54s)]
*  devoted to racially discriminatory outcomes, including keeping schools [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=647.5s)]
*  segregated by race. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=652.42s)]
*  So in what way would if you're a Democrat or a liberal, maybe if you're a [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=655.42s)]
*  conservative, you would actually stand up and say, hey, I kind of like that Joe [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=659.1s)]
*  Biden of the 1990s. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=661.66s)]
*  But from a liberal or democratic perspective, in what way does this suggest [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=663.0600000000001s)]
*  that Joe Biden is a good and compassionate man? [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=667.7s)]
*  Now, I went over this many times, but it really actually sickened me. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=669.66s)]
*  It sickened me when all of those issues with Hunter Biden arose, not just [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=675.9s)]
*  Hunter Biden's personal life, but all the questions about what he was doing in [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=681.62s)]
*  Ukraine and China, the kind of business deals he was pursuing with the [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=684.8199999999999s)]
*  involvement of his father or trading on his father's name. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=689.66s)]
*  And every time Hunter Biden was raised as an issue that ought to be looked at, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=694.5s)]
*  liberal columnists like Nicholas Kristof came forward and said this, as he said on [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=701.4599999999999s)]
*  June 24th, 2023, quote, the real meaning of the Hunter Biden saga as I see it, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=705.98s)]
*  isn't about presidential corruption, but is about how widespread addiction is and [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=712.6600000000001s)]
*  how about how about a determined parent with unconditional love can sometimes [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=717.58s)]
*  reel a child back that can give others hope. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=722.74s)]
*  And there you see a picture of Joe hugging Hunter, and they tried to turn [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=727.9000000000001s)]
*  Joe Biden to this like paragon of compassion and empathy for drug addicts. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=732.7s)]
*  If you spend your entire life throwing drug addicts into prison for a long time, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=738.1800000000001s)]
*  taking away any discretion that judges have and going around boasting of it. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=743.34s)]
*  But then suddenly when it's your own family that might have to go to your own [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=747.98s)]
*  son that has to go to prison, you suddenly turn around and say, Oh, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=751.5400000000001s)]
*  actually, I don't think he deserves prison. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=754.14s)]
*  I'm proud of him. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=756.74s)]
*  He deserves praise for overcoming drug addiction. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=757.58s)]
*  That doesn't make you empathetic. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=760.74s)]
*  That makes you disgustingly selfish. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=761.86s)]
*  It's not a virtue. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=764.7s)]
*  It's not a virtue to only care about somebody and their welfare when it's in [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=765.8199999999999s)]
*  your family or someone you know, but not care at all when you're doing it to [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=770.5799999999999s)]
*  other families that you don't know. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=773.6999999999999s)]
*  That's the opposite of virtuous. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=776.38s)]
*  Here from the New York Times in August of 2015, when there was a question about [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=780.86s)]
*  Joe Biden would run for president in 2016 against Hillary, they said, quote, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=784.54s)]
*  Joe Biden's role in the 1990s crime law could haunt any presidential bid, quote, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=788.54s)]
*  when Joseph R. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=793.9s)]
*  Biden became the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1987, a few months [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=794.62s)]
*  ahead of his first and ultimately unsuccessful presidential campaign, he told [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=798.66s)]
*  AIDS his goals was to enact legislation that would take a comprehensive approach [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=802.62s)]
*  to reducing crime. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=806.34s)]
*  The effort, which is defined much of his time as committee as committee [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=807.9s)]
*  chairman, culminated in the 1994 violent crime control and law enforcement act. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=810.98s)]
*  He's sweeping bipartisan bill that touched nearly every aspect of American [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=816.5s)]
*  law enforcement that was signed into law by Bill Clinton. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=820.14s)]
*  Despite reservations, Mr. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=822.98s)]
*  Biden, who has served as the Obama administration's unofficial liaison to [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=824.26s)]
*  the law enforcement community, has not only stood by the 1994 legislation, but [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=827.38s)]
*  has also frequently taken credit for it. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=831.66s)]
*  As recently as this spring in an essay on community policing for a book of [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=834.54s)]
*  bipartisan reform proposals put together by the Brennan Center for Justice, Mr. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=837.78s)]
*  Biden referred to the legislation as quote, the 1994 Biden crime bill. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=842.26s)]
*  The Biden crime bill, he called it. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=847.9s)]
*  In an interview with Time magazine in February 2014, he said, quote, I am not [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=849.3399999999999s)]
*  only the guy who did the crime bill and the drug czar, but I'm also the guy who [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=853.02s)]
*  spent years when I was chairman of the judiciary committee, trying to change [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=856.74s)]
*  drug policy relative to cocaine, for example, crack and powder. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=860.6999999999999s)]
*  So it's not like something he believed in way back then and then apologized [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=863.8199999999999s)]
*  it for whatever he is somebody who wanted crack users and crack addicts in jail [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=869.14s)]
*  until his own son became one. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=874.3s)]
*  And then the media rushed forward to say, Oh my God, look at how compassionate and [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=876.18s)]
*  what a loving father he is. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=879.06s)]
*  And then even said that anyone raising questions about a hundred Biden's [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=881.9s)]
*  business deals was trying to stigmatize addiction. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=884.5s)]
*  One of the big issues right now is whether or not we should spend huge [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=891.18s)]
*  amounts of money on our military and then at the same time, cut social [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=895.54s)]
*  security and Medicare for seniors. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=899.2199999999999s)]
*  And from a democratic party perspective, this is the ultimate sin to try and cut [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=903.54s)]
*  social security for old people in retirement. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=907.74s)]
*  In fact, they constantly accused the Republican party of doing that, even [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=910.9s)]
*  though Donald Trump ran on a campaign of never allowing social security to be cut. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=914.1s)]
*  Here's Joe Biden in 1985 in the Senate demanding after he was spending millions [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=919.38s)]
*  of billions and billions of dollars on all the words that he supported. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=926.9s)]
*  That the way to balance the budget was by taking benefits away from seniors in [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=930.74s)]
*  their retirement years, even though they had paid for it. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=934.26s)]
*  I, when I argued that we should freeze federal spending, I spent social [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=937.9s)]
*  security as well. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=942.46s)]
*  I meant Medicare and Medicaid. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=943.9399999999999s)]
*  I meant veterans. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=945.74s)]
*  I meant every single solitary thing in the government. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=946.66s)]
*  And I not only tried it once, I tried it twice. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=951.3s)]
*  I tried it the third time and I tried it a fourth time. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=954.34s)]
*  Many, many efforts to cut social security from old people so that we could pay for [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=957.78s)]
*  the words that he was supporting. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=961.62s)]
*  Now, when we talk about whether Joe Biden is a good and compassionate and lovely [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=963.54s)]
*  and wonderful man with high moral stature and great values, there's also this little [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=967.6999999999999s)]
*  matter of the Iraq war, a invasion based on lies that killed up to and about more [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=972.1s)]
*  than a million people, as well as thousands of American soldiers and caused [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=980.1s)]
*  immense chaos for many years in the Middle East. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=983.42s)]
*  Here's Joe Biden in a hearing that he was in the middle of the war. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=987.8199999999999s)]
*  In a hearing in 1998, this is still under the Clinton administration, and he was [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=991.98s)]
*  interviewing Iraqi weapons inspectors, including Scott Ritter. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=999.0600000000001s)]
*  And they were trying to explain to him that they believe that Saddam Hussein [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1003.5s)]
*  has been complying and didn't have an active weapons program, something Scott [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1007.0600000000001s)]
*  Ritter also argued to him in 2002 when he was supporting the Iraq war then. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1010.94s)]
*  And here's the exchange. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1015.34s)]
*  And Joe Biden was one of the most influential senators because he was the [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1016.46s)]
*  chairman of the foreign relations committee. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1019.22s)]
*  And here's what he was saying in 1998. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1021.18s)]
*  The ranking monarch, a member on the committee of foreign relations, or any [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1023.54s)]
*  opening statement he would like to make. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1027.5s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1030.1399999999999s)]
*  Chairman. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1030.78s)]
*  Let me begin by saying, I think, Major, you provided, have provided and are [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1031.34s)]
*  providing a very, very, very valuable service to your country by coming forward [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1035.8999999999999s)]
*  as you have, because quite frankly, I think what you've done is you've forced [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1041.5s)]
*  us to come to our milk here, all of us in the United States Congress. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1045.3s)]
*  I think you and I believe, and many of us believe here, as long as Saddam's at [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1049.1799999999998s)]
*  the helm, there is no reasonable prospect. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1052.7s)]
*  You or any other inspector is ever going to be able to guarantee that we have [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1056.34s)]
*  rooted out, root and branch the entirety of Saddam's program relative to weapons [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1060.9399999999998s)]
*  of mass destruction. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1066.82s)]
*  And you and I both know, and all of us here really know, and it's the thing we [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1069.34s)]
*  have to face, that the only way, the only way we're going to get rid of Saddam [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1072.86s)]
*  Hussein is we're going to end up having to start it alone, start it alone, and [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1077.82s)]
*  it's going to require guys like you in uniform to be back on foot in the desert, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1083.54s)]
*  taking the son of a, the, taking Saddam down. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1088.94s)]
*  You know it and I know it. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1092.54s)]
*  So I think we should not kid ourselves here. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1094.3s)]
*  So there's Joe Biden in 1988 saying, we're going to have to take this son of a bitch [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1097.26s)]
*  out because he's going to get nuclear weapons. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1101.5s)]
*  That was before 9-11, before the neocons, actually that was when only the neocons [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1106.6999999999998s)]
*  were calling for this as well. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1110.6999999999998s)]
*  Anyway, Joe Biden, as most people know, did in fact support the war in Iraq in 2002. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1112.3799999999999s)]
*  And so when you go to assess the character of somebody, the morals of somebody, do [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1118.58s)]
*  any of these things matter? [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1124.82s)]
*  How many black drug users you've thrown into prison for immense amount of time? [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1127.1799999999998s)]
*  How many wars you started? [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1133.94s)]
*  How many people you've killed? [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1135.66s)]
*  The kinds of policies that you've advocated the desire to take away old people's [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1139.5800000000002s)]
*  social security in order to become, in order to fund more wars. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1142.54s)]
*  Here's the New York Times in July 15th of 2019. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1149.18s)]
*  This is when Biden was still a primary candidate in the 2020 race, when a lot of [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1153.18s)]
*  Democratic party factions were already raising concerns about his cognitive [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1157.5800000000002s)]
*  decline, trying to push him out of the race, concerned that he couldn't be Trump. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1161.42s)]
*  Here's what the New York Times was doing to Biden. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1166.14s)]
*  How Joe Biden became the Democrats anti-busing crusader. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1168.78s)]
*  With a school desegregation lawsuit rolling Delaware in the 1970s, Mr. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1173.8200000000002s)]
*  Biden led an effort in the Senate to end court ordered busing. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1177.5800000000002s)]
*  Quote, Mr. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1181.18s)]
*  Biden plunged headfast into one of the most politically fraught and racially [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1181.78s)]
*  divisive topics in America. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1185.8200000000002s)]
*  He emerged as the Democratic party's leading and anti-busing crusader, a position [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1188.0600000000002s)]
*  that put him in league with Southern segregationists at odds with liberal [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1192.9s)]
*  Republicans and helped change the dynamic of the Senate, turning even some leaders [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1196.22s)]
*  in his own party against busing as a desegregation tool. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1201.74s)]
*  Quote, no issue has consumed more of my time and energies. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1205.5s)]
*  Mr. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1208.98s)]
*  Biden declared with a flourish as he opened a Senate hearing in 1981, adding, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1209.22s)]
*  we want to stop court ordered busing. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1213.6200000000001s)]
*  Does that play any role in how Democrats assess his character or is this, are all [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1218.42s)]
*  these things that a politician does, all the harm they cause in the world, all the [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1223.1000000000001s)]
*  destructive policy that they advocate, is this just all separate from how you judge [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1227.5800000000002s)]
*  a person, as long as he's like polite to senior reporters in Washington, the way [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1232.8600000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump isn't, that's all that matters for him being a good, kind, [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1237.7s)]
*  decent person, as long as you're around Washington long enough and you abide by [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1242.3000000000002s)]
*  their protocols and rules. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1245.1399999999999s)]
*  None of this matters. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1246.74s)]
*  All the wars you start, all the people you kill. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1247.8999999999999s)]
*  Then there's his actual personal conduct. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1253.26s)]
*  If we want to say that's really that what matters is somehow the things he did in [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1256.54s)]
*  his political career don't matter, which I think is a very strange thing to try [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1260.62s)]
*  and say, imagine saying, look, uh, Fidel Castro, you may think he killed a lot of [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1264.74s)]
*  people and suppressed a lot of people and maybe did, but like he was a really nice [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1271.3799999999999s)]
*  guy to his kids, to other people around him, he gave charity. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1274.38s)]
*  Nobody would accept that. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1278.42s)]
*  Nobody would say you can separate your judge, your view of his character from [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1279.42s)]
*  the kinds of things that he did. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1284.3000000000002s)]
*  It's only for American politicians where this happens. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1285.46s)]
*  But on the personal level, just let's remember what Joe Biden's character has [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1289.8600000000001s)]
*  long been and still is. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1295.0200000000002s)]
*  He had to drop out of the 1998 presidential race. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1297.3000000000002s)]
*  And the reason was, is because he had enormous amounts of ethical, uh, [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1300.78s)]
*  transgressions, including plagiarism and chronic lying about so many of the [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1307.54s)]
*  things that he said about his own life. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1313.06s)]
*  So let's just take a look at some of these news clips from 1998, 1988, when [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1315.6999999999998s)]
*  Joe Biden started off as a viable, even a leading candidate for the Democratic [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1321.1s)]
*  nomination and ended up pulling out just several months later because of his [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1325.78s)]
*  huge waft of scandals involving his personal character. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1330.5s)]
*  Mr. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1333.78s)]
*  Dumb. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1334.22s)]
*  Senator Joseph Biden may have more explaining to do. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1334.98s)]
*  The new questions stem from taped remarks of Biden during an April [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1337.78s)]
*  campaign appearance in New Hampshire. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1341.94s)]
*  I went to law school on a full academic scholarship. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1344.34s)]
*  The only one in my, in my class that have a full academic scholarship, went [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1347.18s)]
*  back to law school and in fact ended up in the top half of my class. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1351.6599999999999s)]
*  I was the outstanding student in the political science department at the end [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1355.46s)]
*  of my year, I graduated with three degrees from undergraduate school and 165 [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1358.9s)]
*  credits only to 123 credits. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1362.8600000000001s)]
*  Biden now concedes he did not graduate in the top half of his law school class [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1364.66s)]
*  that he does not have three degrees from college and that he was not named [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1368.98s)]
*  outstanding political science student in college. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1372.3400000000001s)]
*  Newsweek says Biden actually went to school on a half scholarship, ended up [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1374.98s)]
*  near the bottom of his class and won only one degree, not three. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1378.7s)]
*  Joe Biden ranked 76th in a class of 85 at the university of Syracuse law school. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1382.46s)]
*  I mean, this guy comes off this whole thing as a flyweight. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1387.8600000000001s)]
*  Now Biden says Newsweek is right. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1390.98s)]
*  His memory had failed him. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1392.98s)]
*  And I'd be delighted to sit down and compare my IQ to yours if you'd like, Frank. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1394.18s)]
*  Joe Biden was victimized by the truth. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1397.94s)]
*  Bye bye Biden. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1400.0600000000002s)]
*  He may not know it yet, but I think this is very difficult, going to be very [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1401.22s)]
*  difficult for him to recover. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1404.3400000000001s)]
*  Is Joe Biden dead meat? [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1405.7s)]
*  Yes or no? [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1407.46s)]
*  I think so. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1408.38s)]
*  Bob? [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1409.26s)]
*  Terminal condition. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1410.46s)]

*  Eleanor? [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1413.3000000000002s)]

*  Morton? [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1416.14s)]
*  Dying. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1416.98s)]
*  I say dead. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1418.06s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1419.1399999999999s)]
*  Democratic presidential candidate Joseph Biden today faces a controversy. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1420.54s)]
*  Three weeks ago at a debate at the Iowa state fair, he used phrases identical to [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1425.1s)]
*  those delivered by British labor party leader Neil Kinnick. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1430.26s)]
*  Biden seemed to be claiming Kinnick's vision and life as his own. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1433.46s)]
*  Why? [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1438.02s)]
*  And then it goes on to just copy this signature speech by Neil Kinnick. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1440.1s)]
*  And all of that created this huge ethical cloud around Joe Biden that forced him [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1445.42s)]

*  And if you think that's just decades ago, he's been continuing to lie constantly, [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1452.34s)]
*  even to the point where the media is forced to admit it, inventing stories about [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1456.82s)]
*  how he's so heroic that he got arrested while marching for the civil rights [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1461.74s)]
*  movement, that he was got arrested while trying to support and see Nelson Mandela, [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1465.58s)]
*  none of which has any basis in reality, but he glides about it constantly. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1469.78s)]
*  That's called a pathological liar, somebody who gets caught lying and continues to [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1474.3400000000001s)]
*  lie. In fact, telling the same false stories over and over. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1477.9s)]
*  Now, maybe you could say, well, look like he's a good family man. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1483.42s)]
*  He loves his children. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1486.7800000000002s)]
*  And I don't know, probably he does. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1487.8600000000001s)]
*  That seems like an extremely low bar. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1489.66s)]
*  Like anyone who doesn't love their own children is basically a psychopath. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1492.8200000000002s)]
*  It's like a natural feeling. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1496.0200000000002s)]
*  You have to love your own children. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1497.22s)]
*  I don't think that's the bar for being able to be a great and wonderful and [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1498.0600000000002s)]
*  person of high decency and values and the like. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1502.9s)]
*  But even there's questionable behavior when it comes to that. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1505.1000000000001s)]
*  Here from CNN in August of 2023, [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1508.5s)]
*  quote, why it took four years for the Bidens to acknowledge their own seventh [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1512.5800000000002s)]
*  grandchild. Quote, Hunter Biden asked his parents not to publicly acknowledge [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1517.26s)]
*  the girl as a lengthy child support battle played on in an Arkansas court, [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1522.5800000000002s)]
*  according to sources familiar with the matter. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1527.22s)]
*  But in recent months, that stance became increasingly uncomfortable at odds with [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1529.9s)]
*  President Biden's image as a loving family man and subject to criticism from [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1533.6200000000001s)]
*  his political rivals. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1538.2600000000002s)]
*  The president began looking to write the opportunity to break the silence. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1539.74s)]
*  Quote, I have six grandchildren and I'm crazy about them. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1542.8200000000002s)]
*  Biden told a group of kids on the White House lawn in the spring. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1546.3000000000002s)]
*  The dedication to Joe Biden's 2020 children book, [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1551.22s)]
*  Joey read, quote, to my grandchildren with six names listed. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1554.22s)]
*  So they purposely just refused to acknowledge the seventh child that [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1560.38s)]
*  Hunter Biden conceived out of marriage because they were embarrassed by her. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1563.74s)]
*  Quote, in public, the White House routinely described the issue as a [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1570.46s)]
*  private matter in which they had no role. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1573.3000000000002s)]
*  Behind the scenes, however, someone Biden's team recognized that the [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1575.38s)]
*  situation was eroding the carefully cultivated family image underpinning his [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1578.18s)]
*  political persona. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1583.14s)]
*  So whatever metric you want to use, like personal life, what they do with power, [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1585.42s)]
*  and I think what they do with power is the far more relevant one. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1589.54s)]
*  In what way is there any basis for saying that Joe Biden is some sort of. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1594.18s)]
*  Some sort of kind, compassionate, good, decent man. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1601.14s)]
*  And that's to say nothing of the fact that many Democrats, people on the left, [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1606.94s)]
*  people in liberal politics have spent almost a year now accusing Joe Biden of [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1610.42s)]
*  being guilty of genocide for arming and funding the Israeli destruction of Gaza. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1613.42s)]
*  Here from the Nation magazine, which is still a Democratic Party magazine, [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1624.42s)]
*  but one more on the left from April 27th, 2024, quote, [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1627.78s)]
*  So does that play any role at all? [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1640.22s)]
*  If you are a Democrat and you believe that the. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1643.34s)]
*  You that Joe Biden is actually arming and funding and enabling a genocide, [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1648.46s)]
*  does that at all incompatible with calling him a good, decent man of high [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1656.46s)]
*  values and high morals who is dedicated to the welfare of people in our country? [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1660.78s)]
*  But there always has been this extremely bizarre attempt in Washington. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1664.78s)]
*  To say that when it comes to American leaders, whatever they do, [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1669.86s)]
*  it doesn't matter if they start wars based on lies. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1672.46s)]
*  It doesn't matter how they kill huge numbers of people. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1675.26s)]
*  If they cause a great recession that makes people suffer for decades. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1677.54s)]
*  If they advocate what people now consider to be racist policies of blocking [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1685.26s)]
*  desegregation, what they do is they advocate for the right to vote. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1689.82s)]
*  Or putting crack addicts in prison for five years and then suddenly [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1694.9s)]
*  stopping when his own son is an addict. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1697.9s)]
*  People in Washington insist that that has no bearing what they do in their lives [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1702.02s)]
*  on whether they're a good and kind person. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1705.54s)]
*  An excellent example of that is how virtually all of Washington considered [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1709.38s)]
*  John McCain to be the paragon of decency. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1712.78s)]
*  In fact, here's the Atlantic in August of 2018, John McCain and the lost art of [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1715.66s)]
*  decency. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1720.7s)]
*  In decades of covering politics have encountered no one with McCain's [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1722.18s)]
*  unflinching combination of bracing candor and possibly high standards and [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1725.54s)]
*  rueful self recrimination. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1730.38s)]
*  John McCain has been an advocate of every single American war, a very vigorous [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1734.38s)]
*  vehement advocate of all those wars that killed huge numbers of people in Vietnam, [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1739.74s)]
*  in Iraq, in Afghanistan, in Syria, in Libya and on and on and on. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1745.54s)]
*  He's also proposed many other wars. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1749.22s)]
*  Remember when he sang bomb, bomb, bomb, Iran during his campaign? [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1751.5s)]
*  Is it conceivable to reconcile that kind of a record as a adult throughout your [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1757.14s)]
*  entire life, wanting to bomb countries, invade countries, kill people, with being [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1765.82s)]
*  depicted as the paragon of decency just because the press corps likes you? [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1770.22s)]
*  When I started writing about politics, it was in the middle of George Bush's [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1773.86s)]
*  second term right at the start. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1779.3799999999999s)]
*  And every day liberals accused George Bush of things like torturing people, [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1782.1s)]
*  authorizing a worldwide torture regime, a worldwide network of CIA black sites [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1786.58s)]
*  where the CIA would abduct people and keep them in secret away from human rights [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1792.6599999999999s)]
*  organizations so they could torture them without anyone knowing, kidnapping [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1796.1799999999998s)]
*  people off the streets of Europe and the United States, and then they would [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1799.4599999999998s)]
*  go to Europe and sending them to Egypt and Syria to be tortured. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1803.66s)]
*  Spying on American citizens with no warrants, being responsible for the [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1809.7s)]
*  invasion of Iraq that killed huge numbers of people. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1812.42s)]
*  And yet now when you hear Democrats talk about George W. Bush, they will say, [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1816.5400000000002s)]
*  look, I didn't agree with him, but he was an incredibly kind and decent person. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1819.5800000000002s)]
*  Now, in part, that's just because George Bush and his family finds Trump vulgar. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1823.42s)]
*  And the only metric that matters these days is whether you condemn Trump or not. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1829.3s)]
*  You could be Adolf Hitler. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1834.58s)]
*  I've often said if Adolf Hitler got reincarnated and he decided to denounce Trump, [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1835.4599999999998s)]
*  he would probably get an MSNBC show the next day. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1840.58s)]
*  That's really the only metric of character. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1842.8999999999999s)]
*  But Democrats spent years comparing George Bush to Hitler, accusing him of [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1846.5s)]
*  all kinds of war crimes. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1852.58s)]
*  And now here's how Democrats talk about the same George W. Bush. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1854.74s)]
*  Here's Nancy Pelosi in 2023. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1857.46s)]
*  I'll just say this honestly, that the Bush family is because of their humanity, [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1860.4199999999998s)]
*  their faith, their generosity of spirit, their compassion. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1868.22s)]
*  Once again, it's an honor to be associated with President Bush in this. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1873.54s)]
*  He said this was his second time to be here. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1878.5s)]
*  I've been here many, many times. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1881.3799999999999s)]
*  So I've been him with him 100% of the times he's been here. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1883.82s)]
*  Because we were both here for the groundbreaking when I was speaker and he was. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1888.3799999999999s)]
*  So what this really is, is just class loyalty. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1894.6999999999998s)]
*  All of these people belong to a certain class. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1900.62s)]
*  We had a video of Nancy Pelosi's daughter talking about how she considers George W. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1902.54s)]
*  Bush her father or a member of their family. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1906.06s)]
*  And all these accusations they hurl at each other is just theater. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1908.94s)]
*  They're all part of the same club. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1913.66s)]
*  They all love each other. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1914.8600000000001s)]
*  And that's why people can stand up and say George Bush or Joe Biden is a kind, decent [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1915.66s)]
*  man of the highest values, even though everything he's done in his life has [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1921.1000000000001s)]
*  nothing to do with that, because all that matters is that he placate and act properly [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1924.94s)]
*  within their Washington circle of power. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1930.14s)]
*  And the reason they hate Donald Trump so much is because he doesn't. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1933.5s)]
*  But it is really bizarre to just completely segregate the assessment of a person like [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1936.14s)]
*  Joe Biden's character from the actual impact he's had in the world, the actual things [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1941.5800000000002s)]
*  he's endorsed, let alone the things he's done in his personal life. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1945.5800000000002s)]
*  And that's why it's incredibly bizarre to watch at the same time, it be a obligatory [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1949.5800000000002s)]
*  vow that Joe Biden be decreed to be this wonderful, kind man of the highest values, [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1953.9s)]
*  the deepest character when his entire adult life, both in his personal realm and more [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1962.6200000000001s)]
*  importantly to me at least, in the things he's done with power, suggests that the exact [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRZ7xVsbykE&t=1970.6200000000001s)]
