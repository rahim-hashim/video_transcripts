# Red State Governors BAN Lab-Grown Meat to Protect Industrial Funders
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [May 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw)
*  Emma, thanks so much for coming on our show tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=0.0s)]
*  We really appreciate it. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=8.44s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  So as I said at the end there, I think you were on when I covered it, there's all kinds [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  of studies. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=18.48s)]
*  I just read one or two that were part of the USDA and FDA approval process showing that [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=19.48s)]
*  lab-grown meat is actually quite healthy. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=23.56s)]
*  That's how it became approved. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=25.62s)]
*  I want to talk about that in just a minute. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=26.82s)]
*  But as I also said, that's not even an issue when these governors and these legislators [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=29.3s)]
*  are enacting these laws. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=34.54s)]
*  They're enacting these laws and they're stating what the real reason is. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=36.3s)]
*  That has nothing to do with health concerns. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=40.58s)]
*  What are the reasons that these laws are being passed? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=42.5s)]
*  So when I've looked at the language around these bills attempting to ban lab-grown meat [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=46.5s)]
*  in different states around the country, there are sort of two main prongs that come up for [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=51.06s)]
*  me. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=55.42s)]
*  First is this sort of anti-competition stance where we need to protect Floridian meat producers. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=57.22s)]
*  We need to protect our agriculture industry. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=63.58s)]
*  We don't want them being replaced with this incursion of lab-grown meat. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=66.3s)]
*  And then also there is frankly a stronger current of just straight up culture war. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=70.5s)]
*  There's basically this idea that the left wants you to eat the bugs. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=75.46000000000001s)]
*  Literally in the press release that Ron DeSantis sent out when he signed a bill banning lab-grown [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=80.3s)]
*  meat, he said it was something about the global elite trying to make people eat the bugs. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=85.38000000000001s)]
*  There was literally a reference to eating bugs. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=91.62s)]
*  And there's this idea that lab-grown meat, it's hippie-ish, it's anti, what red-blooded [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=94.7s)]
*  Americans want to eat, I think especially right now because the right is sort of obsessed [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=100.10000000000001s)]
*  with meat and protein. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=103.54s)]
*  And it's just like an easy culture war dunk. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=105.54s)]
*  I was sort of looking at the comments on X underneath your post about lab-grown meat [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=107.54s)]
*  And people had all of these responses that were frankly very emotional and hysterical. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=111.98s)]
*  They were like, no, it's disgusting, you can't make me eat it. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=116.34s)]
*  You know, it's like, you don't have to eat it. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=120.10000000000001s)]
*  But this definitely should be an option. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=123.06s)]
*  And there's really no rational reason why this shouldn't be allowed to be produced and [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=124.7s)]
*  sold. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=130.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=131.94s)]
*  I mean, it was incredible. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=132.94s)]
*  They were also just spitting out like unsubstantiated claims that lab-grown meat is extremely unhealthy [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=133.94s)]
*  for you. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=138.78s)]
*  I kept saying like, you're inventing excuses that these politicians aren't even citing. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=140.06s)]
*  It was driving me crazy. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=144.54s)]
*  Try not to look at the comments beneath my post on social media because it'll make you [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=146.54s)]
*  go crazy. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=151.5s)]
*  But you know, I have to say there are few people who hate factory farms and industrial [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=152.5s)]
*  farming more than I do. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=157.38s)]
*  I don't even like to call it farming because it really doesn't bear any resemblance to [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=158.94s)]
*  it. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=161.82s)]
*  Reporting on it is what in large part made me become vegan. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=162.82s)]
*  But I would never, the thought has never entered my head, oh, the way to curb the abuses [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=167.14s)]
*  of factory farms or even phase it out is by preventing people, like banning people from [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=173.64s)]
*  eating meat from factory farms if they want. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=178.92s)]
*  Go have a party. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=181.22s)]
*  Go at it. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=182.22s)]
*  Like, the idea was, okay, for people who don't want to go vegan, who still want to consume [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=183.22s)]
*  meat but don't want to encourage factory farms or the environmental risk that it has, science [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=189.66s)]
*  has enabled this new alternative for consuming meat, which is lab-grown meat. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=196.14s)]
*  What was the impetus behind that? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=201.94s)]
*  Why did people feel a scientific compulsion to develop this? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=204.5s)]
*  I mean, I think there's probably an environmental angle to it that's a really big issue, especially [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=208.57999999999998s)]
*  because as, you know, this is good news, as people get wealthier and wealthier, there's [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=215.33999999999997s)]
*  higher demand for meat. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=218.45999999999998s)]
*  But factory farms take up so much land, they take up so much energy, they produce so many [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=220.2s)]
*  greenhouse gases. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=225.14s)]
*  That's a huge problem. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=226.14s)]
*  Also, there are, there is the ethical issues. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=227.14s)]
*  If you are, you know, a cow or a chicken in an industrial farm, your life is miserable, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=230.14s)]
*  right? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=235.26s)]
*  I mean, this is, we'll probably get into this more, but I sort of find it funny when people [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=236.26s)]
*  talk about how lab-grown meat must be full of all of these chemicals and additives. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=239.29999999999998s)]
*  I'm like, do you even know what it's like to be a cow in a cafe? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=242.45999999999998s)]
*  You spend most of your life, you know, in your own excrement. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=245.54s)]
*  Like it's not, it's not clean by any stretch of the imagination. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=248.14s)]
*  They're vile. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=252.45999999999998s)]
*  I've never seen places as filthy and disease-ridden as the inside of farms. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=253.58s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=258.14s)]
*  Yes, yes, exactly. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=259.14s)]
*  And so there's sort of the ethical and the environmental angle here. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=260.14s)]
*  And it's, you know, there's some novelty to it. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=264.18s)]
*  I've tried lab-grown chicken twice and lab-grown salmon once. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=266.62s)]
*  It was pretty good. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=271.34000000000003s)]
*  I don't think it's going to fool anybody quite yet, but I think we will get there one day. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=272.34000000000003s)]
*  And I think you're totally right. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=276.98s)]
*  I think I personally know a lot of people who, you know, they would prefer to eat less [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=278.14000000000004s)]
*  meat, but they can't like fully get themselves to cut it out. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=283.06s)]
*  You know, the idea of going vegan or vegetarian is really daunting. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=286.38s)]
*  And if they had the option to buy lab-grown meat, they would jump at it. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=289.38s)]
*  And it's actually entirely feasible to me that in some number of years it'll be cheaper [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=293.58000000000004s)]
*  than slaughtered meat because, you know, it's a lot more efficient to. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=298.90000000000003s)]
*  So for example, the salmon, they basically grow it in old brewing tanks. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=303.94s)]
*  So one of the places that does lab-grown salmon, it's in an old brewery, you know, to basically [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=310.53999999999996s)]
*  make your salmon filets individually instead of having to deal with raising salmon, breeding [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=314.38s)]
*  them, getting rid of the waste, slaughtering them. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=319.5s)]
*  So it could even be cheaper one day, which I think would be good for anybody who wants [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=322.29999999999995s)]
*  to buy that. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=325.84s)]
*  Yeah, people probably know, like I think even Burger King and McDonald's sell it. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=326.84s)]
*  I think burgers have such a thing as a vegan burger, which isn't even about extracting [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=331.18s)]
*  the cells from an animal. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=335.22s)]
*  You know, it can be made with like pea protein or beans, sometimes rice, soy, whatever. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=336.22s)]
*  And I would say the taste is very similar, you know, especially if you're eating the [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=345.5s)]
*  kind of hamburger that Americans eat with, you know, like tomatoes and mustard and onions [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=349.14s)]
*  or whatever. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=355.74s)]
*  But as you say, the science is only advancing. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=356.9s)]
*  It's still in its incipient stages, but a lot of people have liked these products and [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=359.22s)]
*  have been consuming them a lot. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=362.98s)]
*  So let's talk about the health effects, because again, I can't stress enough to people, because [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=364.90000000000003s)]
*  I know there are people watching reacting to this that way. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=369.58000000000004s)]
*  That was the major objection to my view on this was, no, but it's so unhealthy. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=372.74s)]
*  So what have the studies shown? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=379.14000000000004s)]
*  A, about the health effects of lab-grown meat as compared to, say, red meat from slaughtering [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=382.18s)]
*  animals? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=388.98s)]
*  And then B, just like what is it shown about the health effects or the safety concerns [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=389.98s)]
*  about lab-grown meat at all? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=395.62s)]
*  So the FDA and the USDA have approved two different kinds of lab-grown chicken. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=399.42s)]
*  I think if I recall correctly, it's from upside foods and good meat, which means it passes [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=404.38s)]
*  all of their very rigorous safety standards. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=408.64000000000004s)]
*  You know, maybe the libertarian in me is like, yeah, maybe it's a little too rigorous. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=411.34000000000003s)]
*  But at the very least, it's been approved to be sold. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=414.3s)]
*  There was a limited sort of restaurant-based release of some lab-grown chicken at a couple [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=417.18s)]
*  restaurants in, I want to say, 2023. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=421.42s)]
*  To my knowledge, I could be wrong. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=425.74s)]
*  I haven't been able to check super recently. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=427.46000000000004s)]
*  The salmon, I think, is not at like a full commercial release yet, but it is being produced [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=430.38s)]
*  and on a limited basis. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=434.86s)]
*  People can try it. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=436.36s)]
*  I'm not sure of any studies directly comparing the health effects. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=438.3s)]
*  Right now, I think it's just chicken and salmon, so there's not like a red meat component. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=441.54s)]
*  We have no reason to think that it's going to be more or less healthy. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=446.1s)]
*  It's essentially the same. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=450.42s)]
*  And if anything, especially when you're looking at something like salmon, it's almost certainly [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=451.42s)]
*  going to be healthier because the lab-grown salmon you have is the only salmon you can [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=454.82s)]
*  guarantee doesn't have any mercury. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=459.34s)]
*  It doesn't have any parasites. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=461.1s)]
*  It doesn't have any either industrial junk or floating around in the ocean getting microplastics [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=462.38s)]
*  junk. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=469.3s)]
*  It's actually the cleanest. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=470.3s)]
*  This is something that a lot of times when you talk to people that work in lab-grown meat [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=471.3s)]
*  that they emphasize is that this chicken, this salmon is the cleanest meat that you [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=474.22s)]
*  can possibly buy because it's produced under these conditions where you're not dealing [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=479.02000000000004s)]
*  with animal waste. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=482.82000000000005s)]
*  You're not dealing with blood and guts. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=484.22s)]
*  You're not dealing with having to pump these cows full or chickens full of antibiotics. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=485.70000000000005s)]
*  And so it's actually like if I had to hazard a guess, my guess would be that it would be [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=493.06s)]
*  much healthier than typical slaughtered meat. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=498.1s)]
*  Now, it is amazing to me. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=500.98s)]
*  Sometimes I am very surprised, but I guess it's just the efficacy and power of this industry [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=504.46000000000004s)]
*  that just the pandemic risks alone. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=509.38s)]
*  There's few things more frightening than antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections because our tool against [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=512.46s)]
*  bacterial infections is antibiotics. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=519.3000000000001s)]
*  And if they're resistant to it because these animals have been so pumped so continuously [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=521.1800000000001s)]
*  and you do ultimately become resistant to antibiotics if you're just getting them pumped [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=525.4200000000001s)]
*  in you all the time. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=528.62s)]
*  Is that incredible health risk to humans? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=530.5s)]
*  So to hear them justifying out the health concerns when this slaughtering animal factory [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=532.5s)]
*  farms have that, just that by itself is amazing in addition to all the sanitary issues that [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=536.98s)]
*  you raise. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=542.6999999999999s)]
*  But what about just like red meat? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=543.6999999999999s)]
*  I mean, there's a lot of studies suggesting that people are obese or have coronary problems, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=545.46s)]
*  have heart attacks, have strokes because of red meat. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=552.14s)]
*  Like, couldn't you, if you were really somebody arguing that the state should ban food that [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=554.86s)]
*  is unhealthy, you could make that case for standard factory farm meat, right? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=559.02s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I, I, I, I of course prefer not to suggest that the state should ban any [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=564.1s)]
*  foods. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=571.26s)]
*  But yeah, you know, I'm just saying for people, there's really only, if you're going to go [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=572.26s)]
*  down that argument, there's really only two foods that have been sort of scientifically [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=576.26s)]
*  proven to a degree you can scientifically prove anything to cause cancer and it's processed [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=580.54s)]
*  meats and alcohol. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=585.46s)]
*  So those are really the foods that are that, you know, you would think that the maha people [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=588.4599999999999s)]
*  would be really up in arms about. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=592.78s)]
*  But right now the fad seems to be to eat quite a lot of processed meat because we're obsessed [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=594.5s)]
*  with protein, but tofu doesn't count. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=600.66s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=603.18s)]
*  This is the thing that, that as a vegan with a protein obsessed husband who is also vegan [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=604.18s)]
*  is always confusing to me because we have a lot of protein sources in our house, but [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=610.38s)]
*  none of them involve animals. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=614.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=615.58s)]
*  I just want to emphasize again for people who might be just tuning in or whatever, your [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=616.58s)]
*  preference and my preference, like no one's trying to impose your diet or my diet on anybody [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=620.78s)]
*  else. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=627.26s)]
*  Let me, like if somebody asks, we might talk about the benefits. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=628.26s)]
*  I might write an article about it to try and persuade people, but not to argue that it [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=630.86s)]
*  should be banned. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=635.22s)]
*  And the issue here is not which food is better. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=637.02s)]
*  The issue is what right does the state have to ban food, especially when they're saying, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=639.18s)]
*  admitting that the reason is to ban a free market and to protect the industries that [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=645.7399999999999s)]
*  fund their campaigns. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=650.66s)]
*  No, absolutely. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=652.14s)]
*  There is this bizarre posture taken by a lot of these governors. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=654.62s)]
*  That's essentially we need to ban lab-grown meat so they don't force you to eat it. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=658.7399999999999s)]
*  When of course, you know, you can't go out and buy lab-grown meat anywhere in the United [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=662.9799999999999s)]
*  States right now. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=666.42s)]
*  It's a really infant industry that, you know, I really want it to succeed, but it's entirely [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=667.66s)]
*  possible that there just isn't the demand for it. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=672.2199999999999s)]
*  So they're really taking this extremely aggressive approach to an industry that doesn't have [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=675.2199999999999s)]
*  the tiniest chance of actually harming this like behemoth animal agriculture industry [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=680.14s)]
*  right now. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=685.8199999999999s)]
*  Using this language, you're like, well, we need to keep you from eating it so that way [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=687.42s)]
*  nobody forces you to eat it. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=690.0999999999999s)]
*  And it's like, well, you're the one that's cutting off people's choices right now. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=691.78s)]
*  Totally. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=696.74s)]
*  It's basically like a prior restraint, right? [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=697.74s)]
*  It's for this hypothetical threat. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=700.38s)]
*  You're actually infringing upon people's rights, both to conduct business and to buy the food [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=702.7800000000001s)]
*  that they want to eat. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=708.82s)]
*  The interesting thing is there have been government attempts in the past to either cajole people, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=709.82s)]
*  to avoid unhealthy foods, or even alcohol consumption, obviously drug consumption, but [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=717.26s)]
*  including with foods. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=725.6999999999999s)]
*  And I remember so well when Michelle Obama was the first lady. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=726.6999999999999s)]
*  I never paid attention to her at the time because it always seemed such a baffling controversy [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=730.16s)]
*  to me. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=733.28s)]
*  But you know, first ladies usually pick up a project and the idea is not to be politically [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=734.28s)]
*  polarizing because you don't want to take away from the president's political posture [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=737.88s)]
*  or whatever. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=742.84s)]
*  And Michelle Obama's position was, hey, I think we should be healthier. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=743.84s)]
*  It was basically like R.F.K. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=747.8199999999999s)]
*  Jr.'s view of America, like Americans are too fat, we don't exercise enough, the food [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=749.36s)]
*  that we eat is terrible. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=755.12s)]
*  And I want to get to the R.F.K. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=756.12s)]
*  Jr. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=757.12s)]
*  part of this as well in a second, but I mean conservatives went ballistic. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=758.12s)]
*  Like how dare Michelle Obama tell our kids what to eat, how dare she try and interfere [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=763.36s)]
*  in our private lives. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=768.24s)]
*  And she wasn't doing anything coercive. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=769.24s)]
*  It was just like an educational campaign, like hey, it's good to move, good to exercise, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=771.28s)]
*  that's healthy for you, let's try and get your school lunches, pick the healthier food. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=776.36s)]
*  That was it. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=780.76s)]
*  And then there was also the other example I mentioned, and there's so many of them, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=781.92s)]
*  where Michael Bloomberg as the mayor of New York City, when fast food restaurants started [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=785.28s)]
*  offering these, I don't know, like what are they, 20 ounces or 28 ounce sodas, like gigantic [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=791.48s)]
*  sodas just filled with sugar and all kinds of other substances, he tried to limit how [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=797.4s)]
*  much restaurants can sell. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=802.68s)]
*  You can only sell 16 ounces and not more because of the health concerns. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=804.4s)]
*  And that was something I personally was very opposed to, and every conservative I know [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=808.18s)]
*  was as well saying, Michael Bloomberg thinks he's our father, he's being paternalistic, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=812.88s)]
*  we don't want a nanny state. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=818.2399999999999s)]
*  And now you have, just like a little bit of time later, now you have Republican governors [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=820.5s)]
*  going way further than Michelle Obama went, obviously, and way further than Michael Bloomberg [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=825.4799999999999s)]
*  went who was just trying to limit the quantity of soft drinks by saying, no, even though [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=829.8599999999999s)]
*  it's safe and proven safe, we don't want you buying this product. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=837.18s)]
*  And I don't see any conservatives, maybe a few, but very few, you are one, and I guess [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=840.54s)]
*  you're more a libertarian than a conservative. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=845.78s)]
*  I wouldn't be a self-conservative. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=848.5799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=849.5799999999999s)]
*  So a lot of people consider libertarians conservatives on the left, but yeah, I know the difference. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=850.5799999999999s)]
*  But I'm just saying, it's like, how do people, I never understand this, I'm always baffled [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=854.8199999999999s)]
*  by it, how do people get themselves to so vehemently embrace a principle when it lets [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=859.8599999999999s)]
*  them kind of rail against the other side of the political spectrum and then turn around [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=865.1s)]
*  instantly and vehemently support the exact same thing they were denouncing just yesterday [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=870.38s)]
*  because now it's red state governors doing it in the name of some culture war issue. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=875.74s)]
*  How do you explain that? [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=880.6999999999999s)]
*  The shift here is interesting, and I think it plays, there's some role with the way that [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=884.5799999999999s)]
*  the right has become much more populist and much less libertarian over the past 20 years [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=891.1s)]
*  or so. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=896.3000000000001s)]
*  Language about something like personal responsibility you don't see used very often. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=897.78s)]
*  And so the push against the nanny state trying to take away your big gulps or whatever was [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=901.94s)]
*  basically the idea that the government shouldn't be telling people what to eat, even if what [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=906.78s)]
*  they're eating is bad for them. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=911.4200000000001s)]
*  And I think the shift, a lot of it I think is the language of big pharmas trying to poison [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=913.0400000000001s)]
*  you or like big food companies are trying to poison you. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=918.58s)]
*  It's sort of this economically, it's almost socialist where like Marxist, the idea of [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=921.22s)]
*  like the big evil capitalist company is trying to take advantage of you that I see showing [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=926.58s)]
*  up a lot more in right-wing rhetoric. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=932.44s)]
*  And so I think that might be a part of it is that they're able to sort of demonize basically [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=937.2s)]
*  food companies and say like, you know, actually the government is the one that's going to [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=942.6600000000001s)]
*  come in and protect you because, you know, the reason why you're unhealthy is because [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=946.98s)]
*  this company is trying to poison you rather than, you know, sort of in the past it's like, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=952.02s)]
*  okay, who cares whether people are unhealthy, let them make their own choices. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=957.02s)]
*  And the bizarre thing is I'm not even sure, I suppose there's been a little bit of negative [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=961.94s)]
*  polarization on this where you see Democrats sort of defending like, you know, no, we shouldn't [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=966.14s)]
*  be banning, you know, whatever food additives or whatever. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=970.9s)]
*  But I'm not seeing a really loud opposition to it in the way that there was from Republicans [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=974.92s)]
*  during the nanny state era. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=979.88s)]
*  And it's one of the ways I guess for my small libertarian heart to see sort of both the [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=983.52s)]
*  right and the left like agree to be bad about something, like to sort of agree to both kind [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=988.8399999999999s)]
*  of pick the status position is, it makes me sad. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=996.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's sort of like the Democrats have become the loudest and most vocal supporters [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=999.04s)]
*  of the CIA and the NSA and the FBI and the Pentagon, something that obviously, you know, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=1002.78s)]
*  10 years ago would have gotten you kicked out of any, not even left wing circle, but [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=1008.3s)]
*  just like center left circle. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=1012.74s)]
*  And yet that's now the new religion along with their helping establishment as well. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=1014.78s)]
*  Let's talk about RFK for a second in this, you know, very popular Make America Healthy [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=1018.9s)]
*  movement that he helped inspire or led the way for. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=1023.74s)]
*  One of the things, and there are things in this movement, independent of what should [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=1029.86s)]
*  be done about it, I think it is important to bring to people's attention the control [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=1033.1599999999999s)]
*  and the kind of commandeered regulatory process that's captive to the large corporate interests [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=1038.1999999999998s)]
*  are supposed to be regulating. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=1044.78s)]
*  And of course here, the large massive capitalist entity is not this incipient lab grown meat [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=1047.5s)]
*  industry, but instead it's the factory farm industry. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=1054.1799999999998s)]
*  You know, one of the things he's saying is that there's so many foods that are making [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=1058.8s)]
*  Americans morbidly obese and chronically sick. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=1062.48s)]
*  And you know, he talks a lot about how a lot of foods, like there was one interesting thing [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=1066.96s)]
*  that I remember him saying where he talked about like Doritos. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=1070.6s)]
*  Actually there's a New York Times article I think on the Maha movement about how scientists [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=1074.2s)]
*  who make Doritos and other kinds of food like that purposely choose food dyes that make [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=1078.4399999999998s)]
*  the color, they do studies on what color people want to eat most, but also they purposely [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=1084.36s)]
*  use chemicals that make the product addictive, that aren't necessary to produce the products. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=1089.4799999999998s)]
*  They're making them deliberately addictive, kind of like the way social media companies [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=1094.36s)]
*  have often engineered sites to keep people watching. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=1098.12s)]
*  This is an RFK view, I think it's been reported as well. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=1103.28s)]
*  I think if you were going to make an argument that you want to ban food that's toxic or [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=1109.1999999999998s)]
*  unhealthy, you would begin with these industries that just make massive amounts of money selling [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=1114.08s)]
*  cupcakes and brownies and junk food that has almost no nutritional value and all sorts [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=1119.6399999999999s)]
*  of toxins in it. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=1124.52s)]
*  Now again, I don't at all want any of this banned. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=1126.24s)]
*  I think it's all should be available and let people decide. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=1128.96s)]
*  But I guess I'm asking like how could anybody on the one hand support banning lab grown [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=1132.72s)]
*  meat and on the other not support banning all these foods that RFK Jr. himself has been [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=1137.52s)]
*  saying make people so sick? [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=1142.56s)]
*  Yeah, it's because the lab grown meat lobby isn't trying to lie in their pockets. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=1144.8799999999999s)]
*  That I think is essentially it. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=1153.32s)]
*  Animal agriculture is an incredibly powerful industry that gets so much basically government [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=1154.96s)]
*  welfare. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=1159.96s)]
*  They get so much money in subsidies from the government. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=1160.96s)]
*  The whole reason why government cheese as a concept exists is because American dairy [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=1164.8s)]
*  farmers couldn't sell all of the milk that they were producing. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=1171.0s)]
*  And so especially when you have, I mean, getting to dairy alternatives is a whole other issue. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=1174.56s)]
*  But you know, the American farmers get so much money from the government. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=1179.6000000000001s)]
*  And so they're so intertwined into the government that there are all of these like special interests [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=1184.48s)]
*  and bad incentives and corruption that basically incentivize a lot of states to have very large [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=1190.44s)]
*  agriculture sectors like Florida, for example, to do anything possible to protect them or [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=1196.32s)]
*  even just signal, hey, I'm the guy that you want in office because I'm going to protect [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=1201.1200000000001s)]
*  you from this teeny tiny company that, you know, isn't posing any threat to your bottom [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=1205.64s)]
*  line at this point. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=1211.48s)]
*  But maybe one day will 20 years down the road. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14je7qpCAw&t=1212.48s)]
