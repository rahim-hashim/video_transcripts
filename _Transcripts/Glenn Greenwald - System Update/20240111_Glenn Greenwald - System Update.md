# The Revealing Kimmel-Rodgers-McAfee Clash
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [January 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs)
*  There's two really interesting controversies of the last week that I think vividly illustrate [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=0.0s)]
*  a lot of these dynamics. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=15.08s)]
*  So as I said at the top of the show, Pat McAfee is a former NFL player who had a great deal [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=16.36s)]
*  of success attracting a huge and young audience through his YouTube program and his other [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=22.72s)]
*  independent media programs that cover the NFL and cover sports. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=29.64s)]
*  And as a result, ESPN decided that was the kind of audience they were bleeding. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=34.8s)]
*  ESPN can't attract that audience anymore just by being ESPN. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=41.08s)]
*  One of the really interesting dynamics is that people are becoming less and less faithful [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=46.620000000000005s)]
*  toward and trustworthy in corporate media brands and instead are placing their faith [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=53.040000000000006s)]
*  in specific individuals including many times, in fact I would say most times, people who [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=59.059999999999995s)]
*  work outside of the corporate media. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=64.62s)]
*  Obviously Joe Rogan is the best example of that, but there's so many others. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=66.25999999999999s)]
*  That's the growth of independent media. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=70.62s)]
*  To me that's what it means. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=71.98s)]
*  And Pat McAfee in the sports world was one major example. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=74.42s)]
*  That's why ESPN threw $85 million at him over I think five years in order to get him to [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=77.06s)]
*  go to ESPN. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=82.94s)]
*  Obviously Pat McAfee's view was, look, I'm making a ton of money independently. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=83.94s)]
*  I can say whatever I want. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=90.34s)]
*  So if I'm going to go to ESPN, I'm going to continue to say whatever I want and not be [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=91.66s)]
*  told by corporate bosses at ESPN and Disney, which owns ESPN, what I can and can't say. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=96.86s)]
*  Part of the show is that he has on once a week the Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=102.86s)]
*  who has become a very controversial figure during COVID because he was somebody who was [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=109.74s)]
*  very critical of the vaccine. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=115.62s)]
*  He was skeptical of the vaccine. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=117.2s)]
*  He was unvaccinated. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=118.7s)]
*  He's been very critical of Dr. Fauci and he's basically become somebody who has become infatuated [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=120.66s)]
*  with independent media. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=127.53999999999999s)]
*  I was at an event where I was speaking maybe six months ago or a year ago in Miami. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=128.54s)]
*  He was there. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=134.66s)]
*  He called me over and told me he watches my show and he's obviously feeding on independent [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=135.74s)]
*  media and you can see that in a lot of the things he's saying. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=142.94s)]
*  And so he's gone on Pat McAfee's show, made very controversial comments in the past on [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=146.98s)]
*  ESPN now, not just on Pat McAfee's independent media show. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=150.66s)]
*  And one of the things he recently did was imply jokingly that Jimmy Kimmel was eager [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=155.54s)]
*  for the Epstein client list not to come out because when Aaron Rodgers originally called [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=163.56s)]
*  for the Epstein client list to come out, Jimmy Kimmel, the ultimate voice of the liberal [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=170.35999999999999s)]
*  establishment went on his show on ABC and mocked Aaron Rodgers for that. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=176.95999999999998s)]
*  And that's what Aaron Rodgers was talking about. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=183.12s)]
*  So Aaron Rodgers went on Pat McAfee's show on ESPN and made these kinds of comments about [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=185.54s)]
*  Jimmy Kimmel who works for the same company, ABC is the parent company also owned by Disney, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=190.8s)]
*  they're both Disney properties, ABC and ESPN. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=196.16000000000003s)]
*  And here's what Aaron Rodgers said on that program. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=200.70000000000002s)]
*  Bring it up, bring it up Foxy or somebody back there. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=204.36s)]
*  Zits on it. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=206.56s)]
*  We have Super Bowl 58, the emblem put on the screen. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=207.56s)]
*  And then bring up 57 and 56. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=211.0s)]
*  This has something to do with the Epstein list that came out? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=213.0s)]
*  Feels like it. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=215.4s)]
*  That's supposed to be coming out soon. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=216.4s)]
*  That's supposed to be coming out soon. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=217.4s)]
*  I've been waiting in my wine cellar for this. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=219.0s)]
*  A lot of people including Jimmy Kimmel are really hoping that doesn't happen. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=225.32s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=231.20000000000002s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=232.20000000000002s)]
*  Obviously a clip from this particular program was run on Jimmy Kimmel's show. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=233.20000000000002s)]
*  Whenever Aaron brought up the list and then Jimmy mocked him for it. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=237.76s)]
*  Aaron has not forgotten about that. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=242.20000000000002s)]
*  But here we are sitting right in front of that nice bottle of scotch. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=243.8s)]
*  What do you say? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=247.28s)]
*  I'm waiting to celebrate something. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=248.28s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=249.28s)]
*  He's been waiting. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=250.28s)]
*  That's the one. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=251.28s)]
*  I'll tell you what. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=252.28s)]
*  If that list comes out, I definitely will be popping some sort of bottle. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=253.28s)]
*  Hey, you've been calling for it for a few years now. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=257.88s)]
*  Anyone else notice this? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=260.36s)]
*  Oh. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=261.88s)]
*  Now, clearly he was referencing jokingly the fact that Jimmy Kimmel mocked Aaron Rodgers [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=262.88s)]
*  previously for calling for the release. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=269.16s)]
*  He didn't say Jimmy Kimmel was on the client list. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=271.6s)]
*  He just mocked the fact that Jimmy Kimmel being the establishment hack that he is the [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=273.8s)]
*  ultimate establishment hack, thinks it's some sort of conspiracy theory. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=278.28000000000003s)]
*  He doesn't seem to want this list to come out. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=282.8s)]
*  And I don't know if you noticed, but as they broadcast this the entire time, there was [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=286.0s)]
*  this message underneath the program saying, warning this program is a collection of stooges [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=291.24s)]
*  happening in the sports world. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=300.68s)]
*  This doesn't represent ESPN or its bosses that were obviously being cautious. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=303.8s)]
*  As a result of all of this, what basically happened was that ESPN and executive at ESPN [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=308.48s)]
*  started leaking that the ratings for Pat McAfee's show wasn't very good. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=313.88s)]
*  Pat McAfee then came out and said that he knows who the executive at ESPN is who's trying [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=320.24s)]
*  to sabotage his show. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=324.52s)]
*  He called him a rat. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=326.12s)]
*  And this is the kind of thing that in the past would have immediately gotten someone [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=328.92s)]
*  fired from ESPN. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=331.84000000000003s)]
*  The attitude of ESPN always was the real power is the ESPN brand. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=333.08000000000004s)]
*  People who work for us are dispensable. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=339.32s)]
*  They only matter because they work for ESPN. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=341.76s)]
*  And obviously Pat McAfee does not think that for good reason. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=345.44s)]
*  He built up this gigantic audience on his own without ESPN, an audience that ESPN wanted. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=347.94s)]
*  So he's essentially saying, I'm not here to abide by the rules of ESPN. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=353.84s)]
*  I'm going to criticize ESPN when I feel like it because I know that I have all the leverage [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=359.67999999999995s)]
*  in the world because even if they let me go, I have a very successful platform to return [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=363.2s)]
*  to and ESPN needs me more than I need ESPN. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=367.56s)]
*  Now this was something that ended up being discussed on CNN. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=372.08s)]
*  They brought in their media critic Oliver Darcy who as I pointed out before seems to [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=377.71999999999997s)]
*  have no purpose in life other than to demand that social media platforms and corporations [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=381.28s)]
*  crack down on any kind of dissent from liberal orthodoxy, silence and fire the people who [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=388.32s)]
*  are expressing views that CNN dislikes and the liberal establishment dislikes. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=395.59999999999997s)]
*  And so here was CNN trying to shame Disney into either firing Pat McAfee or not allowing [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=401.05999999999995s)]
*  Aaron Rodgers on the air anymore. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=407.0s)]
*  Your media reporter Oliver Darcy. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=409.56s)]
*  Oliver Kimmel says that he would accept an apology from Rodgers. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=411.36s)]
*  He just spoke the quarterback on ESPN. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=415.08000000000004s)]
*  No apology? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=418.76s)]
*  What did he say? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=419.76s)]
*  No apology, Boris. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=421.24s)]
*  No surprise there either. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=422.88s)]
*  Kimmel said he wasn't anticipating one. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=424.04s)]
*  Look, Rodgers said that he understood why Kimmel would be mad if he made the accusation but [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=426.92s)]
*  insisted he did not make this accusation. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=432.48s)]
*  He certainly did signal or suggest that Kimmel might be on the supposed, you know, involved [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=435.86s)]
*  in the Epstein documents that were released over the last several days. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=441.54s)]
*  He was not. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=444.7s)]
*  What Rodgers did do is he used his time to go on this anti-vaccine rant assailing Jimmy [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=446.12s)]
*  Kimmel for apparently standing with the medical community and the likes of Dr. Fauci during [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=455.14s)]
*  the pandemic. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=460.42s)]
*  Why don't we take a look at that? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=461.42s)]
*  He gave a platform to one of the biggest spreaders of misinformation during the COVID times, Dr. Fauci. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=465.21999999999997s)]
*  So in my opinion, you know, he ripped me about the Vax and that turns out to be an L on many [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=473.5s)]
*  occasions because the Vax was not safe and effective like we were told that it was in [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=481.34s)]
*  the beginning. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=485.46s)]
*  There are a lot of injuries now that we've seen related to the vaccine. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=486.74s)]
*  So in my opinion, you went after me. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=490.4s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=492.3s)]
*  You're a comedian. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=493.3s)]
*  I'm not offended, but that was an L. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=494.46000000000004s)]
*  Of course, what Rodgers is saying there is just not true. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=497.46000000000004s)]
*  The medical community would of course say that the vaccine was both safe and effective. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=501.94s)]
*  And at some point, you have to do you see the premise embedded in all of this? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=507.14s)]
*  That whatever the establishment says is the gospel. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=511.90000000000003s)]
*  And because the establishment says it, because Dr. Fauci said it, that means it is true. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=516.66s)]
*  But anything that deviates from that or questions it is false. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=521.98s)]
*  It is, you know, I've talked before about how underappreciated it is, how twisted the [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=525.5s)]
*  situation in the United States is that the leading proponents of censorship are employees [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=534.22s)]
*  of corporate media outlets who call themselves journalists because journalists traditionally [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=540.16s)]
*  have defended very robust protections for free speech and free press and have never [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=543.38s)]
*  advocated for censorship the way little tattletale journalists like Oliver Darcy and people like [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=547.82s)]
*  Kim Do, people who never break stories, they just kind of line this way. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=553.0200000000001s)]
*  They're like tattletales. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=557.1800000000001s)]
*  But it's even more remarkable that journalism, which is supposed to be adversarial to establishment [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=559.9200000000001s)]
*  power, has, at least in the corporate world, become the ultimate defenders of establishment [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=565.96s)]
*  power. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=571.82s)]
*  I genuinely believe, even though they're supposed to be skeptical of establishment pronouncements, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=572.82s)]
*  that establishment pronouncements by definition represent the gospel truth. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=580.0200000000001s)]
*  And that not only does anyone who deviate from establishment pronouncements automatically [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=584.6600000000001s)]
*  is guilty of disinformation, it should not even be permitted. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=589.62s)]
*  How can anybody who goes into journalism who calls themselves a journalist have this mentality [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=594.1600000000001s)]
*  and yet this is the prevailing mentality in corporate media. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=599.72s)]
*  And now here's the coup de grace when he starts to demand that Disney put a stop to this and [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=604.52s)]
*  no longer permit it. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=608.88s)]
*  I have to wonder when ESPN and its parent company, Disney, when they step in here, you [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=609.88s)]
*  know, Disney is at this point one of the only major media companies outside, maybe Fox News, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=614.98s)]
*  that would allow this sort of dangerous anti-vaccine medical misinformation to be aired unchecked [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=620.68s)]
*  on their air. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=627.52s)]
*  This isn't the first time Rogers has done this. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=628.88s)]
*  You know, he goes on these extended rants during his weekly appearance on the Pat McAfee [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=630.64s)]
*  show which is aired on ESPN. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=634.76s)]
*  But for now, ESPN and Disney, they're staying silent and not commenting. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=636.92s)]
*  That's the grievance. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=642.4799999999999s)]
*  Disney has not intervened and told Pat McAfee that he can no longer permit opinions like [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=643.8399999999999s)]
*  this to be aired. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=649.92s)]
*  This is what the corporate media does. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=652.12s)]
*  This is what they're designed to do, to enforce establishment orthodoxies, to try and censor [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=653.68s)]
*  any attempts to question it. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=659.1999999999999s)]
*  The exact opposite of what journalism is supposed to be about. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=660.64s)]
*  Now even the New York Times today took notice of what I do think is a very important reality [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=665.64s)]
*  here in their headline, Pat McAfee's on-air slams of ESPN executives show a network power [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=672.88s)]
*  shift. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=680.04s)]
*  For decades, the biggest star at ESPN was ESPN. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=682.08s)]
*  That's changing as it transitions from cable dominance to a much less certain streaming [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=685.96s)]
*  future. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=690.5200000000001s)]
*  And it goes on to describe how basically Pat McAfee has an audience that neither ESPN or [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=691.5200000000001s)]
*  obviously CNN has anywhere close to having. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=698.48s)]
*  And this has changed the power dynamics where the individuals that the public trusts are [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=703.24s)]
*  actually the people who the audience places their faith in, no longer the corporate brand. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=709.92s)]
*  And that is a major, indicial progress in my view, that these corporate brands have [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=715.68s)]
*  lost the trust and faith of the public to the point where they need to rely on people [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=723.52s)]
*  who the public has decided are actually trustworthy. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDqsMC37fs&t=729.6s)]
