# Media Loses Control As Black/Hispanic Voters Flee Biden | SYSTEM UPDATE
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [November 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM)
*  There has been polling data that is causing a great deal of anxiety among [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=0.0s)]
*  Democratic party stalwarts and in the Biden White House. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=11.42s)]
*  And for a very good reason, for those of you who didn't see it, here is one of [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=15.32s)]
*  the latest polls that is from the New York Times that the headline tells a big [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=19.32s)]
*  part of the story. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=25.240000000000002s)]
*  There you see it. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=26.36s)]
*  Trump leads in five critical states as voters blast Biden, time sienna poll [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=27.0s)]
*  fines. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=33.3s)]
*  Voters in battleground states said they trusted Donald J. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=34.28s)]
*  Trump over President Biden on the economy, foreign policy and immigration. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=37.08s)]
*  As Mr. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=41.96s)]
*  Biden's multiracial base shows signs of fraying. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  Here are the six swing states, all of which Biden was declared the winner of [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=46.64s)]
*  in 2020. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=51.88s)]
*  And here you see Trump with a significant lead. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=53.6s)]
*  He has a 10 point lead or a nine point, but actually it's a 11 point lead in [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=57.480000000000004s)]
*  Nevada, a six point lead in Georgia, a five point lead in Arizona, a four point [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=63.400000000000006s)]
*  lead in Pennsylvania, and a five point lead in Michigan. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=70.48s)]
*  All states that Biden was declared the winner of in 2020. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=75.4s)]
*  Only in Wisconsin is Biden leading and he's leading there only by two points. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=78.08s)]
*  But what is even more disconcerting for Democrats and confusing to the media is [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=86.72s)]
*  the reason why that's happening. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=92.36s)]
*  Quote, across the six battlegrounds, all of which Mr. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=93.8s)]
*  Biden carried in 2020, the president trails by an average of 48 to 44% [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=96.44s)]
*  discontent, whole states through the poll with the majority of voters saying Mr. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=101.44s)]
*  Biden's policies have personally hurt them. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=105.76s)]
*  The survey also reveals the extent to which the multiracial and [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=108.4s)]
*  multigenerational coalition that elected Mr. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=111.84s)]
*  Biden is fraying. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=115.84s)]
*  Demographic groups that backed Mr. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=117.68s)]
*  Biden by landslide margins in 2020 are now far more closely contested as two [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=119.68s)]
*  thirds of the electorate sees the country moving in the wrong direction. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=125.76s)]
*  Voters under 30 favor Mr. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=129.44s)]
*  Biden by only a single percentage point. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=131.28s)]
*  His lead among Hispanic voters is down to single digits and his advantage in [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=134.32s)]
*  urban areas is half of Mr. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=138.2s)]
*  Trump's edge in rural regions. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=140.76s)]
*  Black voters long a bulwark for Democrats and for Mr. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=142.92s)]
*  Biden are now registering 22% support in these states for Mr. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=146.76s)]
*  Trump, a level unseen in presidential politics for a Republican in modern times. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=150.72s)]
*  22% of black voters, one out of every five, saying they would vote for Trump [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=156.2s)]
*  over Biden in these states. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=161.32s)]
*  Add it all together and Mr. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=163.6s)]
*  Trump leads by 10 points in Nevada. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=164.72s)]
*  We just went through those numbers. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=166.52s)]
*  And then here you have an article today specifically about the fact that black [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=169.52s)]
*  and Latino voters are abandoning Trump. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=178.76s)]
*  As black voters drift to Trump, Biden's allies say they have work to do. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=182.12s)]
*  And there's an article about how these demographic groups on which the [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=187.04s)]
*  Democratic Party has long relied to win elections simply don't trust Democrats [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=190.64s)]
*  and don't like Joe Biden. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=195.0s)]
*  Now, I think there's a couple of notes here to observe. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=199.55999999999997s)]
*  One is that it is remarkable that Donald Trump even has a chance to win, let [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=203.07999999999998s)]
*  alone is leading in the key states by this margin, given that he is now [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=210.79999999999998s)]
*  indicted on felony charges in four different jurisdictions, two federal, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=215.44s)]
*  two state. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=219.08s)]
*  10 years ago, it would be unthinkable for a American politician to even have [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=221.64000000000001s)]
*  the possibility of an indictment to get near high office. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=228.08s)]
*  And yet now Trump is indicted in four different jurisdictions on four [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=231.84s)]
*  different felony charges. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=236.64000000000001s)]
*  And voters don't care. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=239.84s)]
*  In fact, his lead has increased since he's been indicted. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=241.92000000000002s)]
*  And I think the only conclusion you can reach is that voters regard our leading [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=244.88s)]
*  institutions of law enforcement and the justice department and the corporate [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=248.67999999999998s)]
*  media that constantly pushes the narrative that Trump is guilty. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=252.39999999999998s)]
*  They regard those institutions as fundamentally corrupt. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=255.76s)]
*  They don't trust them any longer. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=258.12s)]
*  They don't listen. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=259.28s)]
*  These media outlets have been telling people that Trump is corrupt, that he's [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=262.71999999999997s)]
*  a criminal, that he did an insurrection, and they don't care. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=265.92s)]
*  They're not listening to that. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=270.4s)]
*  They don't trust these institutions. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=271.64s)]
*  The media can't affect what they think any longer. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=272.96000000000004s)]
*  And then the second thing to note is that think how often over the last eight [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=277.12s)]
*  years or seven years since Trump descended down that elevator and gave [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=281.72s)]
*  that first speech about immigration. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=285.24s)]
*  How often media outlets have said that Donald Trump is a white nationalist, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=288.8s)]
*  that he's a racist, that he hates black people. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=292.28000000000003s)]
*  He wants to put Latinos into cages. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=295.52s)]
*  He wants to put minority groups into concentration camps. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=297.28000000000003s)]
*  That he's a fascist. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=301.6s)]
*  Then he wants to install white nationalist dictatorship. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=303.16s)]
*  And here you have a huge number of Latino and black voters. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=308.0s)]
*  42% of Latinos, 22% of black voters saying they intend to vote for the person. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=311.96s)]
*  These media outlets have repeatedly told them as a white nationalist and hates [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=317.08s)]
*  them because he's racist. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=320.6s)]
*  Think how much contempt they have to have for these media corporations, how [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=324.36s)]
*  little trust they have to have in them for them, how much respect they have [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=327.28s)]
*  to tune that out and reject that and decide they're going to vote for the [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=331.59999999999997s)]
*  Republican candidate over the Democratic party candidate given the history of [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=335.0s)]
*  voting patterns of these groups. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=338.2s)]
*  And these institutions, the just department, the law enforcement agencies [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=342.12s)]
*  and the FBI, prosecutors and the corporate media have earned that [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=347.03999999999996s)]
*  distrust, they've earned that hatred. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=352.12s)]
*  They deserve that. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=354.2s)]
*  And they're starting to realize just how much of a gap there is. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=355.76s)]
*  Imagine they go into work, they talk to each other every day about how [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=360.16s)]
*  Donald Trump is such a laughable, ridiculous, preposterous, corrupt, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=363.96000000000004s)]
*  fascist, and then they read the New York Times and they see what the American [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=367.32s)]
*  people are thinking and they have to come to the recognition that what [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=371.56s)]
*  they say doesn't matter. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=376.84000000000003s)]
*  Now they'll blame Americans for being stupid, for being low information, for [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=378.12s)]
*  being so susceptible to people who are feeding them disinformation. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=383.8s)]
*  They'll blame the voters themselves that they always do. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=387.0s)]
*  But deep down, they have to know that they are losing control over the [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=390.84s)]
*  narrative. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=394.68s)]
*  That's why they have turned more and more to censorship because they're [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=395.4s)]
*  trying to silence and eliminate the only voices that are dissident, that [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=399.32s)]
*  critique them, that offer an alternative way of thinking. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=404.2s)]
*  And the reason is because of this. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=408.2s)]
*  They saw it in 2016 that if they allow too much free speech on the internet, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=409.64s)]
*  they cannot control the outcome. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=414.2s)]
*  And they're seeing that again now that no matter how much they crack down, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=415.8s)]
*  they're held in such contempt and distrust that if anything, they produce [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=420.76s)]
*  the opposite of the outcome they're trying to engender. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=425.88s)]
*  And no matter your preference for party or for candidate, if corporate media and [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=429.96s)]
*  our leading institutions of authority have completely and irrevocably been [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=435.0s)]
*  lost, the faith and trust of most Americans, given what they are, that is [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=438.6s)]
*  something that ought to be celebrated. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAtKeeY2TM&t=444.36s)]
