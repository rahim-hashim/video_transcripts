# The Left's 180 on Tariffs?
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [April 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8)
*  All right. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=0.0s)]
*  Next question, we'll make it the last one. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=8.22s)]
*  Brian R. Duffy, who says, I don't get the feeling Glenn is very interested in discussing [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=9.76s)]
*  the tariff situation. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=14.88s)]
*  I don't know if he thinks it's really not a subject he has a lot to offer on or what, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=15.88s)]
*  but I'm curious if there is anyone out there who thinks the tariffs can actually accomplish [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=20.0s)]
*  the stated goal of improving our manufacturing industry. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=24.28s)]
*  I understand it's a leverage tool for negotiations as well. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=26.76s)]
*  Most of the coverage I have seen is pessimistic about the chances of it working. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=29.98s)]
*  Is there a guess that Glenn could have on that we could trust to shed some light on [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=33.14s)]
*  this subject? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=36.82s)]
*  Now, obviously, this is something we've been thinking about and have been discussing because [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=37.82s)]
*  the tariff policies that President Trump unveiled are indescribably consequential. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=44.3s)]
*  They're causing consequences all throughout the world, not just economically, but geopolitically. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=50.980000000000004s)]
*  They're affecting every country in transformative ways. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=59.06s)]
*  And one of the things I hope you listened to when I asked Professor Mearsheimer about [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=62.7s)]
*  tariffs, I specifically said, look, I'm not really asking you to describe what you think [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=70.14s)]
*  the economic outcome will be. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=75.86s)]
*  Will it bring back manufacturing base? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=77.34s)]
*  Is it just a negotiating ploy? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=79.98s)]
*  Will it drive up inflation or unemployment? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=81.38s)]
*  Is it a tax? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=86.02000000000001s)]
*  And the reason I didn't ask him that is because I know that he's not an economist. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=88.42s)]
*  He didn't study economics. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=91.17999999999999s)]
*  He's not an expert on tariffs or economic policy. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=92.9s)]
*  And so I just wanted to give him that out, to say, look, I'm not asking you to comment [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=98.42s)]
*  on the tariffs themselves, just how they affect the relationship between US and China. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=101.1s)]
*  And I expected and I really appreciated the fact that he said, look, I can't talk about [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=105.98s)]
*  the economics of tariffs because I'm not an expert in this. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=112.22s)]
*  I really don't know. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=115.3s)]
*  And so one of the things that I've always tried hard to do since the beginning of my [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=117.5s)]
*  journalism career, since I had that blog back in 2005 and 2006, even when I was writing [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=121.84s)]
*  every day, you can go back and see, I don't write about topics where I don't feel like [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=126.7s)]
*  I have any specialized knowledge or expertise or particularly valuable insight. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=130.94s)]
*  I just don't, I'm also, I don't know much about economic theory. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=139.9s)]
*  I don't, I cannot, I don't have the credibility or the competence in my view to sit here and [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=143.46s)]
*  opine on what the outcome of tariffs would be. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=149.1s)]
*  I could if I wanted to. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=152.86s)]
*  I've been reading all the things that you've been reading. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=153.94s)]
*  I've been listening to all the people debate tariffs, not just now, but back in the first [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=156.10000000000002s)]
*  Trump administration. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=161.5s)]
*  That was something he was advocating back then and did to some extent nowhere near the [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=162.5s)]
*  extent to now. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=165.26000000000002s)]
*  But I really talk about economic policy because I feel like I have a decent understanding [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=167.46s)]
*  of it, the kind of understanding that you get if you read and listen to the news or [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=172.17999999999998s)]
*  to experts. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=176.54s)]
*  I talk to people whose views I respect on this issue, but I would be a fraud, I feel [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=177.54s)]
*  like, if I sat here and said, okay, I'm going to explain to you now the implications economically [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=181.73999999999998s)]
*  of tariffs because I don't know. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=185.1s)]
*  I don't know and I just don't want to talk about it. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=187.38s)]
*  Now the one thing I do know about that I think is interesting and that I can talk about is [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=190.66s)]
*  the political evolution of this issue by which I mean specifically that for as long [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=194.18s)]
*  as I've been watching the American left, they have hated free trade, hated it. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=202.62s)]
*  One of the biggest criticisms on the left of Bill and Hillary Clinton and one of the [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=210.74s)]
*  things that people hate about the Clintons is NAFTA and those other free trade agreements [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=214.38s)]
*  that ended up, I think in the view of a lot of people, certainly a lot of people on the [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=219.9s)]
*  left, hauling out the manufacturing base, deindustrializing the middle of the country, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=223.66000000000003s)]
*  causing massive unemployment in the shuttering of factories, the downward mobility of the [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=228.66000000000003s)]
*  middle class and the shipping of jobs overseas. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=235.26000000000002s)]
*  I remember watching the 1992 presidential debate where Ross Perot said, do you hear [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=238.86s)]
*  that sucking sound? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=244.46s)]
*  That's the sound of jobs being sucked out of the United States immediately heading to [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=246.26s)]
*  Mexico and he proved to be totally prescient on this. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=250.54s)]
*  There's a really interesting video that we'll put in the show notes next week. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=254.9s)]
*  I actually promoted it on X when I saw it earlier and watched it. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=259.54s)]
*  When Pat Buchanan wrote his 2011 book, I think it's called The Death of a Superpower, he [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=264.58s)]
*  went on a C-Span show that was hosted by Ralph Nader. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=270.34000000000003s)]
*  So you had Ralph Nader well on the left, in fact so on the left that he ran to the Democratic [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=273.62s)]
*  Party's left in 2000. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=280.22s)]
*  A lot of people think he cost Al Gore the election. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=281.22s)]
*  I don't, but that, so you have Pat Buchanan, you have Ralph Nader on the left here, you [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=283.38s)]
*  have Pat Buchanan obviously on the right, the populist right, and they both completely agreed [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=289.18s)]
*  on the evils of free trade. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=294.06s)]
*  In fact, both of them were at the 1999 very famous notorious protest outside the World [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=296.42s)]
*  Trade Organization in Seattle that turned violent because a lot of kind of Antifa types, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=303.06s)]
*  I mean there was no Antifa in that but same kind of strain, but there were huge numbers [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=307.29999999999995s)]
*  of people there from the left and the right who didn't engage in violence but were there [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=311.38s)]
*  to protest world trade, global trade, free trade. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=315.02s)]
*  And you know, I think the idea that free trade and globalism are evils socially, economically, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=321.65999999999997s)]
*  politically is as close to a consensus on the American left, maybe in the Western left [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=330.82000000000005s)]
*  as I think you can get. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=335.3s)]
*  So I have to say it's a little odd now to watch finally a politician who promised this [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=337.86s)]
*  during the election, it's not like he unveiled this out of nowhere, he promised he was going [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=344.0s)]
*  to do this during the election. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=347.06s)]
*  Most of what Trump's doing is stuff he talked about in the election, not trying to get Greenland [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=349.18s)]
*  or the Panama Canal, not bombing Yemen, but a lot of the most controversial stuff including [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=353.62s)]
*  invoking the LA Anonymous Act to have full discretion to deport not just illegal people [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=360.21999999999997s)]
*  here illegally but also legally all the stuff he talked about in the campaign trail. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=366.58s)]
*  And tariffs was one of them and people voted for them, they got convinced that that would [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=371.58s)]
*  help. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=375.53999999999996s)]
*  So it's very odd for me to see people on the left just, I'm not saying they have to support [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=376.82s)]
*  exactly how Trump is doing the tariffs, they do seem a bit haphazard to me but again I'm [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=382.3s)]
*  not going to opine on that. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=388.42s)]
*  But it seems odd for people on the left to reflexively say, oh my god these tariffs are [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=391.62s)]
*  terrible and to even cite the fact that Wall Street is angry about them, that the stock [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=397.22s)]
*  market is declining because of it as though that's some terrible thing, now the left is [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=401.70000000000005s)]
*  afraid of alienating Wall Street. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=406.22s)]
*  I thought the whole point was that we're tired of policies that only benefit a tiny sliver [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=408.22s)]
*  of the country, this concentrated corporate power that's globalist in nature, Wall Street [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=414.86s)]
*  barons tycoons and the like. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=420.06s)]
*  So because it's Trump now a lot of people are saying, wait a minute we don't want tariffs, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=423.44s)]
*  we want to keep the regime of global trade, of free trade, really? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=426.66s)]
*  That's not what I've ever heard previously. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=430.86s)]
*  And then there are a lot of people I think the smarter more thoughtful people who don't [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=434.18s)]
*  have this reflexive reaction to Trump who are saying, tariffs can actually do important [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=436.82s)]
*  and beneficial things, we need them, we have to start undermining the regime of free trade, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=441.78s)]
*  it's just not this way that he's doing it is not the correct way, which seems to me [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=446.05999999999995s)]
*  to be a middle ground. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=451.21999999999997s)]
*  But it's kind of like immigration where opposition to open borders, when I started writing about [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=452.21999999999997s)]
*  politics was a very left-wing position. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=458.38s)]
*  Bernie Sanders in 2016 when he ran was asked by his recline about open borders and he was [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=460.82s)]
*  horrified Bernie Sanders said, open borders? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=465.05999999999995s)]
*  That's what you favor? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=467.73999999999995s)]
*  That's a Koch brothers proposal. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=468.73999999999995s)]
*  And back then it was George Bush and Dick Cheney and the Chamber of Commerce and John [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=471.42s)]
*  McCain very people who are very corporatists and their interests and orientations who wanted [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=475.58000000000004s)]
*  immigration reform wanted to open up the borders much more because that's beneficial to large [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=481.82s)]
*  American corporations if you flood the labor market with cheap labor, you drive down the [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=486.46000000000004s)]
*  cost of doing business, you increase the bottom line, you got out the unions and the protections [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=490.38s)]
*  that American labor has, it's exactly what happened and that's why the left was opposed [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=498.62s)]
*  to it. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=503.78000000000003s)]
*  Cesar Chavez the Mexican-American union leader hated immigration. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=504.78000000000003s)]
*  There's an article in 2011 by Jamil Bowie in the American Prospect who's now like the [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=510.3s)]
*  supposed left-wing columnist for the New York Times, he's really just a partisan Democrat [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=516.7s)]
*  but he wrote when he was at the American Prospect an article I think it was in 2010 warning [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=520.38s)]
*  Democrats not to be too aggressive about or permissive about immigration because he [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=525.3s)]
*  said the people who will lose their jobs and suffer the most are black and Latino Americans, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=532.9399999999999s)]
*  those are the ones who lose their job first, who will have to compete with undocumented [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=538.3s)]
*  immigrants. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=542.3s)]
*  This was really it was a left-wing view opposing immigration and the establishment Republican [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=544.54s)]
*  Party you had those populists but the establishment Republican Party wanted open borders and so [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=549.9s)]
*  now you just have this complete mix now and it's in a lot of ways the same with tariffs. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=554.54s)]
*  I'm just amazed at how many people are so horrified that Wall Street doesn't like Trump's [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=559.54s)]
*  plan that they're throwing a tantrum that they I guess want to preserve now the system [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=564.02s)]
*  of free trade so again I'm not commenting on because I can't the merits of the tariffs [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=570.42s)]
*  and how they're done I just see that political aspect to it and we might have somebody on [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=577.3399999999999s)]
*  we talked about somebody having somebody on this week the problem is that if I just have [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=584.46s)]
*  an economist on who's like vehemently opposed to or vocally in support of Trump's tariff [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=587.94s)]
*  regime I really won't be able to push back on it the way I need to and they'll just be [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=593.38s)]
*  here to state one opinion I won't really have the chops especially if they're experts in [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=598.14s)]
*  tariffs and trade to be able to push back we talked about maybe having two people on [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=603.6800000000001s)]
*  who have some different views that I can kind of mediate so you can hear the clash of ideas [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=607.7800000000001s)]
*  which I think is probably the best way to do it but it is true that in general I've [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=613.12s)]
*  often not covered very important topics simply if I think I lack the expertise or the competence [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=616.28s)]
*  to do so cannot be an expert in everything I think one of the downfalls in fact of American [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=620.88s)]
*  journalism and American punditry is that people feel compelled to just pontificate on everything [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=626.4s)]
*  including things they know virtually nothing about and that's something I really try and [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=631.12s)]
*  avoid and I was glad that Professor Mearsheimer obviously abstained as well from talking about [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=636.02s)]
*  a topic in which he wasn't an expert either [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utZ1gm9oaF8&t=640.48s)]
