# Republicans Sacrifice American Free Speech and Break Taboo to Shield Israel
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [May 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg)
*  Now, there's so much that's been happening in the Republican Party that is so [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=0.0s)]
*  hypocritical and craven that the stench of it is enough to make you sick and [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=16.0s)]
*  want to vomit. It's nauseating. One of the main Republican themes that they've used [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=21.56s)]
*  to attack liberal and Democratic Party politicians over many years is that you [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=28.28s)]
*  are not allowed to criticize the United States government or United States [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=32.64s)]
*  leaders on dirty foreign soil. You're only allowed to criticize the United [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=36.28s)]
*  States government and the president when you're on sacred American soil, but if [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=41.92s)]
*  you do that on foreign soil, that is unpatriotic or treasonous. And we'll show [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=45.96s)]
*  you many times when the Republicans have turned that into a huge political [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=53.56s)]
*  scandal and insisted on the rule, the taboo, that you cannot go to a foreign [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=56.8s)]
*  country and criticize your own government. In 2003, the country group [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=61.68s)]
*  Dixie Chicks were really canceled. People were burning their records, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=67.24s)]
*  threatening radio stations that played their records because they committed [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=71.92s)]
*  the crime of going to London at a concert and criticizing in a very mild [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=75.24000000000001s)]
*  way George Bush for engaging in the war in Iraq. And they were supposedly [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=79.2s)]
*  treasonous because they criticized the US government and the American president [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=83.8s)]
*  on foreign soil. That is a no-no. Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, who has [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=87.52s)]
*  become a hero to the pro-Israel right, she led the hearings that resulted in the [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=93.56s)]
*  firing of the presidents of Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania for not [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=97.56s)]
*  doing enough to crack down on anti-Israel speech, went to a foreign [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=102.08s)]
*  country, at least a country that's nominally a foreign country for now, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=106.32s)]
*  Israel, and she gave a speech before the Knesset, the Israeli parliament, in which [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=110.36s)]
*  she continuously bashed her own government and its leaders. Listen to [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=115.75999999999999s)]
*  what she said. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=119.64s)]
*  Now, it's ironic and sickening that she invoked George Washington in her trip to [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=130.44s)]
*  to the Israeli government because if you read George Washington's farewell [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=137.96s)]
*  address, which I highly encourage you to do, maybe we'll go over it this week if [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=143.32s)]
*  we have time, it's as important at least as Dwight Eisenhower's farewell address [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=146.36s)]
*  when he warned of the military-industrial complex. What George [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=151.36s)]
*  Washington said was that the most important thing the United States has [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=155.08s)]
*  to do in foreign policy is avoid enduring alliances and enduring enmities. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=158.72s)]
*  We cannot have devotion to other foreign countries and make their wars our wars, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=167.44s)]
*  nor should we declare other countries our enemy eternally and spend decades [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=172.68s)]
*  trying to undermine them or take them down. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=178.72s)]
*  He wanted a policy of only fighting wars when our national security was at stake. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=180.48000000000002s)]
*  And Elise Stefanik and her fellow pro-Israel Republicans and Democrats [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=187.24s)]
*  have exactly the opposite vision. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=193.23999999999998s)]
*  I doubt she even read George Washington's farewell address. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=194.92s)]
*  She's invoking George Washington in the Israeli Knesset to pretend that she's [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=198.12s)]
*  gone on this foreign trip in order to promote her values when she's actually [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=203.0s)]
*  advocating a foreign policy that he most vociferously warned against in that [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=207.92s)]
*  farewell address. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=212.88s)]
*  Let me continue here. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=213.64s)]
*  This means crushing anti-Semitism at home and supplying the state of Israel [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=215.76s)]
*  with what it needs, when it needs it, without conditions to achieve total [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=220.96s)]
*  victory in the face of evil. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=225.96s)]
*  Our obligation as Americans, she said, is to provide Israel with whatever it [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=228.16s)]
*  wants, whatever it asks for, whatever it needs with no conditions. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=233.8s)]
*  If Israel wants something, it's the duty of the American government and its [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=237.92000000000002s)]
*  people to pay for it and give it to Israel. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=240.96s)]
*  This is a person who claims to be part of the America first rebranding of the [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=243.32s)]
*  Republican Party because she's desperate to be Donald Trump's vice president. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=248.76s)]
*  And while she brands herself as America first, she travels to a foreign country [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=253.72s)]
*  and proclaims that it is the duty of the United States government, of which she's [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=258.2s)]
*  elected representative, of its government and its people, to give Israel everything [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=262.68s)]
*  it wants, everything it asks for, everything it needs, everything it [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=268.64s)]
*  desires, without condition, when they ask for it, period. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=271.84s)]
*  While she's standing in front of an Israeli flag. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=275.4s)]
*  Chances of death to America are not hollow slogans. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=279.96s)]
*  They are a promise that what happened here on October 7th could happen in the [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=283.64s)]
*  United States, unless Hamas and its jihadist accomplices are eliminated. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=288.88s)]
*  And it is the idea that Hamas is a threat to the United States is so incredibly [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=295.2s)]
*  stupid that you should be insulted that she has such a low regard for your [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=303.28s)]
*  intelligence that she thinks you're going to believe that. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=308.44s)]
*  Hamas is a tiny little battalion in a tiny little country with extremely [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=312.35999999999996s)]
*  primitive weapons and they have no interest in or desire to attack the [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=319.08s)]
*  United States. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=326.2s)]
*  They've never tried to, they've never claimed they would. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=326.67999999999995s)]
*  Israel has killed far more Americans than Hamas ever has, far more, including [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=328.88s)]
*  this year. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=335.36s)]
*  So she needs to justify why she's so emotionally invested in, so devoted to [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=337.92s)]
*  the goal of supplying Israel everything she wants. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=343.76s)]
*  And so she has to invent this obviously preposterous lie that defeating Hamas [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=346.52s)]
*  is somehow necessary for American national security. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=351.71999999999997s)]
*  United States high honor and high responsibility to support Israel's effort. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=355.88s)]
*  I have been clear at home and I will be clear here. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=361.84000000000003s)]
*  There is no excuse for an American president to block aid to Israel, aid [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=365.12s)]
*  that was duly passed by the Congress. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=370.32000000000005s)]
*  There was no excuse to ease sanctions on Iran, paying a $6 billion ransom to the [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=373.16s)]
*  world's leading state sponsor of terror or to dither and hide while the United [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=378.52000000000004s)]
*  States is fighting for their lives. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=384.0s)]
*  No excuse, full stop. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=387.28s)]
*  That's why I'm proud to have sponsored or backed every man. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=390.2s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=393.35999999999996s)]
*  So she just went through a bunch of policies of Joe Biden, many of which were [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=393.64s)]
*  very dishonestly described and there are very few things that can make me defend [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=399.56s)]
*  the Biden administration. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=403.12s)]
*  But hearing her claim that we paid a $6 billion ransom to Iran as that we handed [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=405.76s)]
*  them cash when in fact what we had done was seized their money that they were due [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=410.52000000000004s)]
*  for having sold their oil on an open market. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=417.0s)]
*  We seized and froze that $6 billion. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=419.04s)]
*  And then Biden announced as part of an attempt to reopen Iran's nuclear facilities [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=423.36s)]
*  that he would unfreeze their money. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=427.72s)]
*  That money is not American money. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=429.44s)]
*  We stole it. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=431.52000000000004s)]
*  We froze it. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=432.28000000000003s)]
*  We seized it. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=432.96000000000004s)]
*  And on top of that, once October 7th happened, Biden knew that he couldn't [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=435.8s)]
*  unfreeze that money and so they never got that money. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=439.88s)]
*  So claiming that Israel or Iran was paid $6 billion by the United States is a lie [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=442.48s)]
*  on every level. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=449.76s)]
*  But the more important thing is that she is clearly standing in front of a foreign [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=450.36s)]
*  government's parliament in front of a foreign flag, a foreign country's flag. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=454.32s)]
*  There's no American flag there, of course, just an Israeli flag. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=457.84s)]
*  And she's attacking her own government, her own president on foreign soil. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=463.0s)]
*  Now, I personally have never cared much about this rule, but the Republican [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=466.8s)]
*  party and the American right care about it a lot. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=472.68s)]
*  They have been insisting that this is one of the most sacred rules there is that [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=476.4s)]
*  if you go to foreign soil and criticize your own government, like Elise Stavanić [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=480.52s)]
*  just did repeatedly, not just on foreign soil, but inside a Israeli government [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=483.96s)]
*  building before an Israeli government body that you are essentially committing [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=488.6s)]
*  treason. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=493.44s)]
*  I could spend all night showing you examples. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=495.72s)]
*  I'm just going to show you a couple to illustrate the point here in 2021. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=497.52000000000004s)]
*  Fox News has this headline. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=500.96000000000004s)]
*  Joe Biden slams Republicans while on foreign soil in a break with political [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=505.04s)]
*  norms. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=510.36s)]
*  Quote, Biden's presidential campaign criticized Trump in 2019 when he spoke out [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=512.52s)]
*  against Biden. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=517.44s)]
*  Let me just. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=519.16s)]
*  This is Fox News and they're saying, just go back a little bit so I can read [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=524.96s)]
*  that. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=530.6s)]
*  They're saying that Joe Biden broke with political norms when his presidential [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=531.96s)]
*  campaign criticized Donald Trump in 2019 when he spoke out against Biden from [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=536.4s)]
*  Japan, Republicans and Democrats have long observed a tradition that quote [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=542.4s)]
*  politics stops at the water's edge. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=547.4399999999999s)]
*  Here from the New York Times in February of 2006, Gore's quote, supreme [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=552.0s)]
*  disloyalty in Saudi Arabia, quote, Al Gore traveled to Saudi Arabia last week. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=558.16s)]
*  And by the way, in 2006, he was not in the American government. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=563.64s)]
*  He was a private citizen. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=566.3599999999999s)]
*  But nonetheless, he traveled to Saudi Arabia and in a speech there on Sunday, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=567.3199999999999s)]
*  he criticized, quote, abuses committed by the U.S. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=571.12s)]
*  government against Arabs after the attacks of September 11th, 2001. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=574.56s)]
*  A burst of flabbergasted conservative blogging followed the Associated Press [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=579.64s)]
*  dispatch about the speech with the most clever remark coming from Mark Stein, who [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=584.4s)]
*  called the former vice president, quote, chic Al Gore. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=588.92s)]
*  The editorial page of Investors Business Daily accused Gore of, quote, supreme [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=592.68s)]
*  disloyalty to his country. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=596.92s)]
*  That wasn't even an elected member of anything. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=600.4399999999999s)]
*  That was a private American citizen who criticized the U.S. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=602.24s)]
*  government, specifically the Bush and the administration while on foreign soil. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=604.64s)]
*  And he was accused of being essentially a traitor to his country because you're [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=609.5600000000001s)]
*  not allowed to criticize your own government while on foreign soil. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=614.12s)]
*  Here from CNN in 2012, a CNN fact check, quote, Obama went on an apology tour, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=618.08s)]
*  Mitt Romney and others say, quote, the president began what I have called an [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=624.04s)]
*  apology tour of going to various nations in the Middle East and criticizing [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=629.16s)]
*  America. Romney also said, quote, the reason I call it an apology tour is [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=632.88s)]
*  because you went to the Middle East and you flew to Egypt and to Saudi Arabia [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=637.36s)]
*  and to Turkey and to Iraq. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=641.0s)]
*  Romney said, quote, in those nations and on Arabic TV, you said that America had [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=643.36s)]
*  been dismissive and derisive. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=647.6s)]
*  You said that on occasion America had dictated to other nations. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=649.9599999999999s)]
*  So there's been for decades this right wing American conservative Republican [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=654.72s)]
*  principle that if you go to foreign soil and criticize your own government, that [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=659.1600000000001s)]
*  it means that you are a traitor. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=664.48s)]
*  But as is true for most of the claimed principles and values and beliefs and [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=668.0400000000001s)]
*  rules of the pro-Israel sector of the Republican Party, they instantly [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=673.5200000000001s)]
*  evaporate the minute the question is Israel, which is why the U.S. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=677.0s)]
*  Congresswoman Stefanic knows that she can go to Israel and bash her own [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=683.2s)]
*  president and the government on foreign soil without anyone calling her any of [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=688.2800000000001s)]
*  these names. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=693.5600000000001s)]
*  Now, speaking of Congresswoman Stefanic, she continues to berate college [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=694.32s)]
*  administrators and demand that they not allow anti-Israel speech to proliferate [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=701.6400000000001s)]
*  on their campus. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=708.5200000000001s)]
*  I never knew before that it was one of the duties of the federal Congress to [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=709.48s)]
*  dictate to American universities and colleges, especially private ones, like [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=714.6400000000001s)]
*  they did with Harvard, like they did with Northwestern here, what kind of speech [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=720.36s)]
*  they can allow on their campus. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=723.5600000000001s)]
*  But she's been the leader in demanding limitations on speech. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=725.9200000000001s)]
*  She was the one who demanded that. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=731.5600000000001s)]
*  The Harvard and University of Pennsylvania presidents say that students are not [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=733.7600000000001s)]
*  allowed to quote advocate genocide. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=737.08s)]
*  And when they tried to say, well, it depends on the context. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=741.12s)]
*  If you write it not bad saying Palestinians should be free from the [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=743.9200000000001s)]
*  River to the Sea, that's free speech. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=747.08s)]
*  But if you harass and stalk a Jewish student with anti-Semitic threats, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=749.6800000000001s)]
*  obviously that isn't, but that was not good enough for her. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=753.88s)]
*  She wanted a blanket condemnation on any anti-Israel speech that was considered to [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=757.44s)]
*  quote incite genocide, which Republicans who are pro-Israel like her consider to [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=763.28s)]
*  be any kind of anti-Israel speech and then got them fired from the controversy [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=767.68s)]
*  she created. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=772.92s)]
*  Of course, she's not going to give up on that. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=773.52s)]
*  She's still holding hearings to berate administrators for our top universities [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=774.8399999999999s)]
*  to impose more and more speech restrictions in the name of protecting [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=781.36s)]
*  this foreign country. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=785.1999999999999s)]
*  Here she is talking to the president of Northwestern University and you'll see [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=786.0s)]
*  who she cites as her authority on the limits of political speech and what it [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=792.52s)]
*  should be in the United States. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=797.4s)]
*  President Schill, the ADL released its report card for universities responses [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=800.8s)]
*  to anti-Semitism. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=805.04s)]
*  Yes, that's right. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=806.28s)]
*  The Republican Party, American conservatives now run around holding reports of the [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=807.12s)]
*  Anti-Defamation League. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=812.52s)]
*  He spent two years saying Tucker Carlson should be fired by Fox, who have been [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=814.96s)]
*  attacking conservative speech for years, who have been explicit activists on [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=819.0799999999999s)]
*  behalf of the Democratic Party. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=824.28s)]
*  But now that it comes to Israel, Elise Stefanik holds up their judgments about [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=825.92s)]
*  what you can and can't say as unquestioned gospel. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=830.16s)]
*  And here's what she said when doing that to the president of Northwestern. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=833.36s)]
*  President Schill, the ADL released its report card for universities responses to [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=837.12s)]
*  anti-Semitism. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=841.48s)]
*  And you're aware that Northwestern was the only university whose grade was [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=842.64s)]
*  downgraded, correct? [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=846.1999999999999s)]
*  Yes, I am aware of that. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=848.2800000000001s)]
*  And isn't it also true that the Northwestern earned an F for your failure to [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=849.6800000000001s)]
*  respond and combat anti-Semitism? [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=853.9200000000001s)]
*  And they called for your resignation. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=855.84s)]
*  Is that correct? [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=857.0400000000001s)]
*  I have great respect for the ADL. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=858.2800000000001s)]
*  Not I'm not asking. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=860.8000000000001s)]
*  Look at what you have to say when you are administrator of a college campus, the [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=861.6s)]
*  place that's supposed to be the pinnacle of free discourse and free thought and [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=868.44s)]
*  free expression. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=872.8000000000001s)]
*  If you get confronted by a group that fanatically defends Israel for having [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=874.64s)]
*  permitted too much, quote, anti-Semitic speech on college campuses, which we know [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=880.52s)]
*  means criticizing Israel, and it demands your termination instead of attacking that [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=884.4799999999999s)]
*  group and condemning its attempt to limit free speech in the United States on [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=889.92s)]
*  behalf of a foreign country, which is what the ADL does, you have to say, I have [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=894.1999999999999s)]
*  the greatest respect for the ADL. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=898.4s)]
*  They are a noble and wonderful organization. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=901.6s)]
*  I'm deeply hurt and saddened that they disapprove of what I'm doing. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=904.6400000000001s)]
*  You have to proclaim your profound admiration for the ADL. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=910.08s)]
*  If you want to have any chance of succeeding in the United States, tell me [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=914.5600000000001s)]
*  which group it is in the United States again. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=919.32s)]
*  That is the weak, vulnerable, singular victim group. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=920.84s)]
*  It's American Jews who are uniquely discriminated against and marginalized [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=926.0s)]
*  and endangered, even though administrators of our top universities in public, the [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=930.8800000000001s)]
*  men at the ADL as mentioned, have to proclaim their fealty for it and their [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=936.2800000000001s)]
*  admiration of it, even as they call for your firing. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=939.6400000000001s)]
*  Listen to the rest of this. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=942.8800000000001s)]
*  I have great respect for the ADL. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=943.84s)]
*  I'm not asking your respect for the ADL. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=945.84s)]
*  I'm asking, is it a fact that you earned an F? [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=947.84s)]
*  There's Elise Stavanić holding up the ADL report with an F on it, as though the ADL [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=951.24s)]
*  is authorized, like teachers, to give out grades to administrators based on what [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=957.24s)]
*  kind of speech they allow on campus. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=962.84s)]
*  And if you allow too much anti-Israel speech on college campuses, speech that [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=964.84s)]
*  Jonathan Greenblatt, the executive director of the ADL, can't do, can't [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=970.44s)]
*  do, can't do, can't do, can't do, can't do, can't do, can't do, can't do, can't [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=974.84s)]
*  do. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=978.84s)]
*  And if you allow the ADL to do it and not the executive director of the ADL [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=979.84s)]
*  considers to be bigoted and anti-Semitic and then you have to be fired, that's [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=983.84s)]
*  now authoritative. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=988.84s)]
*  The ADL wants all kinds of speech limitations on college campuses in [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=990.84s)]
*  defense of black people, in defense of LGBTs, in defense of women, in defense [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=994.84s)]
*  of immigrants, in defense of Muslims. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=999.84s)]
*  Obviously Elise Stavanić would heap scorn on the idea that speech on college [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1002.84s)]
*  But this group of Americans, that's when the ADL suddenly becomes unquestioned authority [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1006.84s)]
*  and what college administrators should allow. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1013.84s)]
*  For the ADL, I am sad that they gave Northwestern an F. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1015.84s)]
*  But it's true. You got an F. Yes. Moving on. Let me tell you why you earned an F. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1021.84s)]
*  I want to discuss what has been referred to as the Deering Meadows Agreement, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1026.8400000000001s)]
*  your unilateral capitulation to the Pro Hamas anti-Israel anti-Semitic encampment. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1030.84s)]
*  But let's talk about what has occurred on this encampment. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1036.84s)]
*  Isn't it true that a Jewish Northwestern student was assaulted? [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1040.84s)]
*  So I want to question the premise of your question. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1045.84s)]
*  No, no, no, no. I'm asking the questions. You're answering. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1049.84s)]
*  My answer is not a capitulation. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1052.84s)]
*  I'm asking the question. You're required to answer. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1055.84s)]
*  Isn't it true that a Jewish Northwestern student was assaulted? [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1058.84s)]
*  There are allegations that a Jewish student was assaulted. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1063.84s)]
*  We are investigating those allegations. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1067.84s)]
*  Now imagine if a Democrat held a hearing and berated a university president [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1071.84s)]
*  for allowing too much speech that was critical of the trans movement [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1078.84s)]
*  and then brought up a single incident where a trans student was assaulted [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1082.84s)]
*  and cited a pro-LGBT group like Human Rights Campaign or any of those, [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1087.84s)]
*  giving you an F because you're allowing too much anti-trans speech on campuses. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1094.84s)]
*  Conservatives would be indignant unanimously. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1100.84s)]
*  Everything gets changed, reversed, shifted, abandoned [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1105.84s)]
*  the minute it comes to this one foreign country and to this one group of people. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1108.84s)]
*  Now that was May 23rd. May 24th, the US Department of State introduced what it calls [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1113.84s)]
*  quote, the Office of the Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1121.84s)]
*  And that special envoy, that office of the special envoy, part of the US government, [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1127.84s)]
*  hosted a symposium on effective action to confront online anti-Semitism. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1132.84s)]
*  If there is one issue that conservatives in the United States have been complaining about [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1138.84s)]
*  more than any other over the last, say, four years, [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1142.84s)]
*  it has been governmental attempts to influence tech platforms, big tech in particular, [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1145.84s)]
*  to limit certain ideas on the grounds that those ideas are anathema to the US government's beliefs and policies. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1151.84s)]
*  It's tyrannical, it's authoritarianism. I've been someone who's been outspoken on that as well. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1158.84s)]
*  Here's the US government, the State Department now doing exactly that, [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1166.84s)]
*  though this time in defense of the one minority group that conservatives accept as a victim group, [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1171.84s)]
*  which is American Jews, and in defense of a foreign country, which is Israel, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1176.84s)]
*  pressuring big tech companies to limit speech in the name of that agenda. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1180.84s)]
*  The statement reads, quote, on May 23rd, US Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1186.84s)]
*  Ambassador Deborah Lipstadt hosted a symposium to combat online anti-Semitism. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1197.84s)]
*  The symposium convened tech executives, NGOs, and government representatives [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1203.84s)]
*  to foster collaborative thinking about effective action against surging online anti-Semitism. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1208.84s)]
*  The forum was an enriching and productive exchange of ideas across the three sectors. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1214.84s)]
*  Participating technology companies included Google, Metta, Microsoft, TikTok, and X. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1220.84s)]
*  Special Envoys for Combating Anti-Semitism in Canada and Israel took part in the symposium, [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1227.84s)]
*  along with the Jeopardy Chief of Mission for Germany. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1232.84s)]
*  Six NGOs from around the world, including the American Jewish Committee, Anti-Defamation League, [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1235.84s)]
*  World Jewish Congress, Center for Countering Digital Hate, Cyberwell, and Decoding Anti-Semitism also participated. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1239.84s)]
*  Participating technology companies volunteered, oh they volunteered, [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1247.84s)]
*  when the US government calls you to a conference and complains about speech that you're using, [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1253.84s)]
*  when the companies, quote, volunteer to consider taking independent action to address anti-Semitism on their respective platforms, [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1259.84s)]
*  including establishing dedicated expert positions on policy teams, implementing anti-Semitism training for key personnel, [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1271.84s)]
*  and increasing transparency by publicly reporting on trends in anti-Semitic content. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1279.84s)]
*  That's exactly the kind of government coercion the American right has been vocally complaining of for years. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1286.84s)]
*  The government summons big tech companies and Jewish advocacy groups and invites them to develop new policies [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1294.84s)]
*  to effectively combat views that the United States government considers to be anti-Semitism online. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1304.84s)]
*  Is that something American conservatives now support? [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1312.84s)]
*  This is already happening. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1317.84s)]
*  TikTok, which is continuing to battle for its right to stay in the United States without having to sell off its primary asset to an American company, [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1318.84s)]
*  announced the following, quote, for you feed eligibility standards. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1327.84s)]
*  And this is what it said, quote, before you feed is a unique TikTok feature that uses a personalized recommendation system [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1334.84s)]
*  to allow you to discover a breadth of content, creators, and topics. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1341.84s)]
*  Certain types of content may be fine if seen occasionally, but problematic if viewed in clusters. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1346.84s)]
*  Throughout our guidelines, you will see eligibility standards for the FYF. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1351.84s)]
*  Here is a consolidated, quick guide of content that is ineligible for the feed. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1355.84s)]
*  Quote, misinformation, conspiracy theories that are unfounded and claim that certain events or situations are carried out by covert or powerful groups, [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1361.84s)]
*  such as the government or a secret society. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1372.84s)]
*  No claiming the government engages in conspiracy theories that has never happened before in American history. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1375.84s)]
*  And to claim it is to mean that it means that you are spreading disinformation and will not be allowed to spread. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1383.84s)]
*  Also, on this list of misinformation are these conspiracy theories that are unfounded. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1390.84s)]
*  That's the misinformation. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1398.84s)]
*  So TikTok on its own already knows that the say in the United States, [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1401.84s)]
*  they need to start limiting the kinds of speech that the US government considers to be offensive. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1404.84s)]
*  And now they're doing that. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1411.84s)]
*  They participated in the meeting at the State Department with every other major platform. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1412.84s)]
*  And it's part of this GOP led, at least Stefanik led, but plenty of support from the Democratic Party to pressure all of our institutions of free speech, [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1417.84s)]
*  including academia and the Internet to restrict speech in the name of supporting Israel. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1425.84s)]
*  Remember all the reporting that we did about the TikTok ban, how it lingered in Washington for four years, couldn't get passed, was considered way too extreme. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1432.84s)]
*  Suddenly, within two months of October 7, Democrats gave the Republicans the majority needed to enact the TikTok ban. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1441.84s)]
*  Why? Why did that suddenly happen? [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1448.84s)]
*  It's not me saying it's the leaders, the sponsors of the TikTok ban and members of all political parties who say the reason they decided they needed to ban TikTok was because there was too much criticism of Israel circulating on that platform, [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1451.84s)]
*  too much video showing what was happening in Gaza. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1464.84s)]
*  And that was what was causing young Americans to oppose Biden's policy of feeding and arming Israel. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1468.84s)]
*  They banned TikTok or required it to be sold principally because there was too much free speech on that platform, particularly critical of Israel. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1475.84s)]
*  That's what they say. That's what they admit. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1484.84s)]
*  And those other events, the Elise Stefanik hearing, the State Department Summit, were all from the last week. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1488.84s)]
*  Every week brings new crackdowns on campus, online, in all of our societal sectors on speech that's critical of Israel at exactly the same time that Israeli massacres escalate. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1496.84s)]
*  And it's one thing to support the Israeli war. It's another thing to support the U.S. financing of it. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzBzQBJowg&t=1508.84s)]
*  But if you're at the point where you're willing to sacrifice the free speech rights of American citizens on American soil to protect this one foreign government, I would suggest that your priorities are to put it very generously misguided and confused.
