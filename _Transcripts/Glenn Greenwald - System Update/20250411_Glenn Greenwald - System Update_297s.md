# Douglas Murray FALLS APART in Debate VS Dave Smith: Glenn Reacts
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [April 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI7Cgsrv9UQ)
*  Last point, just not really a question, but speaking of independent media like Anjo Rogan's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI7Cgsrv9UQ&t=0.0s)]
*  show, today, I don't know if it was recorded today, but it was released today, they had [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI7Cgsrv9UQ&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  kind of a debate between Dave Smith on the one hand, who's a libertarian, anti-interventionist, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI7Cgsrv9UQ&t=20.28s)]
*  anti-war Israel critic, and Douglas Murray, the British, whatever he is, who's fanatically [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI7Cgsrv9UQ&t=26.44s)]
*  in favor of Israel and wars, who loves wars, he thinks they're all great. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI7Cgsrv9UQ&t=34.64s)]
*  There's this phrase I once heard, that I once read, it might be something that a lot of [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI7Cgsrv9UQ&t=41.0s)]
*  people have said, I'm certainly not the first one to say it, but it's really true, I realized [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI7Cgsrv9UQ&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  as soon as I read it how true it was, I realized that when I was younger, I kind of absorbed [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI7Cgsrv9UQ&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  that Americans automatically add 20 IQ points to any British person who speaks with a posh [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI7Cgsrv9UQ&t=53.839999999999996s)]
*  British accent, they all think, oh, they're so brilliant, so eloquent, and that they subtract [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI7Cgsrv9UQ&t=61.16s)]
*  20% or 20 IQ points for anybody who speaks with a southern accent, an American southern [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI7Cgsrv9UQ&t=68.0s)]
*  accent, it's so true, like people's perceptions of who's smart and who isn't are very worked [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI7Cgsrv9UQ&t=74.24s)]
*  by those sorts of things. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI7Cgsrv9UQ&t=79.12s)]
*  And the relevance of Douglas Murray seems obvious to me, but he went on Joe Rogan's [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI7Cgsrv9UQ&t=83.2s)]
*  show today with Dave Smith, Joe Rogan doesn't usually have these kind of debates, got very [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI7Cgsrv9UQ&t=86.72s)]
*  heated, Rogan was clearly more on Dave Smith's side than Douglas Murray's side, and usually [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI7Cgsrv9UQ&t=90.96000000000001s)]
*  Joe Rogan's audience is pretty favorable to the show, basically the entire Joe Rogan audience, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI7Cgsrv9UQ&t=99.88000000000001s)]
*  which again is not left wing to put it mildly, was completely contemptuous of Douglas Murray, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI7Cgsrv9UQ&t=107.84s)]
*  they could not spew enough disgust and contempt for him intellectually, politically, and personally. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI7Cgsrv9UQ&t=113.60000000000001s)]
*  I don't think I've ever seen Joe Rogan's comment section be that universally disgusted [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI7Cgsrv9UQ&t=120.2s)]
*  and contemptuous of anybody since Matt Euglacius went on Joe Rogan's show, I mean I like mean [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI7Cgsrv9UQ&t=126.76s)]
*  internet comments as much as anybody else, but like I almost felt uncomfortable reading [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI7Cgsrv9UQ&t=133.32s)]
*  the comment section when Matt Euglacius went on, just because it was so mean, so incessantly [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI7Cgsrv9UQ&t=136.88000000000002s)]
*  mean, so personal, I mean they hated Matt Euglacius, it was when he had that book out [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI7Cgsrv9UQ&t=142.62s)]
*  about how America should have a billion people in it, and they hated the book, they hated [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI7Cgsrv9UQ&t=147.38000000000002s)]
*  the argument, they hated him, they hated how he looked, I mean everything about him. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI7Cgsrv9UQ&t=151.94000000000003s)]
*  But it came close with Douglas Murray, and I think it's so interesting because Douglas [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI7Cgsrv9UQ&t=156.46s)]
*  Murray usually won't go anywhere where he's challenged in any meaningful way, in fact, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI7Cgsrv9UQ&t=160.62s)]
*  on October 7th we asked Douglas Murray to come on our show several times, and at first [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI7Cgsrv9UQ&t=166.82s)]
*  he was responding, pretending he would, talking about scheduling, and then he just ghosted [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI7Cgsrv9UQ&t=169.98s)]
*  us and disappeared and won't hold on. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI7Cgsrv9UQ&t=174.46s)]
*  He doesn't want to be challenged, he wants to sit back in some chair, like he's in a [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI7Cgsrv9UQ&t=178.18s)]
*  British salon, and just he loves to hear himself speak, he thinks he's so eloquent, he knows [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI7Cgsrv9UQ&t=182.82s)]
*  Americans are like, oh my god, this is so brilliant, but he will never be challenged, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI7Cgsrv9UQ&t=188.38s)]
*  and he was challenged today a lot by David Smith and Joe Rogan, and he just fell apart, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI7Cgsrv9UQ&t=194.70000000000002s)]
*  fell apart. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI7Cgsrv9UQ&t=198.70000000000002s)]
*  It's really worth watching, it's entertaining, and I encourage you to read the comments section [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI7Cgsrv9UQ&t=199.70000000000002s)]
*  as well, but it's not just that it was a good internet fight, they talked about a lot of [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI7Cgsrv9UQ&t=204.84s)]
*  foreign policy issues, he came on, Douglas Murray did, and just became a full-on Karen [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI7Cgsrv9UQ&t=209.22s)]
*  for the first like 15 minutes, like whining and complaining to Joe Rogan about how he's [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI7Cgsrv9UQ&t=216.62s)]
*  talking to people he shouldn't be talking to, people who aren't worthy of being heard, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI7Cgsrv9UQ&t=220.74s)]
*  including Dave Smith, that didn't go well, and then the rest of it was just complete [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI7Cgsrv9UQ&t=225.34s)]
*  fuster. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI7Cgsrv9UQ&t=229.9s)]
*  So I recommend that, it was pretty illuminating as well, it's good when somebody like Douglas [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI7Cgsrv9UQ&t=232.42000000000002s)]
*  Murray, a hardcore Israel fanatic, a complete warmonger, someone who wants to send people [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI7Cgsrv9UQ&t=235.58s)]
*  to war all the time but never goes, is actually challenged, not in like an 8 minute cable [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI7Cgsrv9UQ&t=240.62s)]
*  hit where you really can't get at the person, but it was 2 and a half hours, and it's unrelenting [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI7Cgsrv9UQ&t=245.3s)]
*  that show. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI7Cgsrv9UQ&t=249.82s)]
*  I loved when I was on, but by the third hour I was like, is this ending? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI7Cgsrv9UQ&t=251.54s)]
*  It's tiring to focus that much, and when you're getting battered by Dave Smith, and more importantly [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI7Cgsrv9UQ&t=255.62s)]
*  for Douglas Murray, by Joe Rogan that way, you can definitely see him falling apart very [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI7Cgsrv9UQ&t=261.88s)]
*  quickly. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI7Cgsrv9UQ&t=266.74s)]
*  So I really recommend that. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI7Cgsrv9UQ&t=268.42s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI7Cgsrv9UQ&t=269.42s)]
