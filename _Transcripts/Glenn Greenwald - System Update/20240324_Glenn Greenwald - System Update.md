# The ACLU Has Become “Caricature” of Left-Liberal Culture
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [March 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI)
*  All right, the last story, the ACLU is an important organization for me. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=0.0s)]
*  It is something that really did play a significant part in forming my childhood politics, my [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=11.28s)]
*  political perspective. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=16.84s)]
*  I remember it very well when I was a kid reading about the decision of mostly leftist and Jewish [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=17.84s)]
*  ACLU lawyers to defend the right of the American Nazi Party to march through Skokie, Illinois, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=25.88s)]
*  a town filled with Holocaust survivors in 1977, purely on principle on the ground that [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=33.68s)]
*  the First Amendment has to protect the most hated people among us in order for it to be [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=40.12s)]
*  protected by anyone. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=44.96s)]
*  That ACLU was long ago dead. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=45.96s)]
*  The idea that it's a civil liberty organization now that's devoted to defending people's [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=49.08s)]
*  rights independent of their ideology. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=53.2s)]
*  They still do occasionally some of that work. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=55.24s)]
*  They are in fact right now defending the NRA against claims of New York State under Governor [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=58.52s)]
*  Cuomo persecuted the NRA for their political views. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=64.0s)]
*  So it's not like there aren't any lawyers left in the ACLU still do some of that work. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=66.72s)]
*  But by and large, overall, the ACLU is basically just like any other left liberal social justice [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=70.94s)]
*  organization. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=75.36s)]
*  As such, it has become paralyzed by a sort of caricature of a ridiculous left-wing, self-indulgent, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=77.36s)]
*  comical culture that constantly finds racism under every rock and bigotry under every rock. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=86.96s)]
*  As a result, they're constantly managing fights among one another where they're always accusing [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=92.0s)]
*  one another of being racist and sexist and transphobic and homophobic. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=99.28s)]
*  These organizations can't get anything done because the kinds of people they're attracting [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=103.08s)]
*  are the ones who spend most of their time attacking anyone near them. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=107.52s)]
*  Anyone who's worked inside a left liberal media outlet like The Intercept or an activist [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=113.16s)]
*  group or a governmental organization will tell you that they're often crippled with [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=116.92s)]
*  this kind of a mindset. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=124.2s)]
*  So the ACLU was the target this time's article about a particular lawsuit that I find extremely [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=125.56s)]
*  amusing just in terms of how extreme it is. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=134.4s)]
*  But on the one hand, it is extreme. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=136.8s)]
*  But on the other, it's very common in terms of what these left liberal outlets that are [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=139.6s)]
*  drowning in these culture wars that they themselves have bred are now facing. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=144.32s)]
*  So let's just take a look at the New York Times report. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  It's actually just kind of lets the report, the event speak for itself. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=150.8s)]
*  But clearly the idiocy of it jumps off the page. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=154.24s)]
*  So the headline is, the ACLU said a worker used racist tropes and then fired her. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=157.08s)]
*  But did she? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=162.4s)]
*  The Civil Liberties Group is defending itself in an unusual case that weighs what kind of [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=164.4s)]
*  language may be evidence of bias against black people. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=168.04000000000002s)]
*  Now basically what's happening here is the ACLU has an employee they fired because they [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=171.72s)]
*  claim she made racist statements against her black managers. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=177.76000000000002s)]
*  She herself is an Asian woman who has spent years claiming she's the victim inside the [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=183.76s)]
*  ACLU of sexism and other forms of abuse. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=189.12s)]
*  But because her supervisors, the ones about whom she was complaining are black, and they [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=193.64s)]
*  went to the ACLU and said she's a racist while she was saying they're sexist, the ACLU had [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=200.12s)]
*  to side with the black managers and say that she was guilty of hate speech and racism and [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=205.2s)]
*  therefore fired her. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=209.64s)]
*  And now she's suing them. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=210.64s)]
*  And in order to defend itself, the ACLU has to argue for a very broad definition of what [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=212.51999999999998s)]
*  hate speech means. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=216.92s)]
*  The exact opposite of what the ACLU is supposed to do, which is argue for a very limited view [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=219.27999999999997s)]
*  of what hate speech is and a very broad view of free speech. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=224.0s)]
*  But this is the kind of idiocy and just the kind of self-negation that these organizations [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=229.04s)]
*  get led into because of left-leve-o culture. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=233.04s)]
*  So let's take a look at this quote. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=234.83999999999997s)]
*  Kate Oh was no one's idea of it getting along to go along with an employee. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=236.51999999999998s)]
*  She considered herself a whistleblower and an advocate for other women in the office, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=241.52s)]
*  drawing unflattering attention to what environment she said was rife with sexism, burdened with [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=245.72s)]
*  unmanageable workloads and stymied by a fear-based culture. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=251.44s)]
*  So she envisioned herself a whistleblower inside the ACLU, calling out misogyny inside [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=256.0s)]
*  the ACLU, calling out toxic working conditions inside the ACLU. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=261.56s)]
*  Then the tables turned and Ms. Oh was the one slapped with an accusation of serious [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=268.36s)]
*  misconduct. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=272.48s)]
*  The ACLU said her complaints about several superiors, all of whom were Black, quote, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=273.48s)]
*  used racist stereotypes. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=278.56s)]
*  As a result, she was fired in May 2022, a trial and a case wrapped up this week in Washington [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=281.44000000000005s)]
*  and a judge is expected to decide in the next few months whether the ACLU is justified in [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=286.20000000000005s)]
*  terminating her. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=290.8s)]
*  The heart of the ACLU defense, arguing for an expansive definition of what constitutes [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=293.28s)]
*  racist or racially coded speech, has struck some labor and free speech lawyers as peculiar [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=299.32s)]
*  since the organization has traditionally protected the right to free expression, operating on [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=305.16s)]
*  the principle that it may not like what someone says but will fight to the right to say it. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=308.6s)]
*  A lawyer representing the ACLU, Ken Margolis, said during a legal proceeding last year that [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=312.6s)]
*  it was irrelevant, irrelevant whether Ms. Oh bore no racist ill will. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=317.34s)]
*  All that mattered, he said, was that her Black colleagues were offended and injured, quote, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=326.26s)]
*  we're not here to prove anything. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=332.29999999999995s)]
*  Other than the impact and her actions were very real that she caused harm, Mr. Margolis [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=334.85999999999996s)]
*  said according to a transcript of her remarks, she caused serious harm to Black members of [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=340.02s)]
*  the ACLU community. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=344.46s)]
*  She had this Asian employee who ran around for years accusing everybody of being asectus, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=345.58s)]
*  misogynist, abusive, and of course she was accommodated, like a hero, until the targets [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=352.38s)]
*  of her complaints started to be her Black supervisors. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=359.62s)]
*  And then her Black supervisors ran to the ACLU and said, I think her complaints against [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=364.62s)]
*  us are racist. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=368.09999999999997s)]
*  And the ACLU said, well, what has she said that's racist? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=369.58s)]
*  And the ACLU admits nothing she said was racist. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=375.38s)]
*  Doesn't matter, said the ACLU, in order to be a racist, in order to be able to be fired [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=378.86s)]
*  for racism, you don't have to say anything that's racist. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=383.14000000000004s)]
*  All that matters is that what you say makes Black people uncomfortable or offends them. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=386.70000000000005s)]
*  That's the standard of speech the ACLU is arguing for in order to defend itself from [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=392.42s)]
*  this lawsuit. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=398.74s)]
*  Here the New York Times goes on, quote, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=400.62s)]
*  Did her language add up to racism? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=402.41999999999996s)]
*  Or was she just speaking harshly about bosses who happened to be Black? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=404.97999999999996s)]
*  The question is the subject of an unusual unfair labor practice case brought against [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=408.56s)]
*  the ACLU by the National Labor Relations Board, which has accused the organization of retaliating [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=412.34s)]
*  against MISO. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=416.94s)]
*  So the NLRB, the Pro-Worker Union Agency is now bringing an action against the ACLU, claiming [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=417.94s)]
*  it treated its Asian worker unfairly by unjustly accusing her of racism. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=425.26s)]
*  Quote, a trial in this case wrapped up this week in Washington. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=430.98s)]
*  If the ACLU loses, it could be ordered to reinstate her or pay restitution. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=436.3s)]
*  The heart of the ACLU defense, arguing for an expansive definition of what constitutes [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=441.26s)]
*  racist or racially coded speech, has struck some labor and free speech lawyers as peculiar. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=445.7s)]
*  We went over that. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=451.38s)]
*  Essentially what the ACLU is doing is saying, oh, free speech is way narrower than you previously [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=452.78s)]
*  understood. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=460.26s)]
*  Hate speech is way broader. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=461.26s)]
*  Hate speech means not just that you said something that's actually racist, that we can prove [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=462.34s)]
*  harbors animosity toward a member of a marginalized group, such as an African American employee, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=468.14s)]
*  but if you say anything that even offends them or makes them uncomfortable, you are [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=475.02s)]
*  already out of the bounds of free speech and now into hate speech. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=478.02s)]
*  Imagine going back 30 years or 40 years and telling ACLU lawyers that in 40 years, ACLU [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=483.14s)]
*  lawyers are going to be in court desperately trying to limit the range of free speech and [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=489.34s)]
*  expand the concept of illegal hate speech for which you can be fired. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=492.86s)]
*  And that their definition would be, you become a racist, somebody who needs to be fired, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=498.1s)]
*  not because you said anything racist, but simply because you've made black people uncomfortable. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=502.62s)]
*  And the fact that it's an Asian employee who herself has obviously spent years focused [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=506.66s)]
*  almost entirely on accusing her colleagues of misogyny and racism and every other thing [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=512.86s)]
*  she can think of who's now victimized by that is just so illustrative of the fact that all [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=517.74s)]
*  of this is just all consuming. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=521.94s)]
*  It's unsustainable, this kind of left-wing culture. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=523.46s)]
*  And there have been reports, including by my former colleague Ryan Grimm at The Intercept, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=526.7s)]
*  on how a huge number, in fact, you could say most, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=531.5s)]
*  left-wing activist groups and advocacy groups and media organizations are completely crippled [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=535.58s)]
*  and paralyzed by exactly this kind of internal fighting. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=541.1s)]
*  Here from 2022, meltdowns have brought progressive advocacy groups to a standstill at a critical [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6RKGbIInI&t=543.66s)]
