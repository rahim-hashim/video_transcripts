# Israeli Policy DESIGNED to Starve Gaza
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [April 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y)
*  From the beginning of the war following the October 7th attack that Israel has been waging [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=0.0s)]
*  on Gaza, senior Israeli officials led by its then Defense Minister, Yov Golan, have explicitly [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=11.34s)]
*  threatened that they intended to cut off all humanitarian aid from entering Gaza, including [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=18.46s)]
*  food, water, and medicine. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=25.54s)]
*  This doesn't mean they're refusing to provide humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza, even [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=27.12s)]
*  though as an occupying army they are required to do so under international law, but no one [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=32.84s)]
*  expects that of Israel. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=36.74s)]
*  It's Israel. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=38.58s)]
*  They're not going to provide food and water and medicine to Palestinians in Gaza as they [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=39.58s)]
*  destroy their society, but they're doing something much more extreme, which is they're using [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=44.22s)]
*  their military paid for by the United States and American workers and taxpayers to block [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  any aid from entering. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=56.099999999999994s)]
*  There are humanitarian groups all over the world trying to put food into Gaza because [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=58.32s)]
*  generally the world considers it to be a singular atrocity to watch millions of people die of [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=62.98s)]
*  famine, deliberately caused famine. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=68.3s)]
*  You have countries trying to get an aid and medicine, watching children have to undergo [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=71.28s)]
*  incredibly horrific surgeries with no anesthesia because it's just not available in the Gaza [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=78.74s)]
*  Strip. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=83.46s)]
*  You've seen all the horror stories. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=84.46s)]
*  Those are deliberately induced by a blockade that the Israeli military has imposed on Gaza [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=85.53999999999999s)]
*  where they simply won't even let flour into the Gaza Strip. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=90.33999999999999s)]
*  As a result, it's no longer accurate to say that the people of Gaza are in the brink of [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=97.02s)]
*  starvation or that mass famine is imminent. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=102.53999999999999s)]
*  They're in the middle of it. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=106.5s)]
*  There's essentially no more food left. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=108.13999999999999s)]
*  Here from the BBC yesterday, quote, the UN agency runs out of food aid in Gaza after [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=111.58s)]
*  the Israeli blockade. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=117.5s)]
*  Quote, today, the World Food Program, this is them talking, delivered its last remaining [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=119.42s)]
*  food stocks of hot meals kitchens, it warned. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=125.82s)]
*  These kitchens are expected to fully run out of food in the coming days. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=129.74s)]
*  Israel cut off aid on March the 2nd and resumed its offensive two weeks later after the collapse [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=133.94s)]
*  of a two month ceasefire saying it was putting pressure on Hamas to release its remaining [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=139.4s)]
*  hostages. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=144.16s)]
*  In other words, using mass starvation as a weapon of war. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=145.16s)]
*  The UN says Israel is obliged under international law, which they don't care about, the United [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=148.94s)]
*  States doesn't care about, to ensure supplies for the 2.1 million Palestinians in Gaza. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=152.76s)]
*  Israel said it is complying with international law. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=158.36s)]
*  There is no aid shortage. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=160.56s)]
*  At the end of March, all 25 bakeries supported by the World Food Program in Gaza were forced [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=162.66s)]
*  after wheat flour and cooking fuel ran out. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=167.64000000000001s)]
*  Food parcels distributed to families containing two weeks rations were also exhausted. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=170.88000000000002s)]
*  Malnutrition is also rapidly worsening. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=175.72000000000003s)]
*  According to the UN last week, one of its humanitarian partners screened 1,300 children [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=177.72000000000003s)]
*  in northern Gaza and identified more than 80 cases of acute malnutrition, a two fold [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=182.60000000000002s)]
*  increase from previous weeks. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=188.48000000000002s)]
*  The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs says there are also severe shortages [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=190.68s)]
*  of medicine, medical supplies, and equipment for hospitals overwhelmed by casualties from [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=195.0s)]
*  the Israeli bombardment and that fuel shortages are hampering water production and distribution. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=199.76s)]
*  Now a couple things to note about this. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=204.92s)]
*  First of all, the World Food Program, because I've seen before any institution, any entity, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=208.0s)]
*  any country, any government, any person, any journalist, any media outlet that criticizes [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=214.68s)]
*  Israel immediately gets labeled as anti-Semitic, as hating Israel. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=219.16s)]
*  Anyone who criticizes Israel immediately gets called a racist. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=225.24s)]
*  That's just the go to tactic. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=227.51999999999998s)]
*  Or hating Israel or having some bad... [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=230.48s)]
*  The whole world, everyone's persecuting poor Israel even though the world's largest military [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=232.04s)]
*  and economy pay for their military, pay for their wars. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=237.44s)]
*  All of Europe has stood up in defense of Israel. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=242.88s)]
*  Somehow Israel is the poor little victim on the playground constantly being bullied. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=245.64s)]
*  They have all these UN organizations and Doctors Without Borders, people who do the most noble [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=250.68s)]
*  work of going around the world administering healthcare in the most dangerous way. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=257.96s)]
*  All these institutions are immediately deemed anti-Semitic the one time, the first time [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=261.4s)]
*  they say anything negative about Israel. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=267.12s)]
*  It's a little bit more difficult to do in the case of the World Food Program because [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=270.36s)]
*  its executive director is Cindy McCain. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=273.92s)]
*  She is the widow of former Senator and presidential candidate John McCain and the mother of media [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=278.56s)]
*  personality Megan McCain. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=285.64000000000004s)]
*  The McCain family has been as steadfast, as extreme, as loyal in their support for Israel [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=288.84000000000003s)]
*  as basically anybody in Washington. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=298.0s)]
*  To try and depict the McCain family, Cindy McCain, as some kind of Israel hater. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=300.16s)]
*  She was born into great wealth, she's using her platform to run the World Food Program [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=308.08s)]
*  which does work to alleviate famine wherever famine is found. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=314.44s)]
*  She didn't take it as a platform to criticize Israel, much to the contrary, as I said, the [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=320.64s)]
*  McCain family worships Israel. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=324.56s)]
*  As the executive director, she is basically duty bound to report the truth which is that [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=328.6s)]
*  there's no more food left in Gaza and they have no more food to distribute because all [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=335.6s)]
*  the stuff they were able to get into Gaza is now extinguished and exhausted and they're [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=340.56s)]
*  barred by the Israeli military from delivering more. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=345.48s)]
*  Here is the World Food Program itself on its ex-account yesterday, quote, the WFP has run [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=348.36s)]
*  out of food in Gaza as border crossings remain closed. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=353.68s)]
*  Two million people inside Gaza rely entirely on food assistance to survive. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=357.2s)]
*  The situation is at a breaking point. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=363.24s)]
*  We need food to reach Gaza. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=365.2s)]
*  We need access now. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=366.72s)]
*  I've seen people trying to claim, oh, this is a war. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=371.32s)]
*  This is what happens in war. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=374.12s)]
*  No, no, it's just not true. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=375.72s)]
*  Those wars do not entail the deliberate blockading and starvation of an entire population, a [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=378.84s)]
*  population in this case composed of 50% of children, trying to starve them to death or [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=385.67999999999995s)]
*  face the risk of the imminent death from starvation as a means to get their hostages back. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=391.47999999999996s)]
*  Of course, just like Israel was bombing everywhere in Gaza, claiming that they were concerned [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=398.76s)]
*  by their hostages and ended up predictably killing all of the hostages, obviously if [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=403.47999999999996s)]
*  you bomb indiscriminately in the places that you know the hostages are, you're going to [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=407.64s)]
*  end up killing many of them, as happened. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=411.36s)]
*  Similarly, if you starve an entire place to death, then there's no food to provide to [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=414.24s)]
*  the hostages either. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=422.08s)]
*  This is not something that the Israelis are doing by accident or incidentally as a by-product [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=425.03999999999996s)]
*  of war, starving the two million people in Gaza to death is absolutely an explicit open [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=430.52s)]
*  boast that Israeli officials, at least when they're speaking in Hebrew and sometimes even [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=437.59999999999997s)]
*  when they're speaking in English, are very proud that they're doing on purpose. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=444.44s)]
*  Here's a number that Knesset, the Israeli Knesset Moshe Sada, and he was on a network [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=450.28s)]
*  called Middle East Eye, and they asked him about the people who, including the children, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=459.96s)]
*  who have no food in Gaza, and here's what he said. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=465.47999999999996s)]
*  Yes, absolutely, it is our duty to expel the Gazans. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=471.35999999999996s)]
*  There are 10 countries in the world and we are ready to resort them. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=479.88s)]
*  This is our job. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=484.28s)]
*  If you say in the Israeli parliament, this is the interviewer, I want to starve Gazans, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=486.28s)]
*  understand the implications of that statement. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=494.47999999999996s)]
*  And he says, wasn't I clear? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=497.35999999999996s)]
*  It's simple, I want to starve Gazans completely, a full siege. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=498.55999999999995s)]
*  Anyone who wants to leave Gaza can leave for a humanitarian zone that we will control, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=503.03999999999996s)]
*  a zone that we control. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=507.44s)]
*  The Israeli army will distribute food in the zone. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=509.35999999999996s)]
*  And then the reporter says, how will you deal with the world's criticisms? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=511.84s)]
*  And he says, really, we've been there before, the world's criticism? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=515.2s)]
*  Forget about that. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=518.0s)]
*  We need to take care of Jews. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=519.84s)]
*  It's time. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=521.52s)]
*  And this is not anomalous. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=524.64s)]
*  There's nobody rising up in criticism of this MP. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=526.24s)]
*  You may recall that there were videos that were leaked to the press showing Israeli soldiers [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=533.28s)]
*  gang raping, helpless Palestinian detainees in the dungeons Israel keeps where they send [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=540.16s)]
*  them with no due process, no charges. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=545.12s)]
*  They just keep them there indefinitely. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=548.0799999999999s)]
*  And when these soldiers were caught gang raping, inally raping, helpless detainee Palestinians, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=550.24s)]
*  not only was there no revulsion in Israel, but members of the Knesset actually went and [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=559.1999999999999s)]

*  their release. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=569.28s)]
*  And you had people going on, media saying there's nothing wrong with rape. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=569.92s)]
*  Rape is a perfectly legitimate weapon of war. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=573.68s)]
*  These are not human beings we're dealing with. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=576.0s)]
*  These are savages. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=578.24s)]
*  They're not Jewish. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=580.3199999999999s)]
*  And this has been the ethos in Israel from the start. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=583.12s)]
*  Here is the former defense secretary Netanyahu has since fired him, Yoav Golan. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=586.16s)]
*  This was him on October 9th, 2023, saying what the Israeli strategy will be. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=592.4s)]
*  Quote, he says, we are imposing a complete siege on the city of Gaza. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=597.28s)]

*  Everything is closed. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=609.12s)]

*  When South Africa brought its case against Israel for war crime violations to the International [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=617.36s)]
*  Criminal Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court and now other governments have [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=623.44s)]
*  subsequently joined, their entire case basically existed of statements by Israeli officials [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=628.8000000000001s)]
*  about what they intended to do in Gaza. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=635.12s)]
*  Because Israeli officials have been saying the whole time, we're going to keep food out. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=637.9200000000001s)]
*  We're going to keep water out. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=640.8800000000001s)]
*  Like a lot of people, I am definitely not someone who enjoys going to the doctor. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=646.32s)]
*  I know it's important. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=650.6400000000001s)]
*  You know, it's checked up, the lab, the blood work. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=651.6s)]
*  But I still, in the back of my mind, plot ways to avoid it. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=654.24s)]
*  But I, of course, get why they matter and why I do it a lot. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=659.2s)]
*  It gives you peace of mind. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=662.72s)]
*  You can catch things early, even just making sure you're staying ahead of any health stuff [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=664.48s)]
*  that runs in your family. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=668.5600000000001s)]
*  Now, a lot of people get nervous about labs and blood results and I definitely empathize with that. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5h9UDPxx3Y&t=670.0s)]
