# Trump/Musk Attack CIA Fronts USAID & NED: With Mike Benz
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [February 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0)
*  Whether you like it or not, Donald Trump has deputized Elon Musk to head this agency that's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=0.0s)]
*  designed to eliminate waste as the White House sees it. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=11.84s)]
*  Wasteful spending, unnecessary spending. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=14.72s)]
*  And so when the people that are part of this effort that Donald Trump has created after [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=17.04s)]
*  he won the election went to USAID, and it's happened in other agencies too, you see almost [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=21.62s)]
*  as physical resistance, like how dare you come into our realm? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=27.32s)]
*  You don't run us. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=31.32s)]
*  You're just the elected part of the government. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=32.84s)]
*  Where this agency that exists, independent of you, where does this mentality come from [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=34.6s)]
*  that they have this right to pursue their own agenda independent of any elected officials [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=39.6s)]
*  or elected parts of the government? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=45.7s)]
*  Well, the entire agency exists as a carefully constructed lie. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  Just like James Clapper and John Brennan and Leon Panetta, these are the holders of the [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=56.12s)]
*  great American closet of skeletons of state secrets. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=64.12s)]
*  You don't just hand that over to a random taxi cab driver because 51% of the population [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=70.75999999999999s)]
*  elected him because he does funny TikTok dances. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=76.88s)]
*  I think what I'm trying to say here is if you remember the recalcitrance around sharing [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=80.24000000000001s)]
*  intelligence with President Trump, both in his 2016 presidential run and then again in [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=87.2s)]
*  the lead up to the 2024 election, I think what's happening at USAID is essentially an [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=93.4s)]
*  echo of that, which is that USAID is supposed to be untouchable. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=98.44s)]
*  I mean, virtually there's no USAID project on God's green earth that is honest. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=102.72s)]
*  If we are irrigating the agricultural fields in a country, it's because we're trying to [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=109.24s)]
*  control the territory there. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=116.8s)]
*  If we are working on the water supply, it's because we're trying to control the rivers. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=120.16s)]
*  If we're working on famine relief, it's because we're trying to control the food supply and [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=124.32s)]
*  make inroads into the indigenous populations there. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=128.48s)]
*  If we are helping them write their constitution and go through democratic legal reform, it's [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=131.54s)]
*  so that we can control their laws. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=136.56s)]
*  Every single thing USAID does is dual purpose. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=138.9s)]
*  It's dual purpose by charter. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=141.78s)]
*  They're only allowed to do the things that advance US foreign policy interest. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=143.34s)]
*  We just put a little bow on top of it and we say in the process, we're making the world [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=148.06s)]
*  a better place because it's going to these humanitarian groups who are administering [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=151.78s)]
*  this thing, which in the process will help US foreign interest. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=156.84s)]
*  The fact is the worst scandals in American statecraft in the 1960s and 70s and maybe [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=160.06s)]
*  early 80s were the CIA. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=168.94s)]
*  In recent years, the worst scandals in American statecraft have been USAID from funding the [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=172.22s)]
*  Wuhan lab to growing heroin in Afghanistan and irrigating the poppy fields to setting [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=179.5s)]
*  up fake Twitter in Cuba with an explicit USAID document saying that the plan is to have algorithms [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=188.04s)]
*  favoring sports news and hurricane updates and then once we have enough people, switch [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=196.08s)]
*  to get them to hate their government and topple their government and take to the streets and [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=200.22s)]
*  smart riots to them even using public health HIV prevention clinics as undercover for USAID [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=204.96s)]
*  workers doing intelligence work to get people to overthrow their governments. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=216.52s)]
*  This gets me to another point that I'd feel remiss if I didn't say because I've been thinking [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=220.44s)]
*  about it so long and haven't really had a venue to just kind of open say it. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=224.32000000000002s)]
*  Open and say everything that you want because this is the venue for it. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=229.28s)]
*  You recall how in 2011 the CIA was busted running a fake vaccine clinic in Pakistan. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=235.72s)]
*  Do you remember this? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=243.0s)]
*  Yeah, to find Osama bin Laden was their claim and they undercut all kinds of confidence [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=244.48s)]
*  for years. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=248.72s)]
*  That was the claim was they wanted to register these people in the hope of getting connection [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=249.72s)]
*  with the population but it was a fake vaccine program. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=253.26s)]
*  Vaccine activists were angry because they had worked so hard to build confidence in [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=256.2s)]
*  vaccines and it turned out that it was a whole fake plan and designed to get the United States [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=260.4s)]
*  to get data on Pakistanis. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=264.48s)]
*  Yes, right. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=266.72s)]
*  Had nothing to do with David Petraeus' counterinsurgency manual calling to collect 85% of the country's [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=268.6s)]
*  biometrics. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=273.08000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, it was just Osama bin Laden. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=274.08000000000004s)]
*  But the fact is, is they were caught flat busted in that situation with a fake vaccine [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=275.84000000000003s)]
*  drive, fake vaccine clinics and that was 2011. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=283.68s)]
*  It took them 16 months to issue a written statement, a non-binding written statement [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=289.94s)]
*  that they would no longer use vaccination work or public health work or public health [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=295.72s)]
*  facilities to do intelligence work out of. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=301.68s)]
*  So we have a non-binding written statement from the CIA that took them 16 months of fighting [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=304.64s)]
*  it to issue to say that we will no longer use our public health facilities as a front [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=310.08s)]
*  for CIA work. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=316.24s)]
*  Well, given that USAID is CIA, there is no daylight between those two organizations. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=317.88s)]
*  That is why you see the likes of AOC and Chuck Schumer saying that if Elon Musk gets access [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=325.2s)]
*  to the highly classified documents at USAID HQ, it will put US national security at grave [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=331.26s)]
*  risk. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=338.26s)]
*  Well, what is a humanitarian NGO, humanitarian aid NGO sponsor doing with so many troves [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=339.26s)]
*  of such highly classified state secrets that it will massively endanger all of US national [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=345.38s)]
*  security if somebody outside of USAID reads it? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=351.3s)]
*  That's the sort of thing that you typically would reserve for a CIA or NSA level document. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=354.18s)]
*  So the fact is, that's USAID for you. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=360.18s)]
*  But USAID is not under that obligation, this non-binding. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=363.42s)]
*  We don't know that when CIA pledged to not use public health facilities for intelligence [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=370.1s)]
*  work, that the baton wasn't just handed off to its identical twin cousin, USAID. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=377.02s)]
*  And I have an open question. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=385.1s)]
*  When you look at the fact, for example, that HIV clinics in Cuba in the Western Hemisphere [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=386.7s)]
*  were being used by USAID as cover for color revolution work, formal cover. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=391.21999999999997s)]
*  In fact, in their own documents, they said that the HIV program would be the perfect [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=397.42s)]
*  excuse because Cuban counterintelligence would never think to look there. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=401.94s)]
*  Well, how many other public health facilities operated by USAID are doing the same thing [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=406.41999999999996s)]
*  in South America, in Eastern Europe, in Central Asia? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=412.78s)]
*  And so I guess what I'm getting at here is turning over that level of scandal, it's bad [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=419.53999999999996s)]
*  enough if Americans know it. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=428.26s)]
*  But it becomes an international incident. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=430.38s)]
*  I mean, one of the things that I ran into at State Glenn, which you might find interesting [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=432.09999999999997s)]
*  is when we were trying to convince foreign countries to move off of Huawei, because it's [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=437.7s)]
*  backchanneled by the CCP and Chinese intelligence, we would get hit with a counterargument. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=443.38s)]
*  Well, you want us to use American IT architecture, but Snowden, we read the Snowden files. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=448.41999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, that was part of the big story that we published was that they were backdooring [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=455.62s)]
*  that same technology. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=459.9s)]
*  At the same time, they were telling people not to use the Chinese companies because they [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=460.9s)]
*  were backdooring it. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=465.21999999999997s)]
*  In fact, we were intercepting the devices that people around the world ordered, opening [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=466.3s)]
*  devices the FBI was and putting in the technology that would allow us to backdoor that equipment. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=471.22s)]
*  And of course, that created skepticism while we were trying to convince them not to use [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=475.42s)]
*  OI and other Chinese companies. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=480.26000000000005s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=483.26000000000005s)]
*  So the point that I'm driving at here is these things, the Snowden story is very easy to [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=485.26000000000005s)]
*  look at as an American. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=493.1s)]
*  And the concern that I think folks in the blob, folks in the national security complex [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=496.1s)]
*  and the international relations complex have is, you know, it's if only Americans learned [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=503.1s)]
*  how bad USAID was and what it was really doing. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=509.26s)]
*  For example, if that story I just mentioned in Bangladesh, if Americans had full access [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=512.82s)]
*  to everything that USAID and its spindle groups were doing in all these other countries, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=516.78s)]
*  that's one conversation. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=525.06s)]
*  That's bad enough, but maybe tolerable. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=526.4599999999999s)]
*  But the problem is, is when other countries learn about this, it becomes a diplomatic [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=528.38s)]
*  incident. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=533.9s)]
*  It becomes something that harms our standing with partnered nations and it makes neutrals [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=535.78s)]
*  want to turn to Russia and China instead of the United States because we look like [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=543.7s)]
*  the bad guy. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=547.94s)]
*  It harms our standing at the UN. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=549.1800000000001s)]
*  It allows foreign countries who may be hostile or neutral to us to hold up these scandals [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=551.4200000000001s)]
*  in front of the UN and move international favor against the US, which then can have [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=556.82s)]
*  trickle down effects on our national security, our economic engagements in various countries. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=563.1400000000001s)]
*  It can sever trust in countries that we're trying to court and that then harms the economic [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=571.14s)]
*  interests of all the different private sector companies who draft behind the battering ram [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=577.3399999999999s)]
*  of American statecraft. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=582.42s)]
*  Everything from the tech companies to the oil companies, you know, to you name it. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=584.38s)]
*  Let me ask you about that though because that I think is central to this whole discussion. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=590.18s)]
*  I mean, first of all, I think there's a lot of recognition of what the real function of [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=594.9s)]
*  net is and US aid is outside of the United States. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=601.5s)]
*  In fact, Russia expelled US aid because Hillary Clinton's State Department was funding all [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=605.7s)]
*  those agitations and anti-Putin protest movements on the street. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=610.86s)]
*  But then even just, you know, over the last couple of days, you have the president of [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=616.62s)]
*  pretty much tied to the international populist right saying nobody wants US aid in our countries. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=619.98s)]
*  It just destabilizes it. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=626.1800000000001s)]
*  It's designed to divide, as you were saying. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=628.0600000000001s)]
*  But then you have the president of Mexico who's very much on the left saying pretty [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=630.22s)]
*  much the same thing, that these aid are not here to help. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=634.4200000000001s)]
*  They're quite the opposite. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=639.38s)]
*  In some way, I think it's almost reversed. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=641.38s)]
*  It's like the world knows this. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=642.98s)]
*  It's Americans that don't. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=644.34s)]
*  And that's true of so many things. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=646.86s)]
*  But what I want to ask you is let me just ask you about the defense of people who defend [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=648.74s)]
*  US aid, including all these congressional Democrats who are marching in front of there [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=652.5s)]
*  as though they were defending something noble, the CIA front. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=657.42s)]
*  That's what the Democratic Party is now. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=660.9399999999999s)]
*  They would say, and I think defenders of the blob, the people on the blob would say, if [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=662.9399999999999s)]
*  you don't exert this influence in these other countries, even with the, especially with [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=668.6999999999999s)]
*  the pretense of helping, you know, we're building an irrigation system for you. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=673.54s)]
*  We're doing this. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=677.3s)]
*  And even though we have ulterior motives, if we withdraw from that, if we defund that, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=679.18s)]
*  China is just going to go in and do it, or the Russians will do it, or the Iranians will [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=683.02s)]
*  do it, and we will end up harming ourselves. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=686.38s)]
*  What about that argument? [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=688.8599999999999s)]
*  No, that's the. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=691.8599999999999s)]
*  There's a lot here. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=692.8599999999999s)]
*  And fundamentally, my hesitation in responding is because I don't know exactly what's motivating [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=695.74s)]
*  the high level thinking on this, because the answer to that question depends on what [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=707.54s)]
*  happens next. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=712.42s)]
*  Because technically, USAID HQ is set to shut down if Trump and Musk went on this. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=714.2199999999999s)]
*  But the plan is to fold it under the State Department. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=723.62s)]
*  And you know, I posted this on X just a little bit ago, but you know, the fundamental thrust [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=727.5799999999999s)]
*  of it was killing USAID does not end USAID. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=733.86s)]
*  Killing USAID as an organization does not end USAID as a function. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=739.42s)]
*  If the State Department is now inheriting the USAID's portfolio, so it's, USAID is essentially [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=744.86s)]
*  going to be, you know, the State Department's basically going to inherit a, I think I used [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=753.9s)]
*  the phrase USAID herpes complex attached. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=760.02s)]
*  It's basically going to be State Department with USAID herpes attached now. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=765.42s)]
*  Unless the actual programs are cut, the grants are cut, you know, in a sense, you know, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=770.46s)]
*  I was joking to a friend earlier, sort of lovingly tongue in cheek, but that, you know, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=777.5s)]
*  maybe I was joking that I don't really mean this, but yeah, that maybe this whole thing [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=783.62s)]
*  was Marco Rubio's idea so that he could, you know, be the most powerful Secretary of [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=788.26s)]
*  State in modern history running not just the State Department, but USAID as well. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=793.06s)]
*  Let me stop you there for a second. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=796.8199999999999s)]
*  I don't know if you saw this, but we have Rubio answering reporters' questions about [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=798.8199999999999s)]
*  how he's now the acting director of USAID. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=804.22s)]
*  And here's what he has to say. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=808.18s)]
*  I'm interested in your reaction to that. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=809.18s)]
*  Let's go ahead and play that. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=811.06s)]
*  USAID is the company of USAID and how does that picture fit in? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=812.06s)]
*  Well, look, I mean, my frustration with USAID goes back to my time in Congress. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=815.8599999999999s)]
*  It's a completely unresponsive agency. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=818.8599999999999s)]
*  It's supposed to respond to policy directives of the State Department and it refuses to do so. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=820.8599999999999s)]
*  So the functions of USAID, there are a lot of functions of USAID that are going to continue, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=827.8599999999999s)]
*  that are going to be part of American foreign policy, but it has to be aligned with American [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=832.8599999999999s)]
*  foreign policy. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=836.8599999999999s)]
*  I said very clearly when we, during my confirmation hearing, that every dollar we spend and every [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=837.8599999999999s)]
*  program we fund, that will be aligned with the national interest of the United States. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=843.66s)]
*  And USAID has a history of sort of ignoring that and deciding that they're somehow a global [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=848.66s)]
*  charity separate from the national interest. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=853.66s)]
*  These are taxpayer dollars. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=855.66s)]
*  And so I'm very troubled by these reports that they've been unwilling to cooperate with [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=856.66s)]
*  people who are asking simple questions about what does this program do, who gets the money, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=861.66s)]
*  who are our contractors, who's funded. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=865.66s)]
*  And that sort of level of insubordination makes it impossible to conduct a sort of mature [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=867.66s)]
*  and serious review that I think foreign a writ large should have. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=873.4599999999999s)]
*  We're spending taxpayer money here. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=876.4599999999999s)]
*  These are not donor dollars. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=878.4599999999999s)]
*  These are taxpayer dollars. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=879.4599999999999s)]
*  And we owe the American people the assurances that every dollar we are spending abroad is [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=880.4599999999999s)]
*  being spent on something that furthers our national interest. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=887.4599999999999s)]
*  And so far a lot of the people that work at USAID have just simply refused to cooperate. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=890.4599999999999s)]
*  So what is your reaction to that? [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=895.4599999999999s)]
*  And I don't know how well you can hear, but that gets to the thing that I was worried [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=897.4599999999999s)]
*  about, which is what they're really after here are the things that just don't matter. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=901.26s)]
*  You know, the actual just sort of like charitable stuff that some ideologue inside USAID decided [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=904.26s)]
*  to fund, but that they do want to continue the kinds of programs you were describing [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=910.26s)]
*  that in their minds do advance U.S. interest in a way that might involve bringing divisiveness [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=915.26s)]
*  to various countries. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=924.26s)]
*  Although then again, if you listen to other things Marco Rubio is saying, he does seem [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=925.26s)]
*  to think we're overextended and over involved in the world. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=928.26s)]
*  So I'm just kind of curious what your reaction to his perception is. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=930.66s)]
*  Well, I don't think USAID is ideological at all. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=935.66s)]
*  I actually think they are the most cold calculating ideologically agnostic organization in the [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=939.86s)]
*  U.S. federal government. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=947.66s)]
*  And to what Marco Rubio said there, that's the reason you park it at USAID. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=949.46s)]
*  It's because what if the in power administration at the State Department doesn't want something [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=955.42s)]
*  to be done or has a slightly different opinion on it? [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=962.42s)]
*  USAID allows basically a rogue group within the intelligence community to continue to [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=965.2199999999999s)]
*  carry out operations under the banner of being totally independent and silent away. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=971.5799999999999s)]
*  But I will note that under the Biden administration, before the major falling out towards the end [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=976.5799999999999s)]
*  with Kamala Harris and the sort of DNC Civil War that broke up what was a total party unanimity [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=983.5s)]
*  with the whip hand in Congress holding Congress, Congressional Democrats is a total block as [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=990.82s)]
*  well as at the executive level. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=999.42s)]
*  But if folks recall, USAID for the, it was born in the early 1960s, 1961, 62, it was [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=1000.86s)]
*  never on the National Security Council until just three years ago under Joe Biden. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=1007.86s)]
*  Joe Biden considered USAID to be so important that he put Samantha Powers on the National [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=1014.86s)]
*  Security Council to directly coordinate CIA and State Department interagency activity. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=1021.9s)]
*  And so the point I'm getting at here is there has to be a lot of work to be done to make [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=1030.42s)]
*  the difference between the CIA and Congress over oversight. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=1037.8999999999999s)]
*  This was the heart, for example, of the start of Bill Barr's career when he started his [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=1042.82s)]
*  career in the CIA and went to Knight Law School while working at the CIA and then his first [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=1046.74s)]
*  real substantive CIA job was as the CIA's liaison to Congress to block congressional [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=1053.3799999999999s)]
*  investigations into CIA malfeasance during Iran-Contra during the early Reagan years. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=1059.6999999999998s)]
*  The CIA gives out internal awards around operational security and there's weird histories with [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=1065.78s)]
*  some of that involving obfuscating congressional efforts to actually get access and oversight [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=1072.3s)]
*  to the CIA, even on the House and Senate Intelligence Committees. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=1081.34s)]
*  So USAID is able to block that out. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=1085.22s)]
*  USAID is basically doing the same sort of obfuscations that the CIA used to do, but [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=1088.98s)]
*  USAID is where the operations of CIA happen. CIA mostly plays the liaison role for operations, [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=1095.14s)]
*  but they have no assets to play with unless USAID capacity built them. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=1101.0200000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I think what all this reveals, at least as much as anything, is precisely the fact [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=1105.5s)]
*  that there is a massive part of our federal government that operates completely unto itself. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=1110.5800000000002s)]
*  They perceive their entitlement as operating outside of democratic accountability and the [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=1115.8200000000002s)]
*  fact that they are so resistant to any control by the executive branch, to any control by [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=1121.42s)]
*  the State Department, that the Democratic Party acts as though this is some grave assault [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=1126.74s)]
*  on the national interest to put them inside the State Department when they're getting [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=1131.1000000000001s)]
*  operating as an arm of the federal government anyway. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=1135.22s)]
*  I think it really reveals the fact that not only is there this deep state that has been [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtgT_u2rWs0&t=1138.5s)]
