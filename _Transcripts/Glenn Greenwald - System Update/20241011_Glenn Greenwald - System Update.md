# How Israel Squashes Dissent & Independent Reporting: With Journalist Dan Cohen
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [October 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc)
*  Joining us now is Dan Cohen who is a journalist at Uncaptured News. He has co-produced the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=0.0s)]
*  award-winning documentary Killing Gaza. He formerly produced video reports and print [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=12.72s)]
*  dispatches from Israel and Palestine, from Latin America, from the US-Mexico border while [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=17.0s)]
*  working as behind the headlines Washington correspondent. His most recent work covering [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=21.86s)]
*  the imprisonment of Jeremy LaFredo which we just discussed is what brings him here [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=26.02s)]
*  to our show tonight. He has really covered the story, knows the details of it and we [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=30.1s)]
*  are very thankful to have him on. Dan, it's great to see you. Thanks so much for coming [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=34.54s)]
*  on tonight. We appreciate it. Glad to be with you, Glenn. Alright, so let's start by talking [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=38.72s)]
*  about the Israeli version of events when it comes to the detention, arrest and now the [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=43.94s)]
*  very serious charges launched against Jeremy LaFredo who's been on our show. I know you [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=48.34s)]
*  know him and have a lot of respect for his work. What is it that the Israelis have done [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=53.68s)]
*  and what are they claiming justifies that? Well, Jeremy LaFredo was arrested I believe [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=58.6s)]
*  on Tuesday, October 8th. I have not been in touch with him so I don't have any direct [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=66.56s)]
*  contact but the Israelis accused him of aiding the enemy during wartime and providing information [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=72.2s)]
*  to the enemy. So I suppose what they are saying is that his report showing the damage [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=79.0s)]
*  that the Iranian missile strikes caused on Israeli military bases and near Mossad headquarters [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=85.0s)]
*  was that constitutes providing information to the enemy and aiding the enemy. Of course, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=92.72s)]
*  Iran may be happy to see that but as his lawyer actually pointed out in court, if he were [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=101.72s)]
*  trying to be a spy, if he were doing espionage, he wouldn't publish it. I mean that's just [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=108.58s)]
*  journalism. He would send it to them clandestinely or something like that. So it's completely [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=113.58s)]
*  absurd. So this was all based on the fact that Jeremy did not submit his video report [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=118.46s)]
*  that he published for the gray zone to the Israeli military censor which few people know [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=126.61999999999999s)]
*  that there is an entire military censorship regime that exists in Israel that all journalists [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=133.22s)]
*  are legally obliged by Israeli law to submit their work to, their written work, their videos [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=139.9s)]
*  and if they don't, they can be denied a press card or press accreditation from the Israeli [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=148.66s)]
*  government. So I think it's very much about narrative control. The thing is what came [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=155.46s)]
*  out in the court hearing was that Jeremy's, so Jeremy reported on these strikes specifically [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=162.86s)]
*  at the Neva team air base in the Negev desert in southern Israel and just outside the Mossad [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=171.58s)]
*  headquarters in northern Tel Aviv and in fact, PBS NewsHour correspondent Nick Schifrin actually [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=177.70000000000002s)]
*  reported on the missile strike, the damage, this huge pit and damage to vehicles very [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=184.7s)]
*  close to the Mossad headquarters days before Jeremy did and published this and was not [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=191.7s)]
*  punished at all. There was no issue for him. Did he submit his report to the Israeli military [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=197.7s)]
*  censor? I don't know. So if he did, then it shows that the same information was completely [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=204.7s)]
*  allowed. If he didn't, then it shows that he was not punished. So either way, it's completely [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=209.5s)]
*  arbitrary and a punishment of Jeremy Lofredo, his arrest and detention and in addition to [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=216.5s)]
*  that, the Israeli website Ynet, Yediot HaRonoth and I24, both Israeli publications, they published [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=223.5s)]
*  articles on Jeremy Lofredo's arrest in which they included Jeremy's report. His entire [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=230.5s)]
*  video report was embedded in these online articles and those, at least the Yediot Ynet [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=237.5s)]
*  report was actually approved by the military censor. So all of the information that Jeremy [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=244.5s)]
*  published was approved by the military censor. So basically, Jeremy's report was approved [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=249.5s)]
*  by the military censor. So basically what happened is when this was argued in court, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=257.5s)]
*  the judge who was overseeing the case said, okay, then we have to release him. There's [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=263.5s)]
*  no grounds to hold him. But then the police came back and said, well, we spoke to the [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=270.5s)]
*  actual censor and they said that when the Yediot report did not actually submit the [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=277.5s)]
*  report to the censor until it was already published and so therefore they just said, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=286.5s)]
*  well, it's already published so we'll just go along with it. So on that basis, they extended [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=293.5s)]
*  Jeremy's detention another 24 hours. The judge approved the police appeal and he will be [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=301.5s)]
*  back in court on Friday. But what's clear to me is the entire thing is completely arbitrary. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=308.5s)]
*  Nick Schifrin from PBS NewsHour is not in jail and he shouldn't be. Of course I'm saying, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=315.5s)]
*  I'm being entirely consistent that he should not be punished, he should not be imprisoned, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=321.5s)]
*  but you'd think that he should at least speak out considering an independent journalist, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=325.5s)]
*  a fellow journalist is being punished for the exact same thing that he did. And the [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=329.5s)]
*  other two, the Yediot and I-24 cases show that the Israelis actually don't have any [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=334.5s)]
*  real problem with this information coming out. I think it's just that they want it to [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=340.5s)]
*  come out from approved sources. They don't want some independent journalist digging [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=344.5s)]
*  around, getting his nose in places they don't really want and embarrassing them, as you [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=350.5s)]
*  said. Well, just a couple things about that. So the charges that have been lodged against [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=355.5s)]
*  him consist of two different allegations. One is that he failed to submit his reporting [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=362.5s)]
*  to the Israeli censorship regime as required by the region's only democracy, Israel, which [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=369.5s)]
*  apparently, and you can read oftentimes, it's amazing, you read in Haritz or other Israeli [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=375.5s)]
*  press when they release even benign information, like there was that terrorist attack that [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=380.5s)]
*  killed I think six Israelis with two gunmen on a bus last week. And when Haritz published [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=384.5s)]
*  the identities of the victims, the people who were dead, they made very clear they were [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=392.5s)]
*  allowed to publish the names because the Israeli censors had cleared it. So let's say [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=396.5s)]
*  there's an Israeli censorship regime and Jeremy did not go through all of the processes to [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=401.5s)]
*  get permission to report this, in no other instance, say in Russia or China or Iran, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=405.5s)]
*  we would consider it justifiable to imprison a journalist for failing to get the approval [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=411.5s)]
*  of censors from those governments. But let's leave that aside. Let's say that he didn't [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=418.5s)]
*  go through those processes of the Israeli censorship regime. The other obviously more [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=423.5s)]
*  serious charge is that he aided and abetted Iran by publishing this information. Now, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=428.5s)]
*  you made the point, obviously the quite relevant point, that there was another journalist who [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=433.5s)]
*  published the same information, which means Jeremy's publication of that reporting did [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=438.5s)]
*  not tell Iran anything they didn't already know as a result of that reporting. But even [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=442.5s)]
*  absent that, to me, it seems ludicrous that a country as sophisticated as Iran that just [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=447.5s)]
*  proved for the second time that they have the capabilities to launch highly sophisticated [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=455.5s)]
*  ballistic missiles guided with great precision inside Israel to targets they knew existed, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=460.5s)]
*  even though they're classified like the Mossad headquarters in this Air Force base who have [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=467.5s)]
*  satellite imagery of anything required to those didn't already know where their missiles [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=471.5s)]
*  landed and the damage that it did. Is it even theoretically possible that by driving outside [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=476.5s)]
*  of an Air Force base, Jeremy LaFrayda was able to discover things that the Iranian military [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=483.5s)]
*  and intelligence didn't already know? Well, not a chance. I mean, when Jeremy's report [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=488.5s)]
*  from near the Neva Team Air Force base didn't even show actual damage to the base itself, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=496.5s)]
*  he showed the wreckage of a missile nearby in a Bedouin, an unrecognized Bedouin village nearby [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=503.5s)]
*  the base. Let alone we had already seen the videos that came out of numerous strikes hitting [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=510.5s)]
*  Neva Team Air Base. So there's no question about it. There were also aerial photographs, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=516.5s)]
*  satellite photographs that showed damage. So there was no secret about that. And the only other [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=523.5s)]
*  one was the Mossad headquarters in Tel Aviv, which as we know were pointed out, if you watch [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=528.5s)]
*  the video by Nick Schifrin, which is still on his Twitter to this day, at this moment, he points out [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=535.5s)]
*  the Mossad headquarters are right behind him. He's standing in front of a massive pit, 30 feet deep [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=542.5s)]
*  and 50 feet wide, he says, and there's the Mossad headquarters directly behind me. The only difference [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=549.5s)]
*  Jeremy added the coordinates, the GPS coordinates for the Mossad headquarters. But again, as you [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=554.5s)]
*  pointed out, there's no way that Iran's intelligence military is unable to figure out where the Mossad [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=563.5s)]
*  headquarters... They shot at it. They shot at the Mossad headquarters. They know exactly where it is. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=570.5s)]
*  Exactly. I know this might be a little bit of a speculation, but I'm just going to use my own [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=575.5s)]
*  experience before. I know when I started doing the Stoden reporting and the strategy we used, both Laura [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=580.5s)]
*  Poitras and I, who were unaffiliated, in an employment way with any major media outlet, that's why [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=584.5s)]
*  Stoden came to us, was that, look, we can't really just do this on our own because if we do, it's going [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=590.5s)]
*  to be much easier to demonize us. We kind of commandeered the American media to get on our side by [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=595.5s)]
*  working with The Washington Post in her case and The Guardian in my case, eventually The New York Times [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=601.5s)]
*  and other major outlets around the world. I did the same in Brazil when I did reporting that I knew [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=605.5s)]
*  if I had done by myself, it would have been a lot easier to criminalize what I was doing. Instead, we [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=611.5s)]
*  partnered with large media outlets. It's not just that Jeremy is independent. It's that he has worked [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=615.5s)]
*  with The Grey Zone, which is as vocal and aggressive a critic of Israel as it gets. On top of that, he [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=620.5s)]
*  has done, as we reviewed, a lot of reporting, great reporting, that embarrassed Israel as well, showing [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=629.5s)]
*  for example, Israeli settlers bringing their children to block humanitarian aid such as food from [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=635.5s)]
*  entering into Gaza. It's hard not to believe that that did not play some role, if not the major role, in [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=640.5s)]
*  why the Israelis wanted to arrest him and charge him with these crimes. What do you think about that? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=647.5s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's a fair assessment. Jeremy has been one of extremely few, if not the only, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=653.5s)]
*  independent journalists I can think of that has gone to Israel over the past year, since October 7th, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=662.5s)]
*  and shown what is actually happening in Israeli society with the blockade on the aid trucks going into [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=670.5s)]
*  Gaza that you showed, showing the fanatical settlers in the West Bank and their overtly genocidal [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=679.5s)]
*  speech. And now this. I think they do not want pesky independent reporters going around. They want [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=686.5s)]
*  basically, I'll put it this way, in order to get an Israeli press credential, which technically you have [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=694.5s)]
*  to do if you want to be a journalist in Israel at all, you have to go to the Israeli government press [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=701.5s)]
*  office and basically show that the outlet you work for gets enough views on a daily basis that it [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=706.5s)]
*  basically weeds out the small guys. So if you're an independent journalist, you're not going to be [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=715.5s)]
*  really allowed to do journalism. You need to stay kind of on the down low and avoid brushing up with [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=721.5s)]
*  any kind of authorities or anything like that, and you won't be allowed into any kind of official events [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=727.5s)]
*  back in the period when you could get into the Gaza Strip. The only way I was able to get in was I got a [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=732.5s)]
*  press card, but I basically deceived to, I said that I was working for Alternet, and I had barely done [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=740.5s)]
*  any work for Alternet, and because I'm a nice Jewish American guy named Dan Cohen, they were not as [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=747.5s)]
*  skeptical, and so they approved it, but that was the only way I could do it. And I did my work and made [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=753.5s)]
*  the documentary, Killing Gaza, but once they kind of figured out what I was doing, that was it. They [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=759.5s)]
*  wouldn't give me a visa anymore, let alone a press card. So it's very much about narrative control, and [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=764.5s)]
*  yes, I think you're right, that it's about punishing Jeremy so he doesn't want to come back, so others [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=770.5s)]
*  who might think of going there will think twice about going to Israel and maybe being thrown in [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=777.5s)]
*  detention or taken to a military base and roughed up or even beaten, so they don't want to do it. So I [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=786.5s)]
*  think it's fair to say that this is really about sending a message when you look at the arbitrary nature [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=793.5s)]
*  of Jeremy Lofredo's punishment. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=798.5s)]
*  So there's that side of it, which is the Israeli ability to punish him based on the perception that he's [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=800.5s)]
*  just an independent journalist, but then there's the other side, which is the American media and the [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=806.5s)]
*  American government, which just from a very surface level reflexive analysis would suggest should be [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=811.5s)]
*  rising up in defense of the free press rights of their fellow American journalist and their American [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=819.5s)]
*  citizen. And I've seen over the years probably the thing that has driven me the craziest is that [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=825.5s)]
*  Julian Assange sat in a dungeon for five and a half years for doing some of the most important [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=831.5s)]
*  reporting while the American media said virtually nothing. There was an independent journalist in Ukraine, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=836.5s)]
*  Goncalo Lira, who lost his life and who said he was going to die because the Ukrainians intended to put him [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=842.5s)]
*  in prison for criticizing the war effort. Not a word. You can barely find coverage of that in the American [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=848.5s)]
*  media, let alone any denouncement, but then when one of their own, this Wall Street Journal reporter, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=853.5s)]
*  Evan Gurschowicz, is detained and arrested and charged by Russia, it becomes this massive crusade on the [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=858.5s)]
*  part of the corporate media, which I wouldn't have a problem with if they weren't so selective about it. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=865.5s)]
*  So I feel very safe predicting that if Jeremy remains in prison or even if he's released shortly, there will [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=870.5s)]
*  be almost no coverage, let alone crusade in his behalf on the part of the American media. Why do you think [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=878.5s)]
*  that is? Is it because they perceive independent journalists as sort of not legitimate and not one of them? [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=887.5s)]
*  Or is it because in this case it's Israel doing it and they're loathe to criticize Israel? Or is it a combination of both? [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=892.5s)]
*  You know, I think probably for the individual journalists, even the ones who may see this and think it's bad, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=900.5s)]
*  if they speak out, that's obviously the end of their career. They're going to be out of the Washington Post or PBS [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=907.5s)]
*  or whatever it may be. There may also be an ideological thing where we don't like what Jeremy's doing and therefore [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=914.5s)]
*  we're going to suspend our principles. We're going to abandon our principles because we actually kind of want to see him [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=923.5s)]
*  get punished. But I think in the bigger picture, it's all about geopolitics. It's all about the US. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=930.5s)]
*  Everything we saw, the outpouring of sympathy that we saw for Evan Gershwitch, the Wall Street Journal reporter, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=941.5s)]
*  was, as you said, it was a total contrast to what's happening now, to what happened to Assange. I mean, I look at, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=949.5s)]
*  there was another reporter named Pablo González who was a Spanish-Russian citizen. He was held without charges, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=957.5s)]
*  never charged in administrative detention in Poland for about two years. And he was only released about a month ago [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=964.5s)]
*  thanks to the intervention of actually Russian President Vladimir Putin. This guy's a dual Russian-Spanish citizen. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=973.5s)]
*  And the Spanish government did literally nothing for him. They completely abandoned him. So the only reason he's out [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=980.5s)]
*  is because of, out of our NATO partners' prison in Poland is because of Putin. So this is the West in general, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=986.5s)]
*  not only the United States, but it's EU and NATO allies that are perfectly happy to see their own citizens suffer in prison [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=996.5s)]
*  or whatever may happen to them because those are their allies doing it. And Israel doesn't, or the United States [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=1005.5s)]
*  certainly doesn't want Israel to be embarrassed because the Biden administration and basically the bipartisan war machine [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=1013.5s)]
*  is totally joined at the hip with Israel and wants regime change in Lebanon and Iran and wants, you know, to, [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=1020.5s)]
*  it still has fantasies about destroying, overthrowing Hamas in Gaza. So, I mean, everything I think is subservient to the, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=1026.5s)]
*  to geopolitics. Yeah, including the liberty and the lives of American citizens. We didn't even mention [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=1036.5s)]
*  Shireen Abouakla, who was shot in the head by IDF forces while wearing a press vest. They first lied about it, tried to claim it was [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=1044.5s)]
*  Palestinians who shot her when that became untenable. They admitted it was them. They claimed it was an accident. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=1051.5s)]
*  And reports proved that it was actually deliberate. And the number of Americans who know that happened has to be [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=1056.5s)]
*  infinitesimal because it barely got any coverage in the media. All right. Well, Dan, I'm very appreciative of your coverage of this. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=1062.5s)]
*  I learned a lot of the details about what is going on in Jeremy's case in Israel through your reporting both online and elsewhere [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=1070.5s)]
*  where you're doing your reporting. So we'd love to have you come back on to sort of fill us in on how this story proceeds because it's [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=1077.5s)]
*  definitely something we intend to cover. Absolutely. Thank you, Glenn. All right. Have a great evening, Dan. Thanks so much. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0c7-pXjQc&t=1083.5s)]
