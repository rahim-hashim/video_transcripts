# Senator Patrick Leahy's Memoir Reveals His COWARDLY Failure to Prevent Iraq War
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [May 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs)
*  So here's the first one from the far side who wrote the following quote, I have a question [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=0.0s)]
*  for Glenn. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=11.88s)]
*  Oh, you're in the right place. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=12.88s)]
*  I have a question for Glenn. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=14.3s)]
*  I saw a post about Patrick Leahy's new memoir where he recounts and just by the way, Patrick [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=15.3s)]
*  Leahy is a former senator from Vermont, Democratic Senator, a long time senator, just like one [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=20.66s)]
*  of those people who stayed around for 30 years. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=27.28s)]
*  And he has a new memoir where he recounts that in the lead up to the invasion of Iraq, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=29.720000000000002s)]
*  so 2002, 2003, some shadowy figures directing him to request certain top secret intelligence [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=34.24s)]
*  documents showed that Bush and Cheney were lying to the country about the Iraq War. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=40.68s)]
*  He acknowledges that he was therefore able to get a hold of the information in that, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=47.040000000000006s)]
*  although perhaps as a result, he was one of the few senators to vote against the war for [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=50.6s)]
*  reasons unknown, he kept the information to himself rather than, for example, disclosing [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=54.8s)]
*  on the Senate floor where he would have had immunity for doing so. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=59.879999999999995s)]
*  That strikes me as quite an amazing admission. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=63.5s)]
*  Would love to hear your thoughts on this. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=65.92s)]
*  Yeah, I totally agree with that point of view. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=68.84s)]
*  And I've seen this happen many times before when senators and Congress members access [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=73.56s)]
*  classified material and they're too scared to show it to the public even though they [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=80.12s)]
*  could do so on the floor of the Senate or the House and they enjoy absolute complete [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=85.80000000000001s)]
*  immunity. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=89.92s)]
*  You cannot be prosecuted or criminalized or arrested for anything you say on the floor [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=90.92s)]
*  of the Congress. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=94.4s)]
*  It's just written into the Constitution. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=95.4s)]
*  It's legislative immunity. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=97.26s)]
*  And they could just go and do it. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=101.04s)]
*  They could just go and reveal it, but they almost never do. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=104.92s)]
*  They leave it up to people like Edward Snowden or Julian Assange or other courageous whistleblowers [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=109.02s)]
*  to do it even though they don't have immunity, but these senators do and just conceal this [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=113.97999999999999s)]
*  information. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=118.34s)]
*  So here's what he wrote in his memoir, The Road Taken by Patrick Leahy. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=119.34s)]
*  By the way, it's not a new memoir. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=124.78s)]
*  It's from 2022. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=126.89999999999999s)]
*  It was just a couple of years ago, but it just got resurfaced and started viralizing [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=127.89999999999999s)]
*  on acts. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=131.9s)]
*  I think a lot of people didn't know about it who would sit down and read Pat Ley's book. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=132.9s)]
*  I certainly didn't. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=136.62s)]
*  But here's part of what he wrote in telling this story. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=138.02s)]
*  Quote, my conclusion was caution. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=141.06s)]
*  I simply didn't see proof of an imminent threat or a new rush by a madman to obtain weapons [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=143.56s)]
*  of mass destruction. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=151.66000000000003s)]
*  I saw the status quo as it had been for a long time. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=152.66000000000003s)]
*  Quote, looks like the Middle East, I said to the intelligence officer sitting at the [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=155.94s)]
*  desk. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=159.06s)]
*  The following Sunday, my wife Marcel and I went for our usual early morning walk in [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=160.06s)]
*  the neighborhood. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=165.02s)]
*  It was a warm September day and we walked hand in hand. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=166.18s)]
*  Two fit joggers trailed behind us. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=170.56s)]
*  They stopped and asked what I thought of the intelligence briefings I'd been getting. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=172.82s)]
*  Marcel, his wife, realized this was a conversation that normally she would not have been involved [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=177.06s)]
*  in and kept on walking ahead. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=181.38s)]
*  I went through a requisite disclaimer that if I was in a briefing and if they were classified, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=183.74s)]
*  I could not acknowledge that even occurred and could not talk about them if they had. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=187.18s)]
*  They told me they understood that but asked me whether the briefers had showed me file [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=192.58s)]
*  8. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=196.34s)]
*  So imagine you're just walking on the street with your wife, just like an old couple walking [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=199.34s)]
*  the street and out of nowhere there's like very fit joggers behind you and they are obviously [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=203.42000000000002s)]
*  following you and they stop and they say, hey, we hear you're bringing in the briefings, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=210.62s)]
*  how have those been going? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=214.46s)]
*  And you say, fine, but I can't talk about them. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=215.46s)]
*  They're like, no, no worries, we don't want to talk about them. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=217.34s)]
*  Just take a look at file 8. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=218.94s)]
*  Have you seen that? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=220.34s)]
*  And he writes, quote, it was obvious from the look on my face that I had not seen such [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=222.1s)]
*  a file. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=225.3s)]
*  They suggested I should and that I might find it interesting. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=226.3s)]
*  Quickly thereafter, so that's it, they were like, hey, go see file 8. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=230.66s)]
*  Quickly thereafter, I arranged to see file 8 and it contradicted much of what I had heard [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=234.38s)]
*  from the Bush administration. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=238.78s)]
*  Days later, my wife Marcel and I were out walking again when the two joggers reappeared. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=241.94s)]
*  After the opening greetings, they told me they understood I had seen file 8 and asked [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=247.98s)]
*  me what did I think about it. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=251.82s)]
*  It was the eeriest conversation I'd experienced in Washington. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=253.22s)]
*  I felt like a senatorial version of Bob Woodward meeting deep throat, only in broad daylight. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=257.98s)]
*  I went to the usual disclaimers that I could not talk about any file and if such a file [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=263.65999999999997s)]
*  was available and so on. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=266.74s)]
*  They said, of course they understood, but they wondered if I had also been shown file [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=267.9s)]
*  12 using a co-word. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=272.06s)]
*  They're like, hey, remember when we mentioned file 8? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=275.46s)]
*  We're glad you took a look at that. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=278.14s)]
*  No, no, don't worry, we don't need to hear your opinion, we just want to know you should [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=279.14s)]
*  look at file 12 too. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=283.46s)]
*  He says, quote, again, I gave them, I think the look on my face gave them the answer. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=286.02s)]
*  They apologized for interrupting our walk and jogged off. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=289.98s)]
*  The next day I was back in the secure room in the Capitol to read file 12 and it again [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=293.78s)]
*  contradicted the statements that the administration and especially Vice President Cheney seemed [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=298.38s)]
*  to be relying on. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=302.18s)]
*  And I told my staff and others that for a number of reasons I absolutely intended to [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=304.28s)]
*  vote against the war in Iraq. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=307.84s)]
*  Now according to Pat Leahy, he had been directed to by mysterious deep state operatives, obviously. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=312.79999999999995s)]
*  Two classified files that had not been shown by the People Briefing Congress on the Iraq [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=324.23999999999995s)]
*  War, both of which he says proved that the government was lying to the American people. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=328.84s)]
*  Now you would think, I would think that somebody in that position would be like, hey, I need [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=337.44s)]
*  to show the American people this, I need to alert the American people to the fact that [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=341.02s)]
*  there are documents inside the government's own file that prove that what Dick Cheney [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=344.71999999999997s)]
*  and George Bush were saying about the war in Iraq are lying. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=349.91999999999996s)]
*  I should let the American people know that they're being deceived and tricked yet again [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=353.35999999999996s)]
*  into supporting a war. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=357.23999999999995s)]
*  But no, he didn't do that. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=358.56s)]
*  He was like, yeah, I let people know around me, I'm going to vote against it. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=359.56s)]
*  Yeah, great, great job, Senator Leahy. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=362.88s)]
*  The vote was 77 to 23 in favor of the Iraq War. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=365.04s)]
*  Congratulations on your super consequential no vote. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=369.72s)]
*  Who knows what would have happened had he come forward the way any minimally courageous [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=373.24s)]
*  or ethical person would have. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=377.92s)]
*  And again, he had legal immunity to do it. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=379.72s)]
*  He could have read the whole file on the Senate floor and nothing would have happened. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=384.20000000000005s)]
*  Even if he didn't have immunity, I would think he would be duty-bound when the government [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=388.48s)]
*  is selling a war to the population, a very serious invasion on the other side of the [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=392.44s)]
*  world, not a few bombs being dropped. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=397.64s)]
*  And you have proof that what the government is saying is lying, but that's not what Pat [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=400.52s)]
*  Leahy did. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=403.2s)]
*  And he even admitted that in his book. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=404.2s)]
*  Like, you're not even realizing there's anything wrong with it. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=405.92s)]
*  There's a woman on X who I find to be genuinely one of the smartest and most interesting X [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=410.48s)]
*  accounts to follow. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=416.56s)]
*  Her X name is Village Crazy Lady, but her name is Mel. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=417.84s)]
*  She is very upfront. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=423.56s)]
*  She does a podcast. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=425.88s)]
*  She's a MAGA woman, self-identified MAGA woman from the South. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=428.0s)]
*  And yet she really actually believes in MAGA principles. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=432.79999999999995s)]
*  She is vehemently opposed to all kinds of intervention. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=435.12s)]
*  She's opposed to funding the war in Ukraine, funding Israel's war in Gaza, going to war [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=441.2s)]
*  with Iran, bombing Yemen, all the things that we were promised that Trump would do in foreign [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=445.40000000000003s)]
*  policy. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=452.40000000000003s)]
*  She actually believes in it and insists on it and complains when it doesn't happen as [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=453.40000000000003s)]
*  she should. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=456.32s)]
*  And she's just very smart. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=457.32s)]
*  She's just always plugged into what I think are the right things, thinking about things [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=459.32s)]
*  that are really interesting. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=463.2s)]
*  I actually learned a lot from following her. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=464.2s)]
*  I'm going to have her on the show soon. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=465.2s)]
*  And she was the one who alerted me to this. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=467.8s)]
*  I think she was probably the one who alerted a lot of people to this. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=470.68s)]
*  She said, quote, I think about this thread all the time. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=474.6s)]
*  A sitting U.S. senator admitting that days before Congress voted to invade Iraq, he was [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=477.76s)]
*  contacted by two shadowy figures jogging in the park who directed him to view the contents [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=481.96s)]
*  of, quote, File 8 in the intelligence briefing prepared for Congress. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=487.16s)]
*  The next day, late, he goes to the SCIF, which is the Room for Classified Information in [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=490.68s)]
*  Washington and polls File 8. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=497.48s)]
*  And lo and behold, it contains information directly disputing public statements made [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=499.08s)]
*  by the Bush administration about Iraq's WMDs. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=502.92s)]
*  Few days later, late, he is in the same park and the same joggers come up to him and tell [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=506.6s)]
*  him to request a viewing of, quote, File 12. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=509.96000000000004s)]
*  Late, he goes back to the SCIF and again views Intel that directly contradicts public statements [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=512.04s)]
*  being made by Dick Cheney at the time. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=516.9200000000001s)]
*  The info convinces late he to vote against the invasion. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=519.32s)]
*  But we all know it doesn't matter. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=522.16s)]
*  The final Senate vote was 77 yeas to 23 nays. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=523.44s)]
*  Just imagine if late he or any of the other senators who presumably saw the same thing [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=527.8000000000001s)]
*  cared more about the country and the Constitution than they did about respecting the rules of [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=531.0s)]
*  classified documents. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=535.04s)]
*  Imagine if they had gone public with what they saw, evidence that Bush and Cheney were [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=536.36s)]
*  lying to the American people. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=539.8s)]
*  They could have prevented the whole catastrophe that was the Iraq War. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=541.88s)]
*  Once again, we hear the war drums in the distance. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=546.4s)]
*  This time it's Iran. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=548.32s)]
*  Let's pray that if we get to that point again, there will be at least one American senator [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=549.4s)]
*  who will have the courage to do what late he did not. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=552.48s)]
*  I think what's really notable too is imagine that you're those two guys who obviously are [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=557.4s)]
*  risking your career, probably risking your liberty to try to make sure that Pat Leahy [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=561.88s)]
*  sees not just circumstantial evidence but proof that the Bush and Cheney administration are [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=570.2s)]
*  lying about the key arguments they're trying to sell to the public to justify the invasion [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=577.4s)]
*  of Iraq. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=581.8000000000001s)]
*  And they put themselves on the line. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=583.9200000000001s)]
*  They put themselves at risk because they apparently thought it was important for the truth to [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=585.68s)]
*  be known. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=590.64s)]
*  And they get Leahy to go read both of those files and he just does nothing, nothing to [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=592.88s)]
*  tell the public. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=598.1999999999999s)]
*  He's just like, yeah, I'm going to vote no. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=599.1999999999999s)]
*  He didn't even tell his fellow senators. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=601.48s)]
*  He didn't say a word. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=605.64s)]
*  How pathetic is that? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=609.36s)]
*  How cowardly is that? [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=610.36s)]
*  You know, like you run for the Senate, you're a career politician. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=613.6s)]
*  You're like old, you're in like your 23rd term or whatever. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=617.88s)]
*  Who cares? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=620.6800000000001s)]
*  Like you don't have any sense of like duty at all. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=621.6800000000001s)]
*  Like I don't want to be naive. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=626.0s)]
*  I get that these are scummy politicians, very conniving. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=627.8000000000001s)]
*  The more they stay around Washington, probably the less principled, the fewer principles they [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=631.36s)]
*  believe they can operate on, the more kind of just pragmatic and cunning or whatever [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=635.64s)]
*  they become. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=640.8000000000001s)]
*  But you're talking here about the most serious war that the United States has fought since [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=643.8000000000001s)]
*  at least Vietnam. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=648.76s)]
*  And you have the evidence in your hands that the government is lying yet again, like they [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=652.48s)]
*  did with the Vietnam war and the Gulf of Tonkin. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=656.28s)]
*  And you just sit and say nothing? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=659.24s)]
*  Now I've seen this many times before and I'm going to get to that, but there's a counter [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=666.0400000000001s)]
*  example. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=669.8s)]
*  When Daniel Ellsberg discovered the Pentagon Papers in the 1960s, the late 1960s, and the [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=672.12s)]
*  Pentagon Papers were a multi-volume, tens of thousands of pages account compiled by [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=680.24s)]
*  the Pentagon and the Ram Corporation to give policymakers in the Pentagon and the White [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=687.72s)]
*  House a true picture of the war in Vietnam. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=693.68s)]
*  And the Pentagon Papers concluded, and members of the highest levels of the government also [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=698.28s)]
*  knew under Lyndon Johnson and then Richard Nixon, that there was no way the US could [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=703.56s)]
*  win the war in Vietnam. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=709.12s)]
*  At most they could fight to a standstill. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=710.48s)]
*  And yet they were constantly telling the public that was growing tired of this war, like, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=714.0s)]
*  hey, we're losing all our young people, our young men who are being drafted, we're killing [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=716.76s)]
*  huge numbers of people, we're spending tons of money, there's social unrest. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=723.1999999999999s)]
*  What is going on? [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=727.2s)]
*  So the Pentagon would say, oh, don't worry, we're close to winning. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=728.2s)]
*  We're like six months away from winning. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=730.8000000000001s)]
*  We're making immense progress. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=732.36s)]
*  Inside though, in the Pentagon Papers, they were saying the exact opposite. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=734.04s)]
*  They knew they couldn't win. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=737.36s)]
*  So it's the same thing. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=738.36s)]
*  Daniel Ellsberg had proof in his hands that the American government was lying to the people [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=739.72s)]
*  about the Vietnam War. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=744.2s)]
*  And Ellsberg had a very high position in the government. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=747.08s)]
*  He had a PhD from Harvard in nuclear policy. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=750.2s)]
*  He worked at the highest levels of the Rand Corporation, had some of the most, some of [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=753.2s)]
*  the most, the access to the most sensitive documents inside the government. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=759.84s)]
*  And he did what Patrick Leahy wouldn't do, which is he's like, I got to get this to the [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=765.84s)]
*  public, even though I'm probably going to go to jail for life. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=769.1600000000001s)]
*  He didn't have, he wasn't a senator. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=771.8000000000001s)]
*  He didn't have any sort of parliamentary immunity. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=772.8000000000001s)]
*  And then he tried to get members of Congress to read it on the floor. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=778.98s)]
*  And when he couldn't, he went to the New York Times, the Washington Post, and they published [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=783.14s)]
*  parts of it. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=785.94s)]
*  But then finally he found Senator Mike Ravel, a Republican from Alaska, who was like, no, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=786.94s)]
*  you know what? [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=792.38s)]
*  I have parliamentary immunity and this is what it's for. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=794.54s)]
*  The public has a right to know that the American people are lying to the public. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=796.66s)]
*  Now, by the way, Daniel Ellsberg was charged with espionage. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=800.02s)]
*  They tried to imprison him for life. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=802.22s)]
*  And the only reason why his case was dismissed was because the Nixon administration was [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=804.7s)]
*  discovered to have burglarized the office of his psychoanalyst to try and find dirt [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=808.62s)]
*  on the private life of Daniel Ellsberg. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=814.74s)]
*  And the judge, because of that misconduct, dismissed the case. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=816.94s)]
*  But had he not done, had the judge not done so, Daniel Ellsberg probably would have been [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=819.76s)]
*  in prison for the rest of his life. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=823.6s)]
*  He just died about 18 months ago at the age of 94. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=824.94s)]
*  I had the honor of working with him when we created the Freedom of the Press Foundation [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=827.74s)]
*  together. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=831.9s)]
*  He was unbelievably smart, like one of the smartest people I ever met. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=832.9s)]
*  And even at like 91 or 92, he would attend these board meetings we had at the Freedom [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=837.3399999999999s)]
*  of the Press Foundation. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=840.66s)]
*  He would just present like the most complex arguments possible. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=841.66s)]
*  So he got Senator Gravel to read it from the floor of the Senate. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=847.0999999999999s)]
*  And this is what that kind of bravery looks like. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=851.74s)]
*  Mr. President, Mr. Congressman, there is no doubt that people must know the full story [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=855.5799999999999s)]
*  of what has occurred over the past 20 years within their government. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=866.78s)]
*  The story is a terrible one. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=874.86s)]
*  It is replete with duplicity, connivance against the public and public officials. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=877.38s)]
*  I know of nothing in our history to equal it for extent of failure and extent of loss [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=886.42s)]
*  in all aspects of the term. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=894.0200000000001s)]
*  We can equal. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=897.46s)]
*  Human beings are being killed as I speak to you tonight. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=900.74s)]
*  Killed as a direct result of policy decisions we as a body have made. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=909.1800000000001s)]
*  Arms. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=916.86s)]
*  Arms are being severed. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=920.74s)]
*  Metal is crashing through human bodies because of a public policy. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=923.46s)]
*  This government. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=932.46s)]
*  We made such a sacrifice to preserve freedom and liberty in Southeast Asia. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=983.46s)]
*  One may respond that we sacrifice ourselves on the continent of Asia so that we will not [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=993.38s)]
*  have to fight a similar war on the shores of America. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1004.22s)]
*  One can make these arguments only if he has failed to read the Pentagon Papers. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1008.58s)]
*  So that was the prelude to him then reading the Pentagon Papers into the record and you [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1017.26s)]
*  can be uncomfortable with or even mock if you want the very emotional display of Senator [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1020.7s)]
*  Gravel there. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1028.42s)]
*  in the middle of that statement but I would suggest that that is a far more admirable [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1031.14s)]
*  and noble and understandable reaction than what Senator Leahy did. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1039.42s)]
*  I mean every day if you're a senator in the late 1960s or late 1970s you're getting intelligence [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1047.5400000000002s)]
*  briefings on how unbelievably horrific the Vietnam War is. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1052.94s)]
*  58,000 Americans killed, 2 million Vietnamese at least killed. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1056.98s)]
*  I mean just the use of biological agents like Agent Orange. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1063.22s)]
*  It was a brutal savage barbaric war and the people who were in there in the middle of [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1068.66s)]
*  the jungles and rivers of Vietnam had no idea why they were fighting there, why they were [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1074.66s)]
*  being killed on the other side of the world. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1079.78s)]
*  So if you're aware of information that the public can perhaps use to understand they're [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1083.78s)]
*  being lied to and hopefully stop the war I think it's absolutely commendable to think [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1091.46s)]
*  about what's happening to human beings. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1097.94s)]
*  I mean that's a humanistic response. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1099.5800000000002s)]
*  But he didn't just cry about it, he actually tried to do something about it. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1102.5400000000002s)]
*  Even though they have parliamentary immunity, reading top secret Pentagon documents about [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1107.18s)]
*  a war in the middle of Washington D.C. you would never know for certain that that's going [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1112.54s)]
*  to be honored. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1119.06s)]
*  In fact here in Brazil there's a, just quickly, there's a very similar parliamentary immunity [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1120.06s)]
*  privilege that people in Congress and the Senate enjoy. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1125.06s)]
*  And a couple months ago a member of Congress went to the microphone to speak at the tribunal [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1128.18s)]
*  where he heavily criticized the authoritarian chief judge of the Supreme Court even though [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1134.98s)]
*  he's not technically the chief judge, he's in fact facts that way, Alexandre de Marais. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1140.8999999999999s)]
*  And then shortly after Alexandre de Marais ordered the police to investigate him and [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1144.9399999999998s)]
*  to try and convict him for having spoken there. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1148.1399999999999s)]
*  And their argument was, yeah they have parliamentary immunity but it's not absolute. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1151.6999999999998s)]
*  But you can have it as long as you don't criticize this authoritarian judge. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1156.1399999999999s)]
*  So I wouldn't be 100% sure at all that if I read top secret military documents in the [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1161.4799999999998s)]
*  middle of a war, it can be considered treason, but Mike Ravel went and did it anyway, that's [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1166.4199999999998s)]
*  what courage is. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1171.9399999999998s)]
*  In contrast to Pat Leahy, there's another case that I'm very familiar with that I've [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1174.34s)]
*  had personal dealings with that to this day sickens me that I just want to tell you about. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1177.3s)]
*  So for about two or three years before the Snowden reporting started, before Edward Snowden [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1182.6599999999999s)]
*  risked his liberty to come forward and show his fellow citizens the truth about how the [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1190.6599999999999s)]
*  government was spying on them with no limits and no warrants and risking his life in prison [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1196.46s)]
*  to do it. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1201.7s)]
*  And he didn't go to prison but that's only because he's in exile and asylum in Russia [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1202.7s)]
*  for the last 12 years with no end in sight. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1208.26s)]
*  So he paid a price but it was a courageous thing to do. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1212.44s)]
*  But two different senators, Ron Wyden and Mark Udall, Ron Wyden of Oregon, Mark Udall [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1214.82s)]
*  of Utah, went around like hinting that, oh, the NSA is doing some really bad stuff that [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1220.38s)]
*  the American public, if they knew about, would be angered by, would be enraged by, but they [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1228.78s)]
*  never said what it was. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1234.94s)]
*  They could have done what Senator Ravel did and gone to the fore, but no, they just kept [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1236.7s)]
*  like hinting, they would write emails, like in interviews they would go over and write [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1239.78s)]
*  up ads saying, oh, if you only knew how they were interpreting the Patriot Act and what [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1243.26s)]
*  they were allowing the NSA to do, you would be enraged, but they didn't have the courage [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1247.1s)]
*  to say it. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1250.62s)]
*  And it was only once Snowden came forward and we started publishing reporting about [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1253.02s)]
*  what the NSA was doing based on his courageous act, did they start coming forward and say [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1257.6999999999998s)]
*  things like this from the Washington Post July 28, 2013, the headline of the Post, with [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1262.1999999999998s)]
*  NSA revelations, meaning the Snowden reporting, Senator Ron Wyden's vague privacy warnings [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1268.2199999999998s)]
*  finally become clear. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1274.38s)]
*  Exactly, he was dropping little hints. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1276.8200000000002s)]
*  And he could have just set it on the Senate floor with immunity, but he waited for Snowden [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1281.42s)]
*  to come forward and do it even though he had no immunity. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1284.74s)]
*  Think about how cowardly that is. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1287.7800000000002s)]
*  Here's Wyden in 2011, May of 2011, so basically two years before we started the Snowden reporting [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1290.2600000000002s)]
*  on the Senate floor, dropping his little hints. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1298.66s)]
*  You go into the Intelligence Committee several times a week, as Senator Udall and I do, you [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1303.14s)]
*  come away with the indisputable judgment that there are threats to the well-being of this [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1308.5400000000002s)]
*  country, that there are people who do not wish our citizens well. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1315.1000000000001s)]
*  So in these dangerous times, the sources and methods of our anti-terror operations absolutely [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1320.74s)]
*  must be kept secret. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1330.3000000000002s)]
*  That is fundamental to the work of the Intelligence Community, keeping the sources and methods [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1332.94s)]
*  of those who serve us so gallantly secret and ensure that they are as safe as possible. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1339.46s)]
*  But while we protect those sources and methods, the laws that authorize them should not be [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1347.72s)]
*  kept secret from the American people. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1355.18s)]
*  Yes, we need secret operations, but secret law is bad for our democracy. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1357.62s)]
*  It will undermine the confidence that the American people have in our intelligence operations. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1364.6999999999998s)]
*  God, that is so inspiring. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1370.1399999999999s)]
*  You have no idea how much that makes me well up with pride at our leaders. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1372.58s)]
*  He's like, secret laws, meaning like the way they interpreted the Patriot Act to allow [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1378.78s)]
*  the NSA to spy on all Americans without warrant, saying secret laws are dangerous. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1382.78s)]
*  We can't have these. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1386.9s)]
*  We have secret laws. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1387.9s)]
*  And you know who knew what those secret laws were? [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1388.9s)]
*  Ron Wyden. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1391.46s)]
*  He's like, it's so dangerous to have secret laws. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1392.46s)]
*  Then why don't you disclose what was being done? [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1394.7800000000002s)]
*  He's saying like sources and methods have to be protected. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1398.46s)]
*  Like you don't disclose the names of people in foreign countries who collaborate with [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1400.5s)]
*  the United States government because that could get them killed. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1406.02s)]
*  Fine. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1408.66s)]
*  And methods, okay, you don't disclose the blueprints of like the technology used to [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1409.66s)]
*  surveil because another country might copy them or learn how to debate them. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1413.66s)]
*  Fine. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1418.66s)]
*  But he's saying what you can't have is secret law where the government is spying on American [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1419.66s)]
*  citizens based on radical interpretations of the law because that's very dangerous. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1423.66s)]
*  But you know who helped keep those laws, those secret laws, a secret? [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1428.94s)]
*  Ron Wyden because he was too afraid to do what Mike Gravel did. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1431.7s)]
*  He was like Pat Leahy. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1435.3400000000001s)]
*  He was in possession of extremely relevant, important information that the U.S. government, [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1437.14s)]
*  that the American people had the right to have, but he was too afraid, even though he's [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1442.1s)]
*  speaking on the Senate floor right there with immunity, to actually say what it is. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1444.9s)]
*  March 15, 2012, about nine months before Snowden first contacted me, about a year before we [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1449.62s)]
*  went to Hong Kong to meet with him, both Senator Wyden and Senator Udall wrote a joint letter [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1459.62s)]
*  to then Attorney General Eric Holder and you see there it's on the U.S. Senate letterhead, [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1467.86s)]
*  very, very official, very official, very elegant, very historic calligraphy and they said, [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1474.1799999999998s)]
*  quote, we have discussed the dangers of relying on secret interpretations of public law with [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1482.1799999999998s)]
*  you on multiple occasions, but through correspondence and both through correspondence and in person. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1488.26s)]
*  While we know that you are generally aware of our views on the subject, we feel obliged [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1493.58s)]
*  to comment specifically on the Justice Department's recent attempt to seek dismissal of two lawsuits [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1497.42s)]
*  that have been filed on the Freedom of Information Act and that specifically pertains to this [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1502.6200000000001s)]
*  problem of secret law. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1506.54s)]
*  We believe most Americans would be stunned to learn. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1507.7s)]
*  We believe that we believe most Americans would be stunned to learn, stunned. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1512.1000000000001s)]
*  They would be stunned if they knew. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1522.66s)]
*  The details of how these secret court opinions have interpreted section two, sit 15 of the [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1525.0s)]
*  Patriot Act, as we see it, there is now a significant gap between what most Americans [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1530.56s)]
*  believe the law allows and what the government secretly claims the law allows. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1535.88s)]
*  This is a problem because it is impossible to have an informed public debate about what [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1540.68s)]
*  the law should say and what the public doesn't know what its government thinks the law says. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1545.4s)]
*  You see this posturing, this cowardly, disgusting posturing? [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1551.52s)]
*  People have the right to know what our government is doing when interpreting the Patriot Act [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1556.96s)]
*  and what they're arguing it allows them to do when spying on American citizens, but they [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1562.32s)]
*  never have the courage, despite how dangerous they said it was, despite how toxic to democracy [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1565.8799999999999s)]
*  they said it was, despite how it robs people of the right of consent in a democracy. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1570.08s)]
*  Americans never learned about this and never would have had it not been for the fact that [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1580.04s)]
*  Edward Snowden, seeing that senators were too scared to reveal it, seeing that when [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1584.1s)]
*  James Clapper, the senior intelligence official, the director of national intelligence for [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1592.48s)]
*  Obama went before the Senate and Ron Wyden asked him trying to get Clapper to have to [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1597.2s)]
*  admit it, are you collecting huge dossiers on American citizens? [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1603.3999999999999s)]
*  Seeing that James Clapper lied and said no sir, not wittingly, and Ron Wyden didn't [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1607.4s)]
*  say anything, didn't say you're lying, Snowden had the proof in his hand that he was lying. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1611.16s)]
*  It was like if I don't come forward, no one's going to know. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1615.52s)]
*  And he came forward knowing you'd probably go to prison for life and that's what led [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1620.52s)]
*  to this article, which was the first one we published from the Snowden file on June 6, [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1623.96s)]
*  2013, the headline which says NSA collecting phone records of millions of Verizon customers, [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1630.92s)]
*  top secret court order requiring Verizon to hand over all call data shows the scale of [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1637.92s)]
*  domestic surveillance under Obama. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1642.72s)]
*  And for those who don't recall, that was a court order issued in secret by a secret FISA [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1646.0s)]
*  court ordering all telephone carriers, we had the Verizon one, but it was all telephone [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1649.52s)]
*  carriers to just turn over to the government en masse all the call records of every American [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1654.38s)]
*  citizen, who you call, where you were when you called, how long the call was, and who [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1659.1200000000001s)]
*  you called. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1664.96s)]
*  You can put together a massive dossier of someone's life by knowing that information, [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1665.96s)]
*  that's what the secret law, the secret court claimed the Patriot Act allowed. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1671.6000000000001s)]
*  Now get this, on the day that we published the first article, June 6, Mark Udall went [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1677.92s)]
*  to the Washington Post and said, look at this headline, Mark Udall, I tried to expose this [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1684.92s)]
*  NSA program. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1691.44s)]
*  What was stopping him? [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1694.68s)]
*  It was Snowden came forward and he's like, yeah, that was what I meant, that I tried [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1696.92s)]
*  to expose it too. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1699.6000000000001s)]
*  What did you do to expose it? [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1702.3200000000002s)]
*  You were too afraid to do anything. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1703.52s)]
*  Quote, Senator Mark Udall, Democrat of Colorado, that's right, I said Utah earlier, it's Colorado, [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1705.16s)]
*  said he, quote, did everything short of leaking classified information to bring attention [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1709.96s)]
*  to the NSA seizure of American phone records, quote, I did everything in my power to bring [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1714.0s)]
*  attention to the program, he told the Denver Post. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1718.2s)]
*  He had it in his power to do what Snowden did, to do what we reported. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1722.94s)]
*  He was too much of a coward to do it. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1727.8200000000002s)]
*  Here's Mark Udall, also in 2011, posturing as being so enraged and indignant about what [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1732.38s)]
*  the government was doing in secret, how they were interpreting the Patriot Act to go way [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1741.6200000000001s)]
*  the author of the Patriot Act said anyone imagined it would be used for. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1746.34s)]
*  And he too dropped these little crumbs, these little hints, you know, like you're kind of [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1753.62s)]
*  playing like charades, you give like little hints but you're not allowed to say the answer [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1756.74s)]
*  because you get disqualified, you just kind of try and provoke someone to figure it out, [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1760.74s)]
*  little like puzzle pieces. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1765.06s)]
*  Listen to this. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1768.1s)]
*  And indeed, many of the Patriot Act's provisions, which I support, have made our nation safer [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1771.42s)]
*  since those devastating attacks on that day, we'll always remember on 9-11. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1779.22s)]
*  We know that for a fact. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1784.3000000000002s)]
*  But the problem we confront today is that there are three provisions that we're debating [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1786.7s)]
*  that fail to strike the right balance between keeping us safe while protecting the privacy [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1791.38s)]
*  rights of Coloradans and all Americans. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1796.0600000000002s)]
*  Instead, these three provisions are far too susceptible to abuse by the federal government, [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1799.8999999999999s)]
*  even in the name of keeping us safe from terrorism. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1804.86s)]
*  I don't say this lightly, but my concerns about some of these provisions have only grown [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1807.26s)]
*  since I've been briefed on their interpretation and their implementation as a member of the [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1812.86s)]
*  Intelligence Committee. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1817.5s)]
*  Let me share some examples. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1819.98s)]
*  Currently the Intelligence Community can place wide-ranging wiretaps on Americans without [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1822.6999999999998s)]
*  even identifying the target or the location of such surveillance. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1827.66s)]
*  That's one concern. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1832.78s)]
*  The second concern, the Intelligence Community can target individuals who have no connection [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1833.78s)]
*  to terrorist organizations. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1838.38s)]
*  And a third concern that I have is they can collect business records on law-abiding Americans [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1841.22s)]
*  who have no connection to terrorism. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1845.74s)]
*  We ought to be able to at least agree that the source of an investigation under the Patriot [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1849.3400000000001s)]
*  Act should have a terrorist-related focus. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1854.58s)]
*  If we can't limit investigations to terrorism, my concern is where do they end? [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1859.82s)]
*  Is there no amount of information that our government can collect that should be off [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1865.98s)]
*  limits? [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1870.1s)]
*  I know Coloradans are demanding that we at least place common-sense limits on government [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1872.1s)]
*  investigations and link data collection to terrorist-related activities. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1877.78s)]
*  If we pass this bill, Mr. President, to extend the Patriot Act until 2015, it would mean [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1883.98s)]
*  that for four more years the federal government will continue to have unrestrained access [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1888.54s)]
*  to private information about Americans who have no connection to terrorism with little [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1893.74s)]
*  to no accountability as to how these powers are used. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1898.5s)]
*  I mean, you know what? [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1901.6200000000001s)]
*  I reported on this topic for three years. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1902.94s)]
*  It was a very important part of my career. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1906.22s)]
*  I still pay very close attention to this violence debate. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1907.38s)]
*  I could barely get through that. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1909.3400000000001s)]
*  It was so ambiguous, so bereft of anything substantive that you could really understand [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1911.02s)]
*  what the government was doing because he too was just a coward. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1917.82s)]
*  And then the minute we came out with that report, he's like, I tried everything. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1922.18s)]
*  Yeah, everything except disclosing what you could have disclosed to let the American [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1925.38s)]
*  people know way before Edward Snowden came forward so that he didn't have to spend his [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1929.9s)]
*  life in prison or in Russia. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1933.5s)]
*  So I think that's, I mean, it is very fascinating the way the intelligence community works. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1938.3s)]
*  They just jog up behind Leahy with his wife. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1943.22s)]
*  They're like, hey, look at file 8. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1946.3s)]
*  Bye. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1949.3s)]
*  And then they come back a few days later, they're like, hey, we already looked at file [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1950.58s)]
*  8. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1953.3799999999999s)]
*  That's great. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1954.3799999999999s)]
*  Look at file 12. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1955.3799999999999s)]
*  That's very interesting. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1956.3799999999999s)]
*  People in the government, in the intelligence community were trying to alert the public [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1957.3799999999999s)]
*  through Leahy that this proof existed, but he was too much of a coward to do anything [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1960.18s)]
*  about it. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1968.02s)]
*  And so were senators Wyden and Udall, whereas Senator Gravel wasn't. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1969.02s)]
*  I just want to say the final thing. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1975.62s)]
*  When Edward Snowden did their jobs for them, when he said, I'm not too afraid to come forward, [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1978.26s)]
*  I'd rather someone in the Senate do it, but they clearly won't. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1985.06s)]
*  So I guess I have to. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1989.3799999999999s)]
*  And he comes forward and doesn't dump it all on the internet, is as careful as he can be. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1993.14s)]
*  He gives it to journalists with very conservative instructions about only use this very carefully. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=1998.46s)]
*  Don't put anybody in danger. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=2003.5800000000002s)]
*  Only use it to reveal to the public what they should know. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=2004.74s)]
*  And then he, of course, gets immediately indicted on multiple felony charges, including the [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=2010.26s)]
*  Espionage Act that would send him to prison for the rest of his life. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=2013.26s)]
*  They would ask Senator Wyden and Senator Udall, well, he revealed what you said. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=2016.94s)]
*  You said it should have been revealed. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=2022.06s)]
*  What do you think of him? [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=2023.46s)]
*  Are you defending him? [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=2024.46s)]
*  Do you think the prosecution would be dropped? [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=2025.46s)]
*  And they'd be like, I'm not really going to talk about Snowden. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=2027.06s)]
*  I mean, he disclosed classified information. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=2029.6599999999999s)]
*  You can't have that. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=2032.26s)]
*  Basically not only unwilling to defend him, but basically calling him a criminal for doing [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=2034.54s)]
*  what he did only because they were too afraid to. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=2039.3s)]
*  These people are propellant. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=2043.86s)]
*  rather than step forward and confront any sort of risk or warrantless unconstitutional [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=2047.82s)]
*  leave dropping as the courts ruled on American citizens with no warrants. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=2054.1s)]
*  That's the kind of people that, unfortunately, with some exceptions, but very few, get to [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haBxY-7VsXs&t=2058.8199999999997s)]
