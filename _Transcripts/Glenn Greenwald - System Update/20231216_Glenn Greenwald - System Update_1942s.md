# "Neoliberalism has failed!" Tucker Carlson on Global Populism, Censorship, Ukraine, & More
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [December 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs)
*  Talk great. It's great to see you. I was just talking to my colleagues here about the fact [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=0.0s)]
*  that I had to spend years enduring your harassing me and hectoring me and coercing me to go [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=11.56s)]
*  on your show all those times. And I finally now have a show where I get to turn the tables [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=16.52s)]
*  and do the same to you. I love it. But yeah, I'm really delighted to commemorate our year [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=20.16s)]
*  on the air and to under show by speaking with you. I'm really looking forward to it. Thanks [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=26.14s)]
*  for taking the time to do it. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=30.54s)]
*  Well, it's so funny. I woke up thinking about you so weirdly have nothing to do with this, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=33.54s)]
*  but I was the world has gotten so dark. I literally thought of you within four minutes [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=37.38s)]
*  of waking this morning and I thought trying to count my blessings. And one of them is [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=41.06s)]
*  everyone's gone so insane. I've lost, you know, most of my friends, but I've really [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=45.38s)]
*  become close to all these remarkable people I never would have been close to otherwise. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=50.260000000000005s)]
*  And you're way up on that list. So thank you. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=54.78s)]
*  Yeah, I feel the same. We used to joke all the time about how as recently as 2015, if [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=57.82s)]
*  anyone had said we'd be doing anything like this, we would have told everybody that you're [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=63.02s)]
*  crazy. That's Tucker Carlson. That's going great. And yet here we are. It's the nature [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=66.66s)]
*  of the world. All right, let me begin. I obviously want to talk to you about this exciting new [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=71.34s)]
*  venture that you announced and I'm excited by it and I'm excited to hear a lot about [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=75.9s)]
*  it. Before we get to that, though, I just want to talk about the context a little bit [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=79.78s)]
*  of where this is going and kind of the what caused you to create this. And I want to start [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=83.46s)]
*  by asking the following, which is I know when I left the Intercept where if you had asked [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=89.58s)]
*  me the whole time up until the day I left, am I free to say whatever I wanted? I would [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=94.69999999999999s)]
*  have said, yeah, absolutely. Nobody ever tells me what to say. Nobody could tell me what [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=100.1s)]
*  to say. I'm totally free. And yet once I left, I felt this liberation that I feel until this [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=103.33999999999999s)]
*  very day. Like, obviously, there were all these ways I was constrained subliminally [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=108.88s)]
*  in ways that I didn't really realize. I definitely see this in you too. And the way that you [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=114.72s)]
*  speak about things and how you speak about them, you just seem happier personally, but [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  also in your work. I'm wondering if you found that, that you feel liberated, even though [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=123.28s)]
*  I know at Fox people weren't telling you what to say. But were there chains that were on [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=128.7s)]
*  you that you didn't really realize? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=133.3s)]
*  So smart and only someone who's experienced it would know that. And you're absolutely [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=137.12s)]
*  right. Sulzhenitsyn writes about this, that one of the costs of an authoritarian structure [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=141.56s)]
*  is what it does to the way you think and the way you permit yourself to think. And that [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=146.48s)]
*  is absolutely what happened to me. And I would always brag about the arrangement I had on [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=150.16s)]
*  Fox, which was real, which I said, you know, it's your channel. If you don't like it, what [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=153.48s)]
*  I'm saying, pull me off. But you can't control what I say while I'm on the air. And they [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=157.84s)]
*  live by that. But I never and I always think of myself as a strong person and a free man. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=161.82s)]
*  I'm gonna say what I think. And to a large extent I did. But I never appreciated how [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=166.48s)]
*  that affected the way I allowed myself to think. And the second I left and what a blessing [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=172.2s)]
*  that was, and of course, most of your blessings come in disguise. You don't realize what they [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=178.56s)]
*  are for the, you know, when they happen. But that really was a huge blessing for me. And [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=183.0s)]
*  yes, I mean, there were all sorts of things. I mean, for one thing, just the structure [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=186.83999999999997s)]
*  of television, not just the company I work for, but all of them is inherently partisan. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=191.01999999999998s)]
*  And I'm just not partisan. I never have been partisan. I've never been fully unborn. I [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=196.3s)]
*  don't like the Democratic Party. I'm happy to say that. But I've never been for the Republican [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=200.42000000000002s)]
*  Party, especially because I don't think they're sincere. I don't think they mean it. I don't [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=205.38000000000002s)]
*  believe anything, most of them. And yet the structure of cable television is inherently [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=207.98000000000002s)]
*  partisan. You kind of can't kind of get out of that. And so I'm happy to say almost all [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=214.38000000000002s)]
*  Democrats are bad. But I am not happy to say and I wouldn't be honest if I said most Republicans [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=219.04000000000002s)]
*  are good officeholders because that's not true. They're not good. So that really, I [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=223.62s)]
*  felt a lot freer to express that and to really think about it more deeply. There's no reason [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=229.46s)]
*  that I would have any loyalty to say that the new Speaker of the House, who's literally [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=234.54s)]
*  first public statement after getting that job, third in line for the presidency, was [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=239.5s)]
*  to announce his concern for other countries at a time when our country is really degrading [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=243.46s)]
*  in a scary way. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=247.82s)]
*  Yeah, I know. He ascended that tribune and he said, the first thing we're going to do, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=249.01999999999998s)]
*  all of America was listening, what are you going to do? Are you going to re-industrialize [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=254.29999999999998s)]
*  the Midwest? Are you going to do something about the fentanyl crisis ravaging our communities? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=257.42s)]
*  He said the first thing we're going to do is get a bill passed for our friend Israel. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=261.34s)]
*  That was the first thing he told Americans we were going to do is something for a foreign [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=265.32s)]
*  country. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=268.38s)]
*  Well, exactly. And it's hardly an attack on Israel to be offended by that if you're an [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=269.38s)]
*  which I am, born here. So I thought that was outrageous. And I always would have thought [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=276.54s)]
*  it was outrageous, but I would have thought to myself, well, you know, he's better than [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=281.98s)]
*  the other guy or whatever. Now I just feel like, I don't know, it's outrageous. I mean, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=285.90000000000003s)]
*  it doesn't mean he's going to hell or he's a terrible person. That's not up to me to [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=290.38s)]
*  judge, but it means that statement betrays a mindset that is repugnant to me and I feel [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=293.86s)]
*  totally free to say so, etc. So it's not so much what I was allowed to think. It's the [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=299.72s)]
*  way that you think is is heavily influenced by the structure that you live in. And I'm [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=305.42s)]
*  glad to be out of that structure. I will say exactly. I want to ask you now that you're [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=311.86s)]
*  really fully fledged member of the inter the independent media. Welcome to the independent [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=316.14s)]
*  media. I mean, you already were that with your show on Twitter, but now you're really [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=321.38s)]
*  all in and tough. Yeah. And you know, as somebody who's really been, you know, kind of thinking [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=326.1s)]
*  about this a lot over the past few years, I think one of the really interesting things [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=331.1s)]
*  too is just the nature, the structure of how discourse has to happen on television. And [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=335.42s)]
*  actually the best person who's talked about this is no Chomsky, who obviously lots of [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=340.34000000000003s)]
*  people have disagreements with in a lot of other ways. Nonetheless, one of the things [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=344.02000000000004s)]
*  he once said that I found so insightful is that on television you have the requirement [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=347.34000000000003s)]
*  of concision, meaning you have to make your points in seven minutes in between commercial [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=352.86s)]
*  breaks or sometimes you could do 15 or 17 minutes with your monologue. But still there [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=358.58000000000004s)]
*  is a concision requirement. And what he said was that in it inherently serves establishment [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=363.3s)]
*  orthodoxy, because if you want to go on TV and say something that most people already [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=370.3s)]
*  think like, Oh, Iran is really evil and Russia is terrible and China's repressive, you don't [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=373.18s)]
*  really need much time. People already think that you just take a few minutes. You say [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=379.26000000000005s)]
*  everyone nods their head. But if you want to really dig in and like challenge establishment [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=382.38s)]
*  orthodoxy in a fundamental way to say, well, what about our own government and what are [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=387.1s)]
*  the or whatever else it is that you want to do, you need time to do it. You don't have [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=391.18s)]
*  that time when you have to speak in between these commercial breaks using the attribute [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=395.3s)]
*  of concision. You did have that longer form show, but it was on your streaming service. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=400.88s)]
*  I did it once and I did think it enabled a different kind of conversation. But is that [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=406.5s)]
*  something as well that looking back, do you think constrained you and what you could do? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=409.86s)]
*  Hugely, hugely. And it's one of the reasons that I got out of debating on TV, which I [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=413.86s)]
*  always really enjoyed. I mean, the real reason I got out was the DNC boycotted me. And so [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=421.54s)]
*  no democratic member could come on. But after a couple years of not doing those debates, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=426.42s)]
*  which had been kind of my bread and butter for 25 years on TV, I realized how unhelpful [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=430.98s)]
*  they are, not just because they're contentious, there's nothing wrong with a contentious conversation. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=436.26s)]
*  You need more. But because they were, they pushed each person into a box that you kind [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=440.22s)]
*  of couldn't get out of. And that form was a lot of the reason for it. So I got away, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=447.54s)]
*  you know, my out was writing myself like a long form 12 minute open every night where [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=454.58000000000004s)]
*  I could just think about it and really say what I wanted to say. But that's that's a [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=460.3s)]
*  soliloquy, not a colloquy. So I did miss the conversation. And, you know, I don't drive [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=464.62s)]
*  very much. And when I do, I just listen to bluegrass music and space out. So I've never [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=470.1s)]
*  really listened to podcasts in my whole life. And I've done a lot of them now in the past [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=474.74s)]
*  seven months about a lot of podcasts. What an amazing form that is just the structure [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=478.62s)]
*  is amazing, because of the lack of time limits and the conversational nature of it. And it [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=483.3s)]
*  just becomes like this incredible experience is like the best dinner party you've ever [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=488.5s)]
*  been to kind of thing. And I just absolutely loved it. And I can see why. And I'm sure [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=492.82000000000005s)]
*  you have the same experience like the people in my world, you know, the smart people who [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=497.78s)]
*  are really interested in what's going on and sincerely trying to figure out what's true. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=501.82s)]
*  A lot of them listen to podcasts a lot. And I thought that was weird. But now I understand [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=505.7s)]
*  why. And so the fact that podcasts in long form independent media are replacing, say, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=510.29999999999995s)]
*  NBC News, which will not exist in 10 years, like no chance. That's a good thing. That's [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=516.02s)]
*  a cause for hope. We should be happy, I think. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=520.4599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you know, it's funny. I think the first time I was on your show, or one of the first [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=522.62s)]
*  times I was on your Fox show, the segment before me, you were interviewing Adam Schiff [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=527.02s)]
*  about Russiagate. And I remember it so well, because all you were doing was saying, hey, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=530.9399999999999s)]
*  you keep asserting these things that the FBI and the CIA leaked to the Washington Post [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=536.2199999999999s)]
*  and the New York Times, but there's actually no evidence for it. Do you have evidence for [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=539.4599999999999s)]
*  it? And his response was, sounds like you should put your show on RT. And I know at [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=543.0999999999999s)]
*  some point, you kind of lost the ability to interview Adam Schiff, because Democrats wouldn't [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=548.18s)]
*  go on your show. We find the same thing. We've had a lot of members of Congress from the [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=552.66s)]
*  Republican Party on this show. Democratic members of Congress keep saying maybe they [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=556.52s)]
*  will, but most will never come on our show. And so you do have that ability to have this [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=560.68s)]
*  long-form discourse where you can deconstruct people's ideas, even though they may not [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=565.3199999999999s)]
*  be here for you to confront it. Let me ask you about the cancellation of your show by [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=569.6s)]
*  Fox, because I know you've been asked this before. Yes. And I've heard you say, look, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=574.1999999999999s)]
*  I don't know. They didn't give me a reason. I don't know for sure why. And I know that's [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=578.48s)]
*  true. But one of the things we do know for sure is that when your show is canceled, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=583.72s)]
*  there were a bunch of Republicans in Congress in the most cowardly way possible, which is [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=589.5600000000001s)]
*  their nature, who ran to places like Politico and other outlets to say, we're so happy he's [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=593.44s)]
*  off the air because his opposition to the war in Ukraine made it so much harder for [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=599.5400000000001s)]
*  us to fund the war in Ukraine because a lot of our voters were asking, why are you funding [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=604.0s)]
*  this war on the other side of the world when there's so many problems at home? We also [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=607.96s)]
*  know that by canceling your show, it basically removed the most vocal opponent of the top [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=611.84s)]
*  priority of the U.S. security state, which is the war in Ukraine. It left a couple of [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=618.56s)]
*  people kind of question it, but nowhere near to the extent and with the dedication that [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=621.92s)]
*  you were doing. Do you have any doubts, even though there may be other reasons? I mean, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=625.96s)]
*  you obviously it wasn't because of your ratings. You didn't have a scandal that brought down [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=631.24s)]
*  other Fox hosts or other people with top rated shows before you didn't have anything like [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=635.1s)]
*  that. So do you have any doubts that your vehement opposition to this war that most [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=640.72s)]
*  establishment Republicans support that the U.S. security state had as their top priority [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=645.6800000000001s)]
*  was at least a factor in why you got removed from the air? [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=649.44s)]
*  Again, I have no evidence. But as you said, I also have no doubt. I mean, the explanation [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=652.88s)]
*  that filtered out from wherever the explanations filter out was that they, you know, I was [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=659.6800000000001s)]
*  a racist. Well, I'm actually not a racist. So and everyone who knows me knows I'm not [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=663.76s)]
*  a racist. So I know it wasn't that. So it was clearly, you know, a position that I was [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=668.8s)]
*  taking of significance that was deeply unpopular in the world that the people who run these [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=676.64s)]
*  companies live in. And they're really matching a position on the Vax that they really hated. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=682.3599999999999s)]
*  But that had kind of passed. But the war in Ukraine had not passed. And in fact, it was [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=687.04s)]
*  a kind of a critical point. And and my views were really despised. And I know that because [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=690.88s)]
*  I was told that to my face, I but never asked to change them, I will say. But it was really [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=698.16s)]
*  clear, like, people don't like this at all. And but I didn't stop. And I guess I kind [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=702.4s)]
*  of have to wonder, it's not even about me. And maybe you have a good hypothesis here. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=707.92s)]
*  But like, what was that exactly? It wasn't it's not as simple as, you know, people are [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=711.92s)]
*  getting rich from the war. Of course, they're getting rich from the war. And of course, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=717.28s)]
*  the weapons manufacturers love the war. They've said so. I get it. They just met with Zelensky [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=720.4399999999999s)]
*  yesterday. But that does not explain how the entire American ruling class became emotionally [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=725.2s)]
*  involved in the fortunes of the Ukrainian government. Like, that's that's something [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=730.48s)]
*  much deeper. What was that? It was like some weird dog whistle that only sort of high income, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=734.32s)]
*  well educated people could hear. And they went all in with like religious fervor. Do you have any? [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=741.36s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, if you go back, it's so interesting. From before 2016. So before Russiagate, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=746.4000000000001s)]
*  what you had was the bipartisan political class in Washington really attacking President Obama. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=753.52s)]
*  It was one of the things on which they most attacked him. When Hillary Clinton wrote her [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=758.64s)]
*  book and had criticisms of Obama, it was almost always about the fact that he was insufficiently [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=762.24s)]
*  militaristic. He and particularly she was so angry that he wouldn't confront Russia more [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=767.04s)]
*  on Syria, on Ukraine. And when Obama gave an interview with Jeffrey Goldberg, Supreme Neocon [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=771.92s)]
*  Jeffrey Goldberg, and Jeffrey Goldberg said, Why don't you do more to confront Putin? Obama said [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=777.3599999999999s)]
*  something that if you said now you would be called a Russian agent. Look, we don't have a vital [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=782.56s)]
*  interest in confronting Russia in Syria. We don't have a vital interest in confronting Russia over [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=787.4399999999999s)]
*  Ukraine. Ukraine's not a vital interest to us. And yet you had both John McCain, but then the kind [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=792.4799999999999s)]
*  of pro-war Democrats, and led by Hillary Clinton, demanding they confront Russia. So there's been [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=796.8s)]
*  this long term attempt to seize control of Eastern Ukraine to take it away from Russia to threaten [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=801.76s)]
*  Russia in Eastern Ukraine right off the border. Victoria Nuland worked with in the Clinton State [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=807.52s)]
*  Department who she's and she's now running Ukraine as you know for Biden. But then I really think [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=812.24s)]
*  and I'm wondering if you agree that what Russiagate did and the reason I was so opposed to it for so [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=816.96s)]
*  long wasn't just because it was a fake manufactured evidence free McCarthy 8 scandal from the CIA to [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=821.76s)]
*  sabotage Trump, although it was that and that's what made it dangerous. More dangerous was the [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=827.6s)]
*  geopolitical project was to re-inject this idea into the American bloodstream, which is always kind [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=831.92s)]
*  of latent from the Cold War that our existential enemy is the Kremlin. Even though Obama was saying [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=837.28s)]
*  we can work with the Kremlin, George Bush said we can work with Putin, Bill Clinton said we can work [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=843.36s)]
*  with Putin, and yet they convinced a lot of Democrats that the reason Trump lost was because [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=847.92s)]
*  of Putin. They kept ratcheting up the hatred for Russia and I think that's why there was you combine [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=853.52s)]
*  the kind of long-standing Republican willingness to go to war against enemies, including Moscow, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=859.6s)]
*  with this newfound Democratic hatred for Russia and it served this pre-existing geopolitical agenda [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=864.56s)]
*  that where the United States wanted to control Eastern Europe, especially Ukraine, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=870.7199999999999s)]
*  and that meant undermining and challenging and weakening Russia. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=877.1999999999999s)]
*  I agree with every word of that and I remember that interview very well and I though I don't [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=882.9599999999999s)]
*  think much of Obama. I remember thinking he seemed very reasonable in it and Jeffrey Goldberg, of course, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=888.7199999999999s)]
*  one of the most sinister, dishonest people in the media in my opinion, but I remember it very well [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=893.44s)]
*  and I remember thinking, wow, they must hate him for this, but it doesn't answer the question like, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=898.1600000000001s)]
*  why would you want to be at war with Russia? What is the appeal of hating Russia? I just will speak [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=903.36s)]
*  for myself. I love Tolstoy and Dostoevsky, but that's just I like the literature of 19th century [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=909.36s)]
*  Russian novelists. I've never been there. I have no strong feelings about the country, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=915.12s)]
*  so I think I can sort of see it less emotionally than maybe some in Washington. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=918.8s)]
*  I just don't get it. It's almost like they picked it off a map, like why Russia? [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=923.4399999999999s)]
*  We won the Cold War. That's not enough. Why do we need to keep fighting them? I think it's very weird. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=927.04s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you know, if you go and I know, ironically, even though everyone knows you're [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=933.52s)]
*  an agent of the Kremlin, I've heard you say before you've never even been to the country. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=937.3599999999999s)]
*  I have a couple of times in part because my source of my friend Edward Snowden is there, but I also [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=941.8399999999999s)]
*  find it a super interesting country. It's an incredibly beautiful and cultural place, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=947.1999999999999s)]
*  St. Petersburg and Moscow. It looks a lot more like Europe than it does like Asia. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=951.4399999999999s)]
*  And Putin, for a long time, wanted a good relationship with the West. He wanted to be [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=958.24s)]
*  part of NATO, in fact, at some point. And I do think it's very strange that the United States [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=962.56s)]
*  deliberately sought out to turn Russia into an enemy. And I agree that all of the reasons [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=967.1999999999999s)]
*  aren't entirely clear. All right, let me ask you about this. One of the things that I think [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=972.88s)]
*  is so interesting that you've been doing since you left Fox is that you have been traveling [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=978.0s)]
*  around the world and not just journalistically, but almost kind of as your own political figure [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=981.2800000000001s)]
*  have been speaking to and meeting with key figures of what's called the international [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=987.44s)]
*  populist right. You already, you know, I think while you were still at Fox, you interviewed [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=992.8000000000001s)]
*  the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban twice, but since then you've, you know, you went to [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=998.08s)]
*  Brazil and interviewed the then President Jair Bolsonaro. You just were in Argentina [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1003.12s)]
*  talking to the newly elected president Javier Malé. You were just in Spain meeting with the [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1007.84s)]
*  right wing leaders of that country, the right wing opposition leaders. And if you look at all these [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1012.72s)]
*  figures, like doctrinally on foreign policy, economic policy, cultural issues even, they have [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1017.84s)]
*  a lot of differences, but I feel like there's this sort of common appeal politically, this common [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1023.68s)]
*  ethos that ties them together and permits you to kind of locate them on this coherent, [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1030.32s)]
*  as a part of a coherent political movement, the international populist right. I'm wondering if [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1036.48s)]
*  you agree with that. And if so, what do you see that's common among these figures, not necessarily [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1040.56s)]
*  in terms of their beliefs, but why they're appealing to voters? Well, I mean, I agree with [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1045.28s)]
*  the first part of your question, which is there's a lot that's different about them. I mean, to be [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1053.6s)]
*  right wing in Spain is very different from being right wing in Great Britain or anywhere else in [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1058.24s)]
*  Europe, in Portugal even, or in Hungary, or much less the United States. So, you know, there are [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1063.52s)]
*  many, many differences, but here are the things that I believe they all have in common, and not [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1068.7199999999998s)]
*  just in Europe, but in Latin America, and by the way, in the world's emerging power center, which [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1072.9599999999998s)]
*  is the Gulf. And there are these things. One, there's the recognition that the post-war order [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1079.44s)]
*  is collapsing and deserves to, because it no longer serves really anybody except a small group. Okay. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1085.2s)]
*  So it just doesn't work. These are aging institutions created to respond to threats that [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1090.72s)]
*  no longer exist, to govern a world that no longer exists. And so of course, they need to be updated. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1096.0800000000002s)]
*  One. Two, and the US is at the center of that. So we're actually going to lose in this transition, [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1102.64s)]
*  but I'm just noting this as objectively as possible. Two, neoliberalism, which really is [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1107.52s)]
*  the global religion at this point, doesn't serve the populations of these countries very well. It [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1114.0s)]
*  doesn't increase living standards or happiness. Suicide rates are way up. And as one measure of [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1119.52s)]
*  that, wages are frozen. So it doesn't actually work. So you have two options. Either you're going to [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1125.28s)]
*  just get rid of the pretense of democracy and have some kind of authoritarian system where you just [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1131.68s)]
*  force people to eat their gruel and shut up, or you change the system. So they're all very suspicious [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1136.0s)]
*  of that. And the third thing they all have in common is kind of a mild nationalism, not a scary [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1142.16s)]
*  goose-stepping nationalism, but a literal nationalism, like a belief that my country's different. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1148.24s)]
*  It may share interests with other countries, but they don't always overlap. And in the end, [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1153.2s)]
*  if I'm elected democratically to represent my citizens, I should do that. And I should be more [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1157.6s)]
*  loyal to their interests than to the interests of some international body like the UN or the World [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1162.32s)]
*  Health Organization or the WEF or whatever. I should be loyal to my country because my job is [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1167.6799999999998s)]
*  to govern my country on behalf of my country's citizens. These are very simple, moderate [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1173.04s)]
*  concepts, in my opinion. And there's nothing radical about any of that. But it's so interesting [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1178.6399999999999s)]
*  that ghouls in Washington, people who are supposed to be smart people, I'm thinking specifically of [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1184.56s)]
*  Ann Applebaum, but the entire roster at the Atlantic Magazine, who are reportedly the smartest [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1190.24s)]
*  people in our society, and spoiler alert, they're not. Actually, they're some of the least impressive [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1195.1200000000001s)]
*  people in our society. But anyway, see that as so unbelievably dangerous and scary and radical. And [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1199.68s)]
*  of course, it's the opposite of any of those things. It really reveals the radicalism and the [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1207.2s)]
*  darkness in our leadership. I mean, it kind of is a mirror holding up to the face of the State [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1213.04s)]
*  Department. And it's like, if you think it's scary for a country in a gentle way to say, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1219.2s)]
*  I'd rather make friends than I'd rather increase the living standards of my population than fund [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1223.6000000000001s)]
*  somebody else's country. If you think that's bad, then guess what? You're bad. That's my view. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1230.0800000000002s)]
*  Anyway. Yeah, I mean, it's so interesting. The Atlantic is such a perfect representation of, [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1236.48s)]
*  I think, like the rotted sickening face of the Washington establishment. I mean, for one thing, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1241.2s)]
*  it's run by Jeffrey Goldberg, who got caught spreading total conspiracy theories. He was the [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1246.08s)]
*  one who convinced Americans that Saddam Hussein had an alliance with Osama bin Laden, which led [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1250.96s)]
*  Americans to assume that we must be going to war with Iraq because Saddam Hussein planned the 9-11 [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1256.72s)]
*  attack. He won national magazine awards for that fake conspiracy theory. And then the Atlantic [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1262.6399999999999s)]
*  became ground zero for Russiagate. And you have all these people whose careers are just filled with [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1267.1999999999998s)]
*  bloodshed based on lies. But also what they have really done is in the name of claiming that Trump [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1274.96s)]
*  is this grave existential threat to democracy and to liberty, they have united the power centers, [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1284.0s)]
*  and the media has become a critical part of it, in suppressing core democratic values like free [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1289.28s)]
*  speech. They're huge advocates of censorship. They're weaponizing the justice system to try [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1295.3600000000001s)]
*  and imprison the person leading the presidential polls. They've really convinced themselves [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1299.68s)]
*  that their authoritarianism is just because they believe they're the only guardians of democracy. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1305.1200000000001s)]
*  Or do you think they really have convinced themselves of this kind of messianic mission [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1312.24s)]
*  that they're on to save democracy by becoming tyrannical because you can't trust people to [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1318.4s)]
*  know what's in their best interests, this kind of populism? Or do you think they're more consciously [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1323.1200000000001s)]
*  corrupted in what they're doing? [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1328.4s)]
*  You know, I'm in the weird position where I know them. You know, I know a lot of them personally. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1334.5600000000002s)]
*  I mean, I've had meals with them and I lived there for my whole life. So I don't know the answer [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1339.6000000000001s)]
*  for certain, but I have a couple of theories. One, well, first let me say it's totally sincere. They [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1346.88s)]
*  mean it. I mean, Ann Applebaum means it and I know her and she's like, you know, I don't think [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1351.36s)]
*  she thinks of herself as a terrible person. I'm sure her kids love her. I don't think she's Stalin. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1357.12s)]
*  I'm not saying that, but effectively she's arguing for a totalitarian state and why is she doing that? [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1361.52s)]
*  And I think there are two reasons. One, she does have, and they all have, this kind of unshakable [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1368.1599999999999s)]
*  belief in their superiority because they went to National Cathedral School and Cornell or something. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1374.0s)]
*  I mean, they really are all midwits, very much including her, but they believe that they've [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1378.72s)]
*  ascended to the top of our system out of merit. Okay, that's the first thing they believe. The [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1383.5200000000002s)]
*  second thing they believe is that they're in danger. They're hysterical because they're afraid. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1387.68s)]
*  Now, why are they afraid? It's obvious that they're afraid. Frank Foer, you know, who was my editor at [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1393.5200000000002s)]
*  one point at the New Republic, who's a very thoughtful and very smart person and a nice [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1398.4s)]
*  person actually, has become hysterically, completely hysterical and arguing for totalitarianism. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1403.68s)]
*  Why is that? And I don't know, I haven't talked to him. He would never talk to me again, but [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1409.92s)]
*  I think they feel that the jig is up kind of onto them and if they allow democracy to proceed [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1414.8s)]
*  in say the presidential race in this country, they're going to be in deep trouble. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1423.1200000000001s)]
*  I think they think they've gone too far. They've done too much to stop the populist movement and [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1427.28s)]
*  if they allow it to succeed, like there's going to be a reckoning. And I think they feel that on an [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1432.8s)]
*  animal level and they're terrified. They're clearly terrified. I don't know if you read the last [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1438.56s)]
*  special issue of the Atlantic, but it's panic. Yeah, it's self-terror. Yeah, I mean, yeah. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1443.2s)]
*  The Washington Post saying, we're really headed to dictatorship. I mean, the rhetoric is really [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1449.36s)]
*  ramped up now and I agree that they, you know, actually do believe it. They've talked themselves [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1453.76s)]
*  into it and I think, you know, I hate this like constant comparison of everybody we don't like to [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1458.32s)]
*  Nazis. So I say this not to do that, but you know, Hannah Arendt observed when she watched [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1463.28s)]
*  the Nuremberg trials, what she called the banality of evil, that like you think that people who are [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1468.8s)]
*  doing evil things and tyrannical things have horns growing out of their head and are like fangs with [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1472.96s)]
*  blood dripping out of it. And usually they're just kind of like very mild personalities who get [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1477.12s)]
*  swept up into their own righteousness and have no ability to see what it is they're doing. And I [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1482.88s)]
*  think most of all, they know the public hates them. They know the public doesn't listen to them [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1488.4s)]
*  anymore. In fact, the public, they hear them saying something, wants to do the opposite, [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1492.0s)]
*  which is why Trump being indicted actually has politically strengthened him because people don't [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1496.08s)]
*  trust the guardians of these systems, like the people at the Atlantic and like the people who [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1501.04s)]
*  are in DC. Let me just ask you about one more question before we get to your new media because [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1506.08s)]
*  I do think you're- Can I interject one thing and just say about- One of the great shocks for me [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1509.76s)]
*  as an aging man is to see Hannah Arendt and Sigmund Freud written out of the public conversation. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1516.8799999999999s)]
*  Both of them were huge when I was a kid. Smart people read Sigmund Freud or talked about Sigmund [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1523.84s)]
*  Freud or underwent Freudian analysis and read Hannah Arendt. And both of them are so unfashionable [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1528.72s)]
*  now for reasons that no one will specify. I'm sure my kids have never heard of either one of them. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1534.24s)]
*  And why is that? Because both of them had a deeper analysis of human motive. Both of them were [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1538.8s)]
*  concerned with why people do things. And in general, we've kind of given up trying to figure [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1545.2s)]
*  out why people do things. Well, why is that? Because the people doing things don't want their [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1549.9199999999998s)]
*  motives analyzed. That's why. And so Hannah Arendt, whatever you think of her, was like a very honest [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1554.08s)]
*  observer of people, like too honest for today's discourse. And I have to say if Hannah Arendt [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1558.96s)]
*  were around, I think she would judge the Atlantic very harshly. I mean that. Yeah, I'm always [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1565.12s)]
*  fascinated by this kind of underlying motive. Adam Smith in The Wealth of Nations in 1776 [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1569.6s)]
*  warned about this human desire to go to war as long as the people who get to order the wars get [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1577.4399999999998s)]
*  to stay safe in imperial capitals, that they get this kind of pulsating sense of amusement and [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1582.9599999999998s)]
*  purpose and strength and how they don't actually want the war to end because they love to read the [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1588.32s)]
*  papers and see all the conquering achievements of this army, of their army, while they stay safe. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1592.96s)]
*  And I mean nothing is more relevant to our current political culture than that psychoanalysis before [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1599.1200000000001s)]
*  psychoanalysis even existed. Let me just ask you, I do want to get to this new media outlet because [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1604.4s)]
*  I think one of the reasons they're scared is because they see the ascension of new media that [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1610.32s)]
*  they have no ability to control of independent media. But just before we get there, just one [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1613.68s)]
*  last question about this international right that really interests me, which is, you know, you and I [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1617.76s)]
*  have talked a lot about how like Trump's America First politics and this agenda have changed foreign [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1622.0s)]
*  policy, the foreign policy thinking of the American right in so many ways. He ran against Bush-Cheney [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1628.0s)]
*  wars and neoconservatism and it opened up all this space to question the CIA and be skeptical of the [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1633.28s)]
*  FBI in a way that I'd never seen before in the American right. But it also kind of transformed [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1639.04s)]
*  economic policy. He frequently kind of denounced the classic sort of Reaganomics, this idea that, [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1645.12s)]
*  oh we should all cheer for the richest people in our society to get richer because a rising tide [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1652.2399999999998s)]
*  lifts all boats and everybody watches Raytheon and Boeing and BlackRock and Amazon get richer [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1656.8s)]
*  and richer and richer and their boats aren't rising. And it really led a lot of people who [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1661.9199999999998s)]
*  have been capitalists their whole lives to at least start questioning not capitalism as a theory, [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1667.28s)]
*  but capitalism how it manifests in American society. What is your view about sort of where [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1672.0s)]
*  the populist right is, the Trump movement is when it comes to these core questions of economic [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1679.84s)]
*  theory and economic populism? I think a lot of people have awakened to the now demonstrable fact [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1686.96s)]
*  that libertarian economics was a scam perpetrated by the beneficiaries of the economic system [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1695.12s)]
*  that they were defending. So they created this whole intellectual framework to justify the private [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1701.44s)]
*  equity culture that's hollowed out the country. That's my personal view and I've seen it up close [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1707.3600000000001s)]
*  my whole life so I think it's a fair assessment. I think a smarter way to assess an economic system [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1711.44s)]
*  is by its results. So you can assign whatever name you want to the economic system of the United [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1718.24s)]
*  States, you could call it market capitalism, you could call it a whole host of different things, [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1723.2s)]
*  but I don't think any of that's useful. Those are boring conversations. I think you need to ask, [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1728.3200000000002s)]
*  does this economic system produce a lot of dollar stores? And if it does, it's not a system that you [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1733.3600000000001s)]
*  want because it degrades people and it makes their lives worse and it increases exponentially the [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1739.3600000000001s)]
*  amount of ugliness in your society and anything that increases ugliness is evil. And it's just [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1744.96s)]
*  kind of, let's just start there. So if it's such a good system, why do we have all these dollar stores? [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1750.88s)]
*  A dollar store is the clear, I mean it's not the only ugly thing being created in the United States [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1755.76s)]
*  but it's one of the most common and it's certainly the most obvious. So if you have a dollar store, [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1760.96s)]
*  you're degraded and any town that has a dollar store does not get better, it gets worse and the [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1767.12s)]
*  people who live there lead lives that are worse. So and the counter argument to the extent there [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1771.28s)]
*  is one, oh they buy cheaper stuff, great, but they become more unhappy and the dollar store itself is [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1776.56s)]
*  a sort of symbol, it's a physical thing, it's a real thing, it's not just a metaphor but it's also [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1784.16s)]
*  a metaphor for your total lack of control over where you live and over the imposition of [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1788.5600000000002s)]
*  aggressively in your face ugly structures that send one message to you which is you mean nothing. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1796.0s)]
*  You are a consumer, not a human being or a citizen. And so again, I don't know what we call our current [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1802.88s)]
*  system but its effects are grotesque, they're grotesque, it's wrecked. I've been here 54 years [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1809.28s)]
*  and I watch carefully, that's my only gift is I watch and this has become a much uglier place, [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1815.44s)]
*  a much more crowded place, a much more hostile place, a place that cares much less about people. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1821.2s)]
*  So whatever system that produces that outcome is a bad system and you can call me whatever you want, [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1826.72s)]
*  oh you're a socialist, I don't care what you call me actually, I'm beyond caring about name calling, [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1833.28s)]
*  it's bad and I oppose it. Yeah, believe me, I know I got in a lot of trouble once for suggesting [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1838.32s)]
*  that you and Steve Bannon are a lot more socialist in a certain limited sense than a lot of people [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1843.4399999999998s)]
*  who claim that title and of course the nuance of that point got completely lost but I do think the [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1849.76s)]
*  fact that you are focused so much on kind of the welfare of ordinary people and you go to anywhere [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1854.8799999999999s)]
*  in the world, you go to obviously you go to Western Europe and you see these structures that [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1862.56s)]
*  people spent 200 years building just for the sheer beauty of it and you go into nature and you see [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1867.76s)]
*  beauty like it never exists and you go to developing countries and you see a kind of dedication to [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1873.28s)]
*  buildings even that are designed to be inspiring and to kind of stimulate things in the human soul [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1878.96s)]
*  and then you go to the places in the United States where our infrastructure is falling apart, [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1884.88s)]
*  where our new structures are designed to be as ugly as possible and it's a very difficult thing [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1888.72s)]
*  to do to communicate these sort of spiritual components of our politics but ultimately politics [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1893.44s)]
*  does have no purpose other than to elevate the happiness of our citizenry and by every metric [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1900.4s)]
*  the happiness of our citizenry is declining, suicide, addiction, use of antidepressants, all of that. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9cB3Ti1gs&t=1906.16s)]
