# Pro-Israel Protesters ASSAULT NYC Woman
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [April 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM)
*  Over the weekend, there was a protest in the Brooklyn neighborhood where Ben Gavir went [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=0.0s)]
*  to speak and meet with religious leaders in Brooklyn. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  And it ended up that the crowd of these Jewish religious fanatics welcoming Ben Gavir, that [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=22.56s)]
*  crowd ended up becoming very violent and attacking at least two women physically, one of whom [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=32.72s)]
*  is an Israeli Jew, but who nonetheless is protesting Ben Gavir. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=39.04s)]
*  Here for the New York Times, the NYPD is investigating pro-Israel crowds' attack on women in Brooklyn. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=45.16s)]
*  Quote, on Thursday night, pro-Palestinian demonstrators gathered outside the Chabot-Lubavitch World [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=51.8s)]
*  Headquarters on Eastern Parkway in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, where at Mar Ben Gavir, the Israeli [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=56.76s)]
*  security minister was to speak. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=61.68s)]
*  The headquarters is an important religious site in the Hasidic community, and intense [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=63.44s)]
*  clashes erupted between protesters and counter-protesters outside, videos posted on social media by [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=67.44s)]
*  members of both sides show. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=73.64s)]
*  At one point, hundreds of men and boys, hundreds, most of them Jewish, surrounded one woman, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=76.32000000000001s)]
*  a woman, according to the police and videos of the episode. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=82.76s)]
*  In a statement to the New York Times, a woman identified herself as the victim, but asked [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=86.2s)]
*  that her name not be used for fear of retribution, so she's scared in the United States to identify [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=90.28s)]
*  herself as the victim of mob violence. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=96.44000000000001s)]
*  On the part of these people at the Brooklyn Synagogue, we already hear Ben Gavir speak. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=100.08000000000001s)]
*  She said she was not even involved in the protest, but had been watching with neighbors [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=104.28s)]
*  and pulled a scarf over her face when people began filming. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=108.24s)]
*  She said she was quickly encircled by an angry crowd who shouted abuse at her and moved near [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=111.24s)]
*  a line of police officers for protection. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=116.16s)]
*  The crowd, the victimized Jewish crowd, petrified to even leave their house because it's so [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=119.24000000000001s)]
*  unsafe for them in the United States, that crowd began to chant, quote, death to Arabs [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=126.0s)]
*  in Hebrew. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=131.52s)]
*  Death to Arabs in Hebrew. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=132.8s)]
*  Is that a genocidal chant? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=135.8s)]
*  Death to Arabs? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=137.36s)]
*  We're constantly hearing that people on campus chanted death to Jews or kill all Jews, which [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=138.36s)]
*  never actually happened. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=144.4s)]
*  But here's a crowd of hundreds of men as they're menacing and physically attacking a woman, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=146.20000000000002s)]
*  a single woman, walking down the street, chanting death to Arabs in Hebrew. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=152.88s)]
*  And they followed her in an officerhood, began escorting her video shows. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=157.68s)]
*  Many also shouted racist, sexist, and anti-era profanities as others shoved her. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=160.84s)]
*  At least one hurled an orange construction cone at her head before the officer was able [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=166.52s)]
*  to put her in a police vehicle, the footage shows. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=171.44s)]
*  The woman said she was terrified as members of the crowd kicked her in the back, spat [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=173.9s)]
*  at her, and threw objects at her head. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=178.0s)]
*  And there are videos showing all this. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=179.64000000000001s)]
*  In another incident, pro-Israel counter protesters harassed a second woman who was separated [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=183.16s)]
*  fellow pro-Palestinian demonstrators and were injured, Mayor Adams said. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=188.46s)]
*  Now let's be very clear about one thing. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=194.02s)]
*  Even if that woman had been part of the protest, in the United States, at least for the moment, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=197.52s)]
*  you're allowed to protest anything you want. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=205.22s)]
*  You're certainly allowed to protest a foreign official of a foreign government coming to [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=210.06s)]
*  the United States. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=214.02s)]
*  You're allowed to protest. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=215.02s)]
*  That's one of the basic rights in the United States, is to assemble and protest. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=216.06s)]
*  So it should go without saying that even if she were protesting, Ben Gavir, which I think [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=223.9s)]
*  any decent person would do, that wouldn't justify having a bunch of men and boys who [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=229.64000000000001s)]
*  they've indoctrinated to love and worship Israel physically attacking them. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=238.02s)]
*  This is still the United States, and we're still free to protest, especially foreigners, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=243.28s)]
*  foreign leaders, without being physically assaulted. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=248.44s)]
*  Here is one of the videos. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=253.92s)]
*  This one is the one that shows the Jewish men and young teenagers menacing this woman, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=255.88s)]
*  kicking her, chanting at her, death to Arabs in Hebrew. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=266.4s)]
*  And you can watch this video. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=270.12s)]
*  You see, she's just trying to walk away. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=272.72s)]
*  The police officer, she has one police officer, and they just keep running up behind her, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=292.8s)]
*  kicking her, hitting her, throwing things at her, while they chant death to Arabs. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=296.76000000000005s)]
*  Is this what we want in the United States? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=302.72s)]
*  A bunch of violent mobs physically attacking lone women? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=308.96000000000004s)]
*  100, 200 men to punish her for the crime of protesting, which again she wasn't even doing? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=314.20000000000005s)]
*  And we're supposed to believe that this is the group in the United States that are the [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=324.56s)]
*  only real victims, the only real endangered victim group in the United States are American [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=329.68s)]
*  Jews who are too afraid to even go out on the street and therefore need the protection [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=335.12s)]
*  of the government and the state with special privileges and rights and even including censorship [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=340.12s)]
*  of speech, including campus censorship. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=345.0s)]
*  These are the people who are sacrificing free speech on campuses in order to protect. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=347.72s)]
*  Do they look like a victim group to you? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=352.64s)]
*  Now there was a second woman who wasn't just menace but beaten, and pretty severely. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=358.64s)]
*  And what you had is pictures of her that circulated on social media, including here. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=367.8s)]
*  with her face all bruised, her head all bruised. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=382.72s)]
*  And there were people on Twitter, here is Yael Yakobie, you may remember him, he was [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=388.52000000000004s)]
*  the 22 year old student at the University of Pennsylvania, who Mike Johnson had come [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=400.96000000000004s)]
*  to Congress and he stood up and he said, I am not safe, I do not feel safe. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=407.44s)]
*  This big 22 year old student at the University of Pennsylvania, one of the most privileged [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=414.4s)]
*  people on the planet, goes to Congress and says, I am not safe, using exactly the language [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=419.72s)]
*  of the woke laugh that had been so mocked and criticized by these same people. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=426.28s)]
*  So while he was weeping and whining about how he doesn't feel safe even though he was [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=431.8s)]
*  never physically attacked or threatened, here is what he said about this Jewish woman who [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=435.36s)]
*  ended up being beaten. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=445.48s)]
*  And here is the photo that we have of her. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=448.56s)]
*  Here you can see her there, she is bleeding, she has water on her pants, and this is how [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=454.08s)]
*  he interpreted that photo and what he said, quote, she tried to assault Jews outside of [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=462.76s)]
*  a synagogue, she ended up leaving in handcuffs and peeing her pants, FAFO which means fuck [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=466.71999999999997s)]
*  around and find out, meaning she is the one who is to blame. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=472.76s)]
*  A woman who got physically mauled in the United States for protesting, these Israel loyalists [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=477.76s)]
*  are saying yes, she got what she deserved, you don't protest Israel in the United States [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=485.96s)]
*  unless you want to get beaten. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=490.40000000000003s)]
*  Here from an Israeli who does a lot of propaganda in English, Haviv Reddick Gur, he says, quote, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=493.0s)]
*  Jews don't need to be polite or nuanced, not if you just showed up at their synagogue, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=500.48s)]
*  they need to walk right up to you and punch you in the face because you are a vile bigot [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=505.40000000000003s)]
*  trying to intimidate them. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=509.0s)]
*  Lubiters are famously kind and outgoing, you deserved worse. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=511.96000000000004s)]
*  I mean is that what we want, people in Israel and their loyalists in the United States telling [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=517.2s)]
*  Americans that they are not allowed to protest, you can protest anywhere, just not a gathering [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=526.2s)]
*  of Jews at a synagogue to welcome an extremist foreign leader who has been convicted of terrorism [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=531.2s)]
*  in Israel and has been saying wretched, rancid things of the kind we showed you. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=538.2s)]
*  He's basically saying look, you can protest whatever you want, you just don't protest [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=545.2s)]
*  Jews, you don't protest Israel or we're going to punch you in the face and in fact if you [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=549.2s)]
*  do it you deserve worse than that. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=555.2s)]
*  Here from Dropsite News which reported on all of this, quote, the only thing that gives [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=560.2s)]
*  me some joy is that while all the Zios were celebrating and laughing at me I'm over here [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=565.2s)]
*  thinking you all hit a Jew with a damn Israeli passport, great job. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=570.2s)]
*  And this is what they report, quote, a New York woman shares on Instagram in a post that [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=575.2s)]
*  she is Jewish and has an Israeli passport and was wearing a keffiyeh on Thursday night [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=581.2s)]
*  so she was wearing what is associated with a Palestinian scarf even though she was Jewish [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=587.2s)]
*  and Israeli and was protesting Ben Gavir on American soil in Crown Heights. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=592.2s)]
*  They go on where racist Israeli national security minister, Edmar Ben Gavir, was giving a speech. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=603.2s)]
*  He was left bloodied with a head wound that required medical attention after a violent [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=608.2s)]
*  mob of mostly Orthodox Jewish counter protesters attacked and assaulted pro-Palestine protesters. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=613.2s)]
*  The incident also led to six arrests. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=618.2s)]
*  And then this is the picture that they posted of the woman who again is an Israeli Jew. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=621.2s)]
*  And you see here someone that she says the only thing that gives me some joy is that [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=630.2s)]
*  while all the Zios were celebrating and laughing at me I'm over here thinking you all [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=642.2s)]
*  had a Jew, a damn Israeli passport, great job. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=646.2s)]
*  So that was her comment that they were chanting anti-Arab stuff. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=650.2s)]
*  They thought she was an Arab. Instead she was a Jew. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=654.2s)]
*  There she is lying on the ground and here she is with her face beaten up. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=657.2s)]
*  And as I said, there she is too as a bunch of different people including Israelis who [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=660.2s)]
*  don't even live in our country, not even citizens of the United States, not citizens of the [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=669.2s)]
*  United States, they're just Israelis. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=674.2s)]
*  They have no connection to the United States at all but they use social media to say, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=676.2s)]
*  yeah, you can't protest our leaders and if you do you're going to get punched in the [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=681.2s)]
*  face even though you probably deserve worse. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=684.2s)]
*  To what extent are we willing to sacrifice our core liberties, our basic rights guaranteed [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=688.2s)]
*  by the Constitution and servitude to this foreign country and to its loyalists inside [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rysCuyqrtjM&t=693.2s)]
