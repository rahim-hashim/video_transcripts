# "Inside Job!" Vivekâ€™s Revealing Clash w/ CNN on Jan 6
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [December 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw)
*  Speaking of corrupted media outlets, Vivek Ramaswamy went on CNN last night where he [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=0.0s)]
*  had a town hall that was hosted by one of the new CNN personalities, Abby Phillips, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=12.56s)]
*  who came to CNN from the Washington Post. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=18.2s)]
*  One of the things that she asked him about was Vivek's claim that, as I said, he made [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=23.48s)]
*  for the first time on my show, he came on very shortly after all the video footage of [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=28.72s)]
*  January 6th was released, not just the parts that Liz Cheney and Adam Schiff selected for [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=35.28s)]
*  us to see, but all of it. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=41.48s)]
*  And you saw things like the police leading a lot of the protesters into the Capitol, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=45.68s)]
*  not violently but peacefully. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=51.2s)]
*  And Vivek saw that and he did a lot of research into the fact that there were FBI informants [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=54.6s)]
*  on the ground at the Capitol. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=59.32s)]
*  The FBI was getting real-time information on January 6th from its informants who were [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=61.68s)]
*  part of the insurrectionists, but they also had infiltrated every one of the three groups [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=67.0s)]
*  that ended up being accused of having organized this so-called insurrection, the Proud Boys, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=73.92s)]
*  the Three Percenters, and the Oath Keepers. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=80.92s)]
*  The FBI had its pentacles in every single one of these groups. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=82.56s)]
*  So when Vivek is saying it's an inside job, what he means is the FBI was all around it [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=87.4s)]
*  and all over it. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=91.60000000000001s)]
*  He doesn't mean they planned it or coordinated it, but he also talks about the fact that [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=92.60000000000001s)]
*  that Michigan case of where they arrested a bunch of people on the right, right-wing [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=97.08s)]
*  anti-government activists, and claimed they wanted to kidnap Michigan government aggression [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=104.08s)]
*  Whitmer right before the election, was filled with FBI informants as well. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=110.46000000000001s)]
*  And as a result, several of those people ended up being acquitted because they were directed [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=116.06s)]
*  and lured by the FBI's informants who were being controlled by the FBI. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=119.76s)]
*  This is what the FBI has been doing for decades. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=124.02s)]
*  But if you say this, because the corporate media is so loyal to and subservient to and [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=127.46000000000001s)]
*  defensive of the U.S. security state and the FBI, they act like you're crazy. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=133.94s)]
*  The FBI doesn't create crimes. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=137.70000000000002s)]
*  I spent years as part of the war on terror reporting on cases where the FBI didn't have [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=141.70000000000002s)]
*  enough terrorism cases in the United States to justify all the money it was spending and [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=147.86s)]
*  all the powers it said it needed, including eavesdropping without warrants. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=153.02s)]
*  So they would have these scummy informants who they caught in other crimes like embezzlement [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=158.28s)]
*  or common financial fraud, pretend to be a new attendee of a mosque somewhere, and they [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=163.94000000000003s)]
*  would target these young Muslims, often ones with severe financial problems or emotional [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=172.46s)]
*  difficulties. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=176.94000000000003s)]
*  And the FBI informant would get plots that came from the FBI, hey, let's go blow up this [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=177.94000000000003s)]
*  bridge. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=185.14000000000001s)]
*  And if they said no, they'd come back the next day and say, hey, I have this money, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=186.14000000000001s)]
*  I have this plan. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=190.42000000000002s)]
*  Look, here's the blueprint of the bridge. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=191.82s)]
*  And they kept luring them and coercing them and pressuring them. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=193.98s)]
*  So many of the domestic terrorism cases that the FBI claimed it disrupted and patted itself [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=196.9s)]
*  on the back for having done so actually were devised by the FBI, directed by the FBI. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=202.16s)]
*  Through their use of informants, they've infiltrated political groups in the United States for [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=208.32s)]
*  decades to do this. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=211.82s)]
*  And yet, these idiots in the corporate media who think it's unpatriotic to criticize the [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=213.84s)]
*  FBI, who used to say, oh, you can't speak ill of Robert Mueller, question Robert Mueller. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=219.42000000000002s)]
*  He led the FBI to do so as to impugn the good men and women, keeping our country safe. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=226.98000000000002s)]
*  They don't know this history. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=232.14000000000001s)]
*  They're empty headed. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=233.9s)]
*  And so when Vivek was at this town hall and Abby Phillips wanted to ask him about this [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=236.38s)]
*  theory, I think that's totally fine. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=241.94s)]
*  She should have asked him. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=244.1s)]
*  I asked him about it as well. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=245.1s)]
*  But as you're going to see, she was so agitated, so uncomfortable, had no clue what to do. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=247.7s)]
*  She just wouldn't let him speak. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=257.14s)]
*  She just kept talking over him and calling him a liar and insisting that he had no evidence. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=259.62s)]
*  And he just let's watch this. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=266.7s)]
*  We're going to play it in just a second. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=268.53999999999996s)]
*  There we go. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=270.41999999999996s)]
*  Let me ask you about something that you said at the debate last week. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=271.41999999999996s)]
*  You used the phrase inside job to describe what happened on January 6th. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=274.22s)]
*  The next day, Capitol rioter Alan Hosteler highlighted your comments at his sentencing. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=280.66s)]
*  He is going to prison for 11 years. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=286.98s)]
*  A hostiter threatened members of Congress. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=290.26000000000005s)]
*  He brought a hatchet, knives, pepper spray, sun batons, tactical gear to the U.S. Capitol. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=293.40000000000003s)]
*  Are you concerned that a convicted felon like that is now promoting your comments [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=299.72s)]
*  in court? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=304.20000000000005s)]
*  So first of all, this question is so stupid. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=305.20000000000005s)]
*  It's so stupid. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=308.16s)]
*  Think about this question. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=309.52000000000004s)]
*  So there's this bad guy. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=311.88000000000005s)]
*  He's in a criminal trial, she's saying, and he used Vivek's comments about January 6th [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=314.74s)]
*  in an effort to defend himself. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=323.04s)]
*  And then she's like, aren't you concerned about that? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=325.24s)]
*  Why would you be concerned about that? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=327.38000000000005s)]
*  Who cares? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=329.14s)]
*  That has nothing to do with anything. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=330.14s)]
*  The only thing that matters is, is what Vivek is saying truthful? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=331.14s)]
*  Does it have evidentiary support? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=335.08s)]
*  If it's truthful and a January 6th defendant then cites it, that's how the justice system [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=338.09999999999997s)]
*  is supposed to work. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=344.34s)]
*  Look at this primitive, moronic, low grade tactic she's using. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=345.9s)]
*  Oh, this bad person over here cited what you said. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=352.97999999999996s)]
*  Someone that proved that what you're doing is terrible. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=357.82s)]
*  It's just such a low brow, unjournalistic way of thinking. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=362.28s)]
*  The only thing that matters is, is that comment true or not? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=367.0s)]
*  But she's trying, of course, to speak to a liberal audience and say, you know those January [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=370.2s)]
*  6th interactionists, those are bad people. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=374.68s)]
*  They're using what he's saying in their attempt to reduce their massive sentences, their prison [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=376.56s)]
*  sentences, then somehow that means the statement is obviously bad or false. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=383.86s)]
*  It's such an intellectually dishonest tactic, but she just can't formulate a question. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=389.5s)]
*  CNN can't formulate a question based on the merits. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=395.42s)]
*  They have no idea what he's talking about. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=398.06s)]
*  They don't understand the arguments he's making. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=400.74s)]
*  Because the world of CNN is so closed that it's not like they know this evidence and [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=403.86s)]
*  are pretending it's not there. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=409.98s)]
*  They really don't know what people like this don't hear it. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=411.7s)]
*  The only people they speak to are other liberals or other liberal journalists who are just [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=413.9s)]
*  as empty headed, who are just as trite and read from the same script. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=417.9s)]
*  It is a closed information system. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=422.06s)]
*  Watch how this proceeds. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=425.14s)]
*  Here's my concern, Abby. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=426.82s)]
*  And I want to tell you guys where I'm at. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=428.18s)]
*  If you had told me, it's close to three years ago that January 6th, 2021 happened. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=431.08s)]
*  If you had told me three years ago, back when I was a biotech CEO, not steeped in this [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=435.26s)]
*  I was just consuming passive media, but was focused on my world of developing medicines. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=439.86s)]
*  If you had told me that January 6th was in any way an inside job, the subject of government [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=444.58000000000004s)]
*  entrapment, I would have told you that was crazy talk. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=448.42s)]
*  Fringe conspiracy theory nonsense. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=451.94s)]
*  I could tell you now, having gone somewhat deep in this, it's not. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=455.5s)]
*  I mean, the reality is this. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=460.46000000000004s)]
*  We do have a government, first of all, we have technology that has lied to us systematically [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=462.42s)]
*  over the last several years about the origin of COVID-19, about the Hunter Biden laptop [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=465.96s)]
*  that we were told was false by 51 CIA experts and otherwise before we now know that it was [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=470.47999999999996s)]
*  true. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=475.76s)]
*  You could go straight down the list, the Trump Russia disinformation collusion hoax, all [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=476.76s)]
*  of it. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=481.15999999999997s)]
*  Now we come to January 6th. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=482.15999999999997s)]
*  The reality is we know that there were federal law enforcement agents in that field. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=483.96s)]
*  We don't know how many. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=487.52s)]
*  I think it's a shame if I may finish this answer. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=488.79999999999995s)]
*  Well, let me just, I'm going to go ahead and interrupt you here because you're saying that [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=490.84s)]
*  the establishment doesn't approve of this message. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=495.44s)]
*  I know this, but we should be able to talk about this. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=496.44s)]
*  You're saying that there were federal agents in the crowd. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=498.12s)]
*  This is important to talk about. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=499.48s)]
*  You are saying there were federal agents in the crowd on January 6th. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=500.48s)]
*  There is no evidence that there were federal agents in the crowd on January 6th. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=505.72s)]
*  So why before Congress, when pressed on what the number was, they didn't say there were [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=509.68s)]
*  none. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=513.04s)]
*  They just couldn't say how many there were. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=514.04s)]
*  So you're saying that there's no, that you have not seen any evidence that there were. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=515.04s)]
*  And so you assume that there were. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=518.84s)]
*  We've seen multiple informants suggesting that there were. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=519.84s)]
*  We know people were FBI informants, so we're asking you to. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=521.4s)]
*  Is there any evidence? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=523.6s)]
*  May I just finish this and then you can come back and question me. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=525.2s)]
*  Well, let me clarify. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=526.9200000000001s)]
*  I know it's very uncomfortable for you. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=527.9200000000001s)]
*  I'm going to clarify my question because. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=528.9200000000001s)]
*  I know this is an uncomfortable issue for many people, but we have to do the truth here. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=529.9200000000001s)]
*  I'm going to clarify my question because I want to make sure that you understand what [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=531.76s)]
*  I'm asking you. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=534.4s)]
*  Oh, I understand this equally. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=535.4s)]
*  I told you, I was working three years ago. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=536.4s)]
*  I'm not here now. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=537.4s)]
*  Where is the evidence? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=538.4s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=539.4s)]
*  Where is the evidence that the government had a plot. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=540.4s)]
*  So let's do this. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=542.9200000000001s)]
*  An inside job. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=543.9200000000001s)]
*  But no, I'm going to tell you what an inside job is because I'm not going to, I'm not, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=544.9200000000001s)]
*  you respect. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=546.9200000000001s)]
*  The foment of violence on January 6th. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=547.9200000000001s)]
*  So first of all, she completely distorted what he said so that she can have like her [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=549.24s)]
*  big moment. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=554.76s)]
*  Like I stand up to politicians and I don't let them get away with false statements. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=555.76s)]
*  I corrected, I fact checked them. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=560.1999999999999s)]
*  And so she took what he said, which is that there were FBI informants on the ground. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=562.64s)]
*  There were FBI informants in this group that the FBI has used in Trapman in the past. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=567.8s)]
*  And she made it into a caricature. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=573.04s)]
*  Here's the evidence that it was the FBI that did this plot, that it was an inside job, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=576.1999999999999s)]
*  that they were the ones who did it. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=579.4399999999999s)]
*  And that's not what he said. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=580.4399999999999s)]
*  And she's interrupting him every four words. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=582.0s)]
*  I was counting as I was watching that. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=584.0s)]
*  He couldn't get more than four words out. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=586.28s)]
*  He was trying to answer her question. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=588.4399999999999s)]
*  She didn't want an answer. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=590.04s)]
*  She wanted it to be her moment where people said, oh, wow, Abby Phillips is a tough interviewer. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=591.1999999999999s)]
*  But she wasn't doing anything that is difficult or that is tough or journalistically impressive. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=596.5999999999999s)]
*  She just wouldn't shut up and listen to his answer. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=601.8199999999999s)]
*  Do you know how easy it is to have a guest on the show? [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=605.08s)]
*  And I ask them a question. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=608.6800000000001s)]
*  And then I wait about two seconds. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=610.44s)]
*  And then I interrupt and start talking over them. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=612.4200000000001s)]
*  And then I make a point. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=615.2s)]
*  And then they go to speak again. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=617.1600000000001s)]
*  And then I interrupt them six seconds later and start yelling at them and telling them [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=618.1600000000001s)]
*  they have no evidence. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=621.6800000000001s)]
*  This is not difficult. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=622.6800000000001s)]
*  This is the easiest thing in the world to do. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=623.6800000000001s)]
*  When you look at who these journalists think are such great interviewers like Mehdi Hassan, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=626.48s)]
*  half the time what they're really doing, or more than half the time, is they're just filibustering [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=630.84s)]
*  They're yelling at people. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=634.4399999999999s)]
*  They're speaking over them. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=635.9599999999999s)]
*  They're letting them speak for seven seconds and distorting what they're saying. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=637.52s)]
*  These are not smart tactics. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=642.4399999999999s)]
*  These are not difficult tactics. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=644.6s)]
*  They're not impressive tactics. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=646.28s)]
*  If I have someone on my show, I'm going to ask them the hardest question I can think [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=647.9599999999999s)]
*  of. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=652.48s)]
*  I'm going to insist they answer. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=653.48s)]
*  But I'm also going to let them give their answer. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=654.48s)]
*  I'm going to listen to it. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=656.4s)]
*  And then I'm going to dissect it. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=657.4s)]
*  I'm going to point out where it's wrong. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=658.4s)]
*  I'm going to point to evidence. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=660.1999999999999s)]
*  I'm always going to let them speak because that's the coward's way out. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=661.52s)]
*  So she took what he said, turned it into a joke, and then tried to claim that there was [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=666.12s)]
*  no evidence for it. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=671.48s)]
*  He's too smart to allow that to happen. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=672.48s)]
*  So let's listen to how this unfolds. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=673.6s)]
*  I'm not going to let you put words in my mouth. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=675.24s)]
*  I'm going to put my words in my mouth. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=677.24s)]
*  And I'm going to tell you what I mean by that. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=679.04s)]
*  Where is the evidence that the government was involved in planning or executing January [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=680.64s)]
*  6th? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=684.84s)]
*  I'm going to give you hard facts. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=685.84s)]
*  And if I may, Abby, I know this is going to be a little uncomfortable, but we're going [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=687.84s)]
*  to go through this and you can push back on it. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=691.0400000000001s)]
*  And you can push back on that. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=693.0400000000001s)]
*  And let's do this fairly. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=694.4s)]
*  Why did they suppress footage of now what's been released? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=696.6s)]
*  200 hours of footage of shooting rubber bullets into that crowd, shooting tear gas into that [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=700.84s)]
*  crowd. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=705.52s)]
*  You didn't see that before. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=706.52s)]
*  You saw what the response was to that. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=707.52s)]
*  Now you see footage coming out of actually rolling out the red carpet for Capitol Police [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=708.8000000000001s)]
*  allowing people in. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=713.8000000000001s)]
*  Mr. Ramaswamy, again. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=714.8000000000001s)]
*  So he said, look, just let me answer. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=715.8000000000001s)]
*  Let me explain. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=719.12s)]
*  You keep asking me for the evidence. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=720.52s)]
*  You keep saying there's no evidence. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=721.52s)]
*  I'm going to tell you what the evidence is. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=722.52s)]
*  And then when I'm done, you can push back all you want. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=724.04s)]
*  She can't, she can't, she can't hear it. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=727.04s)]
*  She won't allow these facts to go over the CNN Airways. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=729.08s)]
*  Do you see how even she just interrupted him again? [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=732.28s)]
*  It was maybe like 20 seconds of speaking, but she tried interrupting him after about [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=735.36s)]
*  10 seconds. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=739.52s)]
*  And he just kind of pushed her away and talked over her. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=740.52s)]
*  This is pathetic. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=745.0s)]
*  Let's listen. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=747.04s)]
*  The vast majority of the footage shows police officers being overrun by violent rioters. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=748.04s)]
*  That was the vast majority of the show. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=759.9599999999999s)]
*  So here's what entrapments. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=762.12s)]
*  You can't cherry pick. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=763.12s)]
*  I'm not cherry picking. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=764.12s)]
*  If I may finish, Abby. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=765.12s)]
*  If I may finish, Abby. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=766.12s)]
*  I'm not cherry picking. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=767.12s)]
*  To the contrary. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=768.12s)]
*  You can't cherry pick examples and say that is what happened on January 6th. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=769.12s)]
*  We've been listening to this now for three minutes and 45 seconds. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=775.2s)]
*  I don't think there has been one time other than when he first started trying to explain [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=779.44s)]
*  himself when he was maybe able to talk for 20 seconds that she has let him speak without [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=786.72s)]
*  talking over him. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=790.84s)]
*  It just gives you a headache. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=792.36s)]
*  It's totally worthless, but it also shows what they're scared of. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=793.6s)]
*  We're going to show you in just a second what Favik is referring to that I guarantee you [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=797.5200000000001s)]
*  Abby Phillips has no knowledge of, even though it's from the New York Times, because it just [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=802.2s)]
*  doesn't comport with her worldview or her narrative. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=806.6800000000001s)]
*  But she's just chattering the whole time. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=809.6800000000001s)]
*  Just talking over him. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=813.2s)]
*  She keeps saying she wants to hear the evidence, but when he tries to give it to her, she won't [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=814.2s)]
*  let him. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=818.5600000000001s)]
*  When there was 200 hours of cherry picking, it was the government, not me, releasing the [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=819.5600000000001s)]
*  whole thing. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=824.44s)]
*  Let me just finish one thing, too, because this is super important as a topic. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=825.44s)]
*  I think this is a civil libertarian issue of our time. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=828.12s)]
*  Gretchen Whitmer's kidnapping. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=830.2s)]
*  I want to be really clear on this, because it's the same issue in the same FBI, same [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=831.2s)]
*  even part of the FBI. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=834.9200000000001s)]
*  Three people who were in an alleged plot to kidnap Gretchen Whitmer were acquitted at [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=836.96s)]
*  the end of trial because it was entrapment. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=842.36s)]
*  That is, government agents put them up to do something they otherwise wouldn't have [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=846.2s)]
*  done. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=849.72s)]
*  They gave them credit cards with spending limits of up to $5,000, encouraged them to [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=850.72s)]
*  buy munitions, planned something they weren't otherwise willing to plan. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=853.76s)]
*  So much so, and I want people at home to know this, especially CNN viewers to know [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=857.64s)]
*  this, is that one of the jurors went to those defendants and apologized afterwards, gave [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=860.88s)]
*  him a hug, apologized, seeing what the government had put a poor guy up to who had to go to [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=867.24s)]
*  some Mexican restaurant across the street to get hot water. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=872.72s)]
*  These people were exploited with credit cards up to $5,000, FBI agents putting them up to [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=875.72s)]
*  a kidnapping plot that we were told was true but was entrapment. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=881.12s)]
*  Same thing with the Capitol Police. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=883.64s)]
*  I mean, the amazing thing about that is he referenced multiple lies that the FBI told [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=885.32s)]
*  that the Russians had blackmail control over Donald Trump, that the Trump campaign criminally [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=914.0s)]
*  conspired with the Russians to hack into the DNC, that the Hunter Biden laptop was Russian [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=920.84s)]
*  disinformation and every one of those lies came from CNN as well as other media outlets [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=927.0s)]
*  and then she has the audacity to say, look, the reason I'm interrupting you is because [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=932.76s)]
*  I cannot allow disinformation to go over the CNN airwaves. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=937.64s)]
*  Now, I don't know how many people are watching this show, but I know that CNN has a very [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=942.52s)]
*  tiny audience. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=949.0s)]
*  So the idea that the CNN airwaves are sacrosanct, it doesn't really matter that much, but do [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=951.3199999999999s)]
*  you see the level of delusion these people have that they can with a straight face say, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=956.64s)]
*  we don't allow disinformation here when so many of the main stories that have come from [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=962.4s)]
*  CNN over the last seven or eight years have been utter lies to say nothing of COVID and [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=966.4399999999999s)]
*  all the disinformation and deceit that came from there or the war in Ukraine over and [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZxad3ye6gw&t=971.8s)]
