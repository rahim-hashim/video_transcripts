# INTERVIEW: Prof. Jeffrey Sachs on President Biden's "Pathetic" Diplomacy and Israel's War in Gaza
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [May 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc)
*  All right, let's move to a different US-financed armed and backed war, which is the Israeli [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=0.0s)]
*  war in Gaza. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  When we've spoken about that over the last six months or so, seven months since it began, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=12.88s)]
*  you often expressed frustration that obviously a lot of people shared about how unwilling [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=18.96s)]
*  the Biden administration seemed to be to impose any limits on the Israelis at all. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=24.88s)]
*  They just kind of, here's all the weapons, here's all the arms, here's US diplomatic [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=29.68s)]
*  protection, do with it what you will. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  Ten days ago or so, the Biden administration announced what they called a temporary suspension [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=36.56s)]
*  of certain weapons being transferred to Israel, presumably in retaliation for the fact that [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=41.96s)]
*  Biden declared the invasion of Ra'a to be a quote, red line and Netanyahu immediately [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=47.36s)]
*  to do it anyway and then did maybe not in full, but certainly did it to a significant [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=52.32s)]
*  extent. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=57.239999999999995s)]
*  A lot of Israel supporters look at that and say, this is a abandonment of Israel, Biden [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=58.839999999999996s)]
*  hates Israel, etc. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=64.03999999999999s)]
*  Whereas a lot of people on the left who support the Palestinian cause are saying, oh, this [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=65.84s)]
*  is pure theater, this is just symbolic, the Israelis already have all those weapons, it's [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=70.56s)]
*  just very temporary. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=74.47999999999999s)]
*  Then announced just yesterday, the day before, another billion dollars in arms to Israel. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=75.72s)]
*  Where on that spectrum do you fall in terms of how you see this announcement of a suspension? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=81.0s)]
*  I think Biden's pathetic, sad, very weak. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=86.12s)]
*  I'm not sure how much he's really in command and with it, but he's very weak and he is [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=89.68s)]
*  unable to communicate properly with his people, that's us, with the American people and certainly [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=97.72s)]
*  unable to carry real diplomacy with Israel and with the Arab and Islamic states. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=107.44s)]
*  So I think he probably is pissed off at Netanyahu, who could not be, but Biden's too weak to [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=115.80000000000001s)]
*  do anything about it. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=126.2s)]
*  In order to do something about it, yes, he would face domestic political opposition. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=127.92s)]
*  He would face the Israel lobby, which is real and it's powerful. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=135.04s)]
*  He would face calls from both parties. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=139.4s)]
*  He would be told, don't do this by his political advisors. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=142.04s)]
*  But you know what? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=146.56s)]
*  Presidents are hired actually to do things that keep the world from blowing apart. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=148.16s)]
*  That's if they do their job, that's their job. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=156.04s)]
*  Biden should stand up and say, no more, Bibi, we're not doing this anymore. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=160.16s)]
*  And there is going to be two state solution. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=166.64s)]
*  And we're voting in the Security Council for UN membership of Palestine. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=170.08s)]
*  And Biden should explain to the American people what this is all about. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=175.68s)]
*  And he would find overwhelming support. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=181.4s)]
*  It actually probably could get a big boost for his reelection because what he's doing [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=184.2s)]
*  right now is utterly unpopular and utterly against the will of a large part of the American [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=188.76s)]
*  people. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=199.0s)]
*  It's clear. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=200.0s)]
*  Only about 30% say they support Biden's approach in the Middle East. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=201.0s)]
*  So he fails to communicate. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=205.48s)]
*  He fails to take any action. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=207.6s)]
*  I don't think it's a fake. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=209.95999999999998s)]
*  I think it's just he's a very ineffective president. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=211.2s)]
*  The times we've talked before about the Israeli war, we've talked a lot about what their motive [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=215.4s)]
*  is. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=223.52s)]
*  Like what are they really after in this onslaught that has no end? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=224.52s)]
*  And we talked about the stated goal is to destroy Hamas, eliminate Hamas, make it no [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=228.20000000000002s)]
*  longer existing in the Gaza Strip. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=233.44s)]
*  Other Israeli officials obviously want, because they've said, a complete annexation by Israel [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=237.68s)]
*  of both the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=244.04000000000002s)]
*  They consider it part of greater Israel. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=245.64000000000001s)]
*  I think now there's starting to be a pretty big recognition that Israel isn't going to [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=247.64000000000001s)]
*  achieve any of those goals. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=252.88s)]
*  They're not going to eliminate Hamas. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=254.12s)]
*  There's no chance of that. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=256.16s)]
*  And they also have no plan for what will happen to who will govern Gaza after this is done [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=257.76s)]
*  when you have 2 million, 2.2 million Palestinians there. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=263.56s)]
*  How is Israel going to possibly manage that at the same time when you have them expanding [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=266.84000000000003s)]
*  their control of the West Bank? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=272.08s)]
*  It seems to me, I guess I'm wondering whether you agree, that a big part of the Israeli [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=273.84000000000003s)]
*  motive at this point is simply a desire for vengeance and bloodshed, kind of a hatred [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=278.16s)]
*  that has been accumulating against Palestinians in that country, a leadership that has encouraged [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=283.24s)]
*  that. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=289.68s)]
*  And then October 7th, understandably, like 9-11 provoked a lot of anger and rage and [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=290.68s)]
*  desire for bloodshed in the United States, provoked that as well, but it didn't endure [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=295.44s)]
*  for this long. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=299.12s)]
*  What are the Israelis doing in their mind? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=301.24s)]
*  What do you think is their thinking behind all of this? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=303.24s)]
*  I don't think it's simply vengeance and bloodshed. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=308.0s)]
*  I think it is calculated. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=312.52s)]
*  But like the calculations we talked about with regard to Ukraine, I think the calculations [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=314.48s)]
*  are wrong, but they're very clear calculations. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=321.1s)]
*  The calculations of the Israelis encouraged by both Trump and Biden is you can have it [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=325.96s)]
*  all. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=335.71999999999997s)]
*  You can continue to essentially be so-called greater Israel, meaning you don't have to [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=336.91999999999996s)]
*  really make any political concessions. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=343.64s)]
*  You can run an apartheid state. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=346.47999999999996s)]
*  essentially have control over the occupied Palestinian lands, and you can have peace [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=349.38s)]
*  with the Arab neighbors. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=356.38s)]
*  That was Trump's idea, the so-called Abraham Accords, and that is Biden's idea until today, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=359.06s)]
*  which is we can entice the Saudis by giving F-35s, by giving nuclear technology, by giving [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=368.9s)]
*  a defense agreement. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=377.56s)]
*  We can entice the Saudis to normalize relations with Israel despite what's happening right [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=379.28s)]
*  now, despite a genocide and despite everything. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=387.4s)]
*  Through all of these incentives, Israel becomes secure. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=390.71999999999997s)]
*  The Saudis are happy. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=397.24s)]
*  The Arab world's OK. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=398.79999999999995s)]
*  The losers are Palestine, and we get on with it. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=401.91999999999996s)]
*  That's the calculation. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=406.08s)]
*  I think it's not only cruel and immoral. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=408.44s)]
*  I think it's dead wrong. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=411.8s)]
*  I don't find these people very bright. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=416.08s)]
*  I have to just say it. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=418.64s)]
*  I don't think they calculate right. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=420.32s)]
*  I don't think they understand what they're doing. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=422.24s)]
*  I think it's an extraordinarily weak team and a very weak president, but I won't necessarily [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=425.59999999999997s)]
*  individual names, but these people running around to Riyadh and so forth and then announcing [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=434.76s)]
*  we're close to an agreement with the Saudis. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=439.64s)]
*  This is tactical stuff. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=442.32s)]
*  The thing that is different for you and for me, we actually think, my God, 50,000 people [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=444.35999999999996s)]
*  dead probably or 100,000 people dead. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=452.88s)]
*  Of course, the official counts 35,000, but we know that it's multiples of that because [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=455.91999999999996s)]
*  all the uncounted deaths, direct and indirect. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=461.8s)]
*  I don't think they count those numbers the way we do. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=466.52s)]
*  They don't even count 500,000 dead in Ukraine as all that big a deal. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=469.71999999999997s)]
*  I mean, after all, what's 500,000 people when we're talking about the stakes of global hegemony? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=475.15999999999997s)]
*  So I think one difference is the cruelty is completely normalized among these players [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=482.44s)]
*  who sit around as if they're playing a game of risk on the world map, and they don't find [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=491.64s)]
*  this so profoundly, profoundly awful, horrific, deadly the way they should and the way you and I [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=498.28s)]
*  do. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=509.4s)]
*  But I think this is the calculation that come on, why compromise? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=510.2s)]
*  I mean, the Arabs are close to accepting life as it is the Palestinians. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=515.48s)]
*  Well, this has been going on for decades. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=519.9599999999999s)]
*  And I think that like the other calculations, no, I don't think Saudi Arabia is going to [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=522.84s)]
*  suddenly agree on the basis of getting some F-35s to normalize relations with Israel. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=530.84s)]
*  They keep saying every week when the US somehow unofficially signals that, they say, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=537.24s)]
*  no, there has to be a Palestinian state. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=544.6s)]
*  We have the Arab peace initiative since 2002. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=547.08s)]
*  We have the Arab and Islamic leader statement from Riyadh last November, and we say it every time, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=551.0s)]
*  but you don't hear it. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=558.28s)]
*  And then the US again with Blinken, who's very weak and very pathetic, unfortunately, and not [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=559.72s)]
*  at the top of this game, saying, oh, we're going to negotiate. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=568.04s)]
*  And there are a few of them around negotiating. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=573.0s)]
*  So they're gambling the same way. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=575.4s)]
*  They don't count the Palestinian deaths as being some horrific fact. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=578.6800000000001s)]
*  Of course, they should, but they don't. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=585.8s)]
*  And that's what the gamble is. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=588.28s)]
*  The gamble is that we can get a normalization of relations with the major Arab states without [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=589.96s)]
*  a two-state solution. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=597.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=598.76s)]
*  You could almost tolerate it a little bit more if they were just sociopaths disregarding the value [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=599.32s)]
*  of life that they're ending if they were very cunning strategists. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=604.04s)]
*  But the fact that they're also a neft and incompetent in that makes it the worst of both worlds. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=607.4s)]
*  And the little time we have left, I want to ask you about China. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=613.08s)]
*  But before I get to that, I just need to ask you about the following, given that you've been [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=615.48s)]
*  around academia for a lot of your career. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=619.08s)]
*  You still are. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=622.44s)]
*  There's obviously a big controversy over campus protests that have broken out, including at your [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=623.64s)]
*  school, over people, young people, seeing all these images who do value these 35,000 lives at least. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=628.84s)]
*  And as you say, it's far more than that. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=637.4s)]
*  And they know it's coming. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=638.84s)]
*  And there has been a crackdown on their right to protest, on their right to speak, not people [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=641.72s)]
*  who are necessarily engaged in civil disobedience, but people who are just chanting things or who are [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=648.04s)]
*  a common frequent presence on American campuses. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=653.3199999999999s)]
*  What do you make of this? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=657.0799999999999s)]
*  It seems like that free speech and the right to organize and protest is being run rough shot over [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=661.4799999999999s)]
*  because the cause of shielding Israel is so important. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=667.0799999999999s)]
*  But you're closer to these campus protests than I. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=669.2399999999999s)]
*  So what do you make of what's been going on there? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=672.04s)]
*  Well, I'm very proud of the students. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=674.4399999999999s)]
*  They see an outrage of grim historic proportion and they're protesting. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=676.9200000000001s)]
*  And I'd be very worried if they weren't protesting. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=685.8000000000001s)]
*  We're watching a genocide take place and our students are protesting. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=689.32s)]
*  And I say, thank God they're protesting. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=693.4s)]
*  We're watching something absolutely horrible, the transpire. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=695.5600000000001s)]
*  And students are aroused across the country to protest this and to state their opposition. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=700.12s)]
*  This has caught the political class and the administrators of the universities completely [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=707.48s)]
*  off guard. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=713.88s)]
*  When you tell lies like our government does for a living and one of the lies is [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=715.4s)]
*  we support the two state solution, blah, blah, blah, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=722.2s)]
*  blah, you don't expect truth to appear. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=725.32s)]
*  And the fact that young people are aghast at Israel's actions is a shock to the political [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=731.24s)]
*  advisors, to Biden and his reelection, a shock to the Israel lobby. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=741.1600000000001s)]
*  How dare they? [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=745.88s)]
*  This is a pro-Israel country. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=746.6800000000001s)]
*  We've never heard from young people about this. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=748.84s)]
*  And the administrators are basically responding in a completely wrong way to the pressures [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=752.44s)]
*  from Congress and from their donors. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=762.0400000000001s)]
*  And they panicked and they did it all wrong. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=764.5200000000001s)]
*  And they have really profoundly ruptured one of the most important institutions of [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=768.36s)]
*  any country's life, which is its universities and young people who need an environment to be [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=778.44s)]
*  learned to be critical and to think critically and to understand what's happening in the world. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=788.6800000000001s)]
*  I was on a call today with university presidents around the world and one from New Zealand [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=795.48s)]
*  pointed out that in the New Zealand university law, this is a law, the universities are identified [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=802.36s)]
*  as the critics and conscience of society. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=809.5600000000001s)]
*  I thought how wonderful and how completely different from the American situation now where [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=813.48s)]
*  you have these dunderheads in Congress basically trying to break the university life and you have [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=819.72s)]
*  administrators doing their bidding for them. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=825.8000000000001s)]
*  So it's very sad for America and very dangerous and huge abuse of the students who are afraid, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=828.52s)]
*  who have been arrested, who have been expelled, who have been suspended for doing nothing more [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=836.28s)]
*  than speaking the truth and calling out the crimes of Israel and the United States, which is utterly [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=842.36s)]
*  complicit in this and gotten the police landing on their heads for what they've done. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=850.92s)]
*  I always conceived of universities, of academia as being the most important fashion to protect [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=859.16s)]
*  the right of dissent. I always thought that that was why professors have tenure, why there's [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=865.48s)]
*  academic freedom, precisely because that's the one place where we're going to allow dissent of all [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=870.12s)]
*  kinds to thrive in order to make sure we have open discourse. As far as the students are concerned, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=874.68s)]
*  I think one of the main reasons why they're so motivated is because they've seen what's going on [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=880.1999999999999s)]
*  in Gaza really for the first time because of social media, things like TikTok, and that's why [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=884.76s)]
*  the government again is so eager to take those platforms away because they're getting to see [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=889.16s)]
*  the truth and that's the one thing we can't have. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL19sPwhmsc&t=893.56s)]
