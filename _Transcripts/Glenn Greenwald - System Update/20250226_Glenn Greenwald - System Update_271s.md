# Glenn from Moscow: A Special Preview of Interview with Key Russian Analyst Aleksandr Dugin
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [February 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeAocvkCh-Q)
*  Welcome to a new episode of System Update. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeAocvkCh-Q&t=0.0s)]
*  As you can undoubtedly see, I am not in the studio. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeAocvkCh-Q&t=9.76s)]
*  Instead I am in Budapest. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeAocvkCh-Q&t=13.68s)]
*  You can probably see the landmark, one of the landmarks of Budapest, sitting on the [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeAocvkCh-Q&t=15.92s)]
*  Danube River over my left shoulder. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeAocvkCh-Q&t=19.64s)]
*  The reason I'm here is because I have been traveling the last several days. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeAocvkCh-Q&t=26.16s)]
*  That's why I wasn't very present last night on last night's show and won't be that much [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeAocvkCh-Q&t=28.88s)]
*  on tonight's either. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeAocvkCh-Q&t=32.44s)]
*  I've been traveling to do a bunch of different interviews. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeAocvkCh-Q&t=34.04s)]
*  Obviously there's a lot going on in Eastern Europe, in Russia, in response to all the [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeAocvkCh-Q&t=38.32s)]
*  flurry of new policies, new approaches, new narratives. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeAocvkCh-Q&t=44.08s)]
*  In Washington as a result of the new Trump administration, I spent the last several days [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeAocvkCh-Q&t=48.44s)]
*  in Moscow where I conducted several different interviews, one of which we are extremely [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeAocvkCh-Q&t=51.68s)]
*  excited to show you for tomorrow night. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeAocvkCh-Q&t=57.0s)]
*  That will be with one of the most influential and prominent professors in Russia, Professor [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeAocvkCh-Q&t=58.32s)]
*  Dugin. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeAocvkCh-Q&t=66.28s)]
*  It was a really wide ranging hour and 45 minute discussion. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeAocvkCh-Q&t=67.28s)]
*  We hope to show you that tonight. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeAocvkCh-Q&t=70.4s)]
*  It's not quite ready. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeAocvkCh-Q&t=71.4s)]
*  It'll be ready tomorrow night though. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeAocvkCh-Q&t=72.4s)]
*  I found it really fascinating. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeAocvkCh-Q&t=73.68s)]
*  Obviously as you undoubtedly know, there's an attempt to ensure we in the West never [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeAocvkCh-Q&t=77.0s)]
*  hear from what Russian voices almost immediately in the wake of the invasion of large numbers [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeAocvkCh-Q&t=82.72s)]
*  of Russian troops in February of 2022, the EU actually passed a law making it criminal, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeAocvkCh-Q&t=90.04s)]
*  illegal to platform Russian state media like RT and Sputnik. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeAocvkCh-Q&t=96.72s)]
*  It's always the case that when you hear from the other side, from different perspectives, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeAocvkCh-Q&t=102.52000000000001s)]
*  you hear the full plan of play of their views, not mediated through others, not summarized, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeAocvkCh-Q&t=107.4s)]
*  not caricatured. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeAocvkCh-Q&t=111.80000000000001s)]
*  It's extremely illuminating whether you agree with it, whether you disagree with it, you [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeAocvkCh-Q&t=113.96000000000001s)]
*  think the war is horrific, whatever your views are, there's still a huge journalistic value, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeAocvkCh-Q&t=116.96000000000001s)]
*  a huge intellectual value to understanding the perspectives of other people that we don't [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeAocvkCh-Q&t=122.28s)]
*  hear from. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeAocvkCh-Q&t=127.60000000000001s)]
*  I'm very excited to show you that tomorrow night. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeAocvkCh-Q&t=128.6s)]
*  I also was able to meet with Edward Snowden. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeAocvkCh-Q&t=129.6s)]
*  We didn't do an interview. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeAocvkCh-Q&t=133.56s)]
*  We might do one shortly, but I will speak with him, speak with a lot of other people. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeAocvkCh-Q&t=134.56s)]
*  I'm going to do the same here and we'll fill you in as we go. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeAocvkCh-Q&t=137.76s)]
*  Tomorrow night you can look for that interview with Professor Dugin. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeAocvkCh-Q&t=140.96s)]
*  I'm also going to have some discussions and thoughts about my trip so far, particularly [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeAocvkCh-Q&t=143.6s)]
*  about what it is that I heard in Moscow from Russian officials, Russian journalists, Russian [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeAocvkCh-Q&t=147.96s)]
*  activists with whom I met, with whom I was able to speak about the war in Ukraine, about [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeAocvkCh-Q&t=152.48000000000002s)]
*  the perspective of U.S. relations in light of Trump, about what the new Trump administration [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeAocvkCh-Q&t=158.08s)]
*  means for Russia, how the Russians are looking at the possibility of a resolution in the [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeAocvkCh-Q&t=162.28s)]
*  war in Ukraine, which may not be the same as what the United States is looking for or [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeAocvkCh-Q&t=167.32s)]
*  what the United States expects Russia to be looking for. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeAocvkCh-Q&t=170.6s)]
*  So we're going to put that on Locals for our Locals members. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeAocvkCh-Q&t=173.6s)]
*  And as you know, Locals is the community on which we rely, the members and supporters, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeAocvkCh-Q&t=176.36s)]
*  to support the independent journalism that we do here. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeAocvkCh-Q&t=180.48s)]
*  Every night you just click the join button right below the video player on the Rumble [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeAocvkCh-Q&t=183.08s)]
*  page and it will take you there. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeAocvkCh-Q&t=185.68s)]
*  Tonight we are excited to feature a always illuminating and entertaining Michael Tracy [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeAocvkCh-Q&t=187.64s)]
*  on the road series we showed you last night, a series of interviews he did at CPAC, which [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeAocvkCh-Q&t=193.24s)]
*  is the conservative conference that has become really the epicenter, not just of American [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeAocvkCh-Q&t=198.2s)]
*  right wing politics, but international right wing politics. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeAocvkCh-Q&t=202.6s)]
*  Tonight we have a variety of segments he was able to do there, including a debate on Ukraine, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeAocvkCh-Q&t=205.8s)]
*  a debate with several hardcore Trump supporters on a variety of different issues. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeAocvkCh-Q&t=211.6s)]
*  I think it's very good Michael Tracy content that you probably won't find anywhere else. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeAocvkCh-Q&t=215.4s)]
*  So that'll be for tonight. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeAocvkCh-Q&t=220.84s)]
*  Stay tuned for tomorrow night where we will have this exclusive and I think really eye-opening [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeAocvkCh-Q&t=222.51999999999998s)]
*  interview that I was able to do with Professor Dugan of Moscow. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeAocvkCh-Q&t=228.72s)]
*  And I really hope and encourage you to watch that. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeAocvkCh-Q&t=232.64s)]
*  I really enjoyed that interview. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeAocvkCh-Q&t=234.76s)]
*  A great deal. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeAocvkCh-Q&t=236.04s)]
