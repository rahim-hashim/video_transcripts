# JD Vance's Revealing Debate on X
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [April 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA)
*  You had an interesting exchange. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=0.0s)]
*  Was it today or yesterday with with JD Vance? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=8.92s)]
*  It was last night. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=11.68s)]
*  Last night. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=13.64s)]
*  So first of all, we could pull that up hopefully on the screen. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=14.64s)]
*  It was about the deportations that are going on and the apparent decision that it's totally [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  A lot of ordinary Americans don't have a whole lot of interest or investment in the technicalities [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=54.519999999999996s)]
*  of due process. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=59.879999999999995s)]
*  If they hear that this guy was an accused gang member and he was illegally in the country [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=60.879999999999995s)]
*  to begin with, then I don't think there's like a super majority of Americans who are [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=67.16s)]
*  going to be that concerned with like the manner in which he was expelled from the country. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=72.8s)]
*  Now having a penal colony that he goes to and he's maybe disappeared in for life without [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=79.6s)]
*  getting an opportunity to contest any claim against him, that might be a little bit different. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=84.47999999999999s)]
*  However, in terms of just getting illegal immigrants out of the country, I think the [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=90.11999999999999s)]
*  Republicans currently have that argument in their favor. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=94.24s)]
*  But anyway, you have this exchange with JD Vance first. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=97.63999999999999s)]
*  I wanted to ask you, what do you think of just the principle of the vice president debating [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=101.75999999999999s)]
*  media personalities on Twitter? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=108.02s)]
*  I think there's something useful about it. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=111.17999999999999s)]
*  People sometimes mock him for having the time to even do that. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=114.53999999999999s)]
*  Whereas I don't think there's anything inherently discrediting about engaging with people online. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=120.38s)]
*  Obviously, that's a platform that people debate all day every day. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=125.9s)]
*  So what do you think of just the concept of him engaging with you? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=131.14s)]
*  I think he might have done it once before, actually. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=134.42s)]
*  And the substance of the issue. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=137.33999999999997s)]
*  I think that for him, he sees himself as kind of like, he is the lawyer for the Trump administration. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=141.26s)]
*  He's the one who's going to be arguing their case in detail at intellectual level, legal [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=150.66s)]
*  level, historical levels, so on and so forth. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=154.94s)]
*  He's done this with a number of journalists. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=158.66s)]
*  He's done this with a number of politicians. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=160.7s)]
*  He's had back and forth with Ro Khanna, who's been targeting him more directly as well. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=162.54s)]
*  And I think that for him, it's also kind of probably a response to the actual powers of [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=167.73999999999998s)]
*  the vice presidency are pretty limited. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=174.29999999999998s)]
*  He doesn't really have to do that much other than break tie votes in the Senate if he has [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=176.62s)]
*  to, which he's had to before for nominees. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=181.1s)]
*  But what he can do is he has one of the most powerful soap boxes in the country. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=184.7s)]
*  He can speak his mind and he can make the case for the administration and so on and [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=190.34s)]
*  so forth. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=193.74s)]
*  So I think that's kind of how he's responding to things. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=194.74s)]
*  He's also a millennial. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=196.74s)]
*  I think he might be like two, three years older than me. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=197.74s)]
*  He's not that much older than me. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=200.5s)]
*  And I think he has always been someone who just reads voraciously and likes to be part [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=203.42000000000002s)]
*  of intellectual debate, even before he was formally involved in politics as a senator. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=208.14000000000001s)]
*  And so I think he's just naturally continuing to do it. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=212.98000000000002s)]
*  And I think if I had to guess, the Trump administration probably likes that he does it, right? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=215.54s)]
*  They feel like they have someone who's kind of like above Trump's level in terms of argumentation [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=219.0s)]
*  and like book smart intellect doing it. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=223.28s)]
*  So it's probably a pretty good fit for him to be doing that. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=226.32s)]
*  It's more useful than whatever Kamala Harris was doing. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=229.16s)]
*  Yeah, like you can't imagine Kamala Harris like engaging in like long back and forths [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=232.2s)]
*  with people online, right? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=237.72s)]
*  Because she wouldn't, she'd be too intimidated to do it and she wouldn't have thoughts about [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=239.16s)]
*  a lot of things. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=243.56s)]
*  She'd have staff doing it for her and blah, blah, blah. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=244.56s)]
*  It's different with him, right? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=246.2s)]
*  He's almost like a pundit himself, right? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=247.56s)]
*  Like he's just kind of controlling. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=250.44s)]
*  He was. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=251.44s)]
*  I mean, not almost. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=252.44s)]
*  He was. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=253.44s)]
*  I mean, that's how he gained his national profile. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=254.44s)]
*  He had a successful book and then he was brought on to lots of TV shows and things to talk [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=256.0s)]
*  about the book. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=260.6s)]
*  And then inevitably in 2016, he was asked about Trump and the dynamics around the election [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=261.6s)]
*  that year and he gained a punditry profile. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=266.32s)]
*  And that's what then served as the basis for him to seek to run for Senate in Ohio. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=270.34000000000003s)]
*  So yeah, this is kind of in some certain ways is like natural state. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=275.72s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think it's a development of his skill set as a, like you said, as a pundit [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=279.36s)]
*  who turned into a politician, but who still kind of retains some of those attitudes and [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=286.04s)]
*  some of the demeanors and so on and so forth. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=290.44000000000005s)]
*  So I think that he's going to continue to, I think that he's going to continue to do [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=293.24s)]
*  it. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=297.48s)]
*  I mean, I don't really see a number of downsides. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=298.48s)]
*  The only downsides would be if he strung out positions that aren't the Trump administration's [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=300.08000000000004s)]
*  positions and then he ended up like tweeting in them into having entirely different positions, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=304.36s)]
*  which he so far he hasn't. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=308.76s)]
*  He actually been fairly disciplined about that. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=309.76s)]
*  Kind of staying with the party line. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=312.76s)]
*  But yeah, last night. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=313.76s)]
*  How about the substance of the exchange? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=314.76s)]
*  Because let's pull that up on the screen if we can, because we have it ready. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=318.48s)]
*  But it's pretty interesting to see the vice president decided to debate you. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=322.52000000000004s)]
*  And so last night he was basically he was making an argument. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=328.16s)]
*  The administration's been getting a lot of flak because, as you all have covered on your [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=332.24s)]
*  show, they have been using a prison in El Salvador, which they are subsidizing through [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=335.91999999999996s)]
*  a contract to deport people. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=340.88s)]
*  A lot of those people who are being deported are not being given the even very narrow due [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=344.36s)]
*  process, meaning like a deportation proceeding before a judge, where they get some time to [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=349.56s)]
*  defend themselves. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=354.56s)]
*  Often these are very quick, like five minutes literally in some cases. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=355.56s)]
*  A lot of people have not gotten that. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=358.56s)]
*  And the concern is that some of them just don't even have criminal record in the country [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=359.71999999999997s)]
*  illegally. Why are they being sent to a prison? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=364.96s)]
*  Like can they be deported to some country, a country of origin, some of them not even [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=366.52s)]
*  Salvadorian? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=370.32s)]
*  And then one gentleman was actually even the administration's lawyers admitted that they [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=371.91999999999996s)]
*  were there was an administrative error in sending them there, like they didn't actually [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=375.24s)]
*  mean to do it. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=378.2s)]
*  So the question is like that went all the way up to the Supreme Court. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=379.47999999999996s)]
*  Supreme Court is like you need to facilitate his return to the United States. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=382.71999999999997s)]
*  Administration will not do it. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=386.32s)]
*  They will not try to bring him back. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=387.4s)]
*  They're not even ask the president of El Salvador, bring him back. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=388.84s)]
*  And then the president of El Salvador is like, I can't bring him back if they don't want [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=391.56s)]
*  him. You know, like, you know, they're both kind of like pointing the finger at each [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=394.08s)]
*  other. So anyway, Vance, I think, has been seeing all this criticism aimed at the [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=396.44s)]
*  administration. And so he was like, look, dude, Biden brought in so many people. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=401.88s)]
*  There is no way that we can give all those people like this standard of due process that [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=406.76s)]
*  our critics are talking about. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=412.44s)]
*  Right. It would take too long. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=413.56s)]
*  It's inefficient. He cited a number 20 million. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=414.67999999999995s)]
*  I don't really believe 20 million people in the country legally. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=417.0s)]
*  I think that's really inflated. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=419.48s)]
*  But whatever the number is. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=421.08s)]
*  So I engage with them. I was like, dude, like, I do think that, like, you know, if you're [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=423.16s)]
*  accusing someone of a crime, a trial is appropriate. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=426.96s)]
*  Right. And and which is like at one point, it's usually not a good. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=429.6s)]
*  At one point, J.D. Vance, this is a few weeks ago, said that this guy was a convicted [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=435.12s)]
*  MS 13 number, implying that he had been convicted of a crime associated with his [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=441.0s)]
*  purported membership in this gang, which was not the case at all. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=446.96s)]
*  No, I mean, first of all, you can't be convicted of being in a gang. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=452.12s)]
*  It's not a crime inherently. Right. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=455.12s)]
*  What happened is an informant had accused him of being part of MS 13. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=456.88s)]
*  Never really went anywhere. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=459.91999999999996s)]
*  He did. Of course, did not convict him of any crime. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=461.03999999999996s)]
*  There are a lot of holes in what the informant had said. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=464.56s)]
*  And oftentimes police get things wrong. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=466.56s)]
*  That's fine. But that's why you have due process. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=468.59999999999997s)]
*  Right. And then, like, you know, Stephen Miller has called him, I think, a terrorist. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=470.79999999999995s)]
*  I don't know anyone. He's terrorized. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=474.56s)]
*  He's never been convicted of bullying and something, opportunity. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=476.92s)]
*  Buckeye called him a terrorist, too. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=479.72s)]
*  Buckeye said at the White House meeting with Trump, what am I supposed to do? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=481.88s)]
*  Smuggle a terrorist into the United States. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=485.72s)]
*  As like disclaiming any ability. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=489.88s)]
*  To facilitate, as the Supreme Court ordered [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=493.48s)]
*  the return of this individual to the United States. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=497.96s)]
*  So, yeah, there's some irony in that a lot of these MAGA people will claim [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=500.96000000000004s)]
*  that they are these big opponents of Bush and Cheney, that the spies Bush and Cheney. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=506.32s)]
*  And yet they're incredibly eager to deploy like the rhetorical [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=511.28000000000003s)]
*  and legal architecture of the war on terror period by just declaring [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=516.36s)]
*  whoever they want to be a terrorist and then any due process protections [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=521.2s)]
*  and civil liberties that might be afforded to that person dissipate. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=526.12s)]
*  So they're actually, in a way, the proper successors to Bush Cheney [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=530.72s)]
*  in their capricious use of this terrorism label. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=537.52s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, my counter argument to Vance was that, you know, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=541.48s)]
*  basically that he's saying it's inefficient, right? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=544.64s)]
*  Because there's two different things around here. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=546.76s)]
*  OK, one, like if someone's a terrorist or a criminal or like [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=548.6800000000001s)]
*  there's, you know, some kind of crime. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=552.44s)]
*  Yeah, you have to put them through a trial like Laken Reilly's killer, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=555.48s)]
*  the murderer in that case in Georgia. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=558.36s)]
*  They cite Laken Reilly all the time. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=560.5600000000001s)]
*  He did get a trial, right? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=561.88s)]
*  And he was convicted. He was sent to prison. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=562.9200000000001s)]
*  And I don't recall anyone in the state of Georgia, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=564.5600000000001s)]
*  the most considered Republicans, saying, no, he shouldn't be afforded a trial. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=566.7600000000001s)]
*  We should just throw him away. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=569.5600000000001s)]
*  Knock out the key. Like everyone thought it was common sense. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=570.96s)]
*  Yeah, someone's accused of a crime, sent him on a trial. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=573.32s)]
*  So that's one thing. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=575.36s)]
*  If you're actually accusing people of these serious crimes, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=576.6800000000001s)]
*  which they are like every day, like Stephen Miller, Bukele, blah, blah, blah. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=578.84s)]
*  The other thing is like deportation. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=582.6s)]
*  For a deportation, you don't usually get a jury trial, but you do get a judge. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=584.12s)]
*  And the judge looks at your case, looks at the facts. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=587.72s)]
*  OK, you stay, leave, whatever. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=590.32s)]
*  Those are often very quick. They can be like a few minutes long. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=592.2s)]
*  So it's not like it would take a century to just allow that basic amount [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=594.52s)]
*  of due process for these people. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=598.28s)]
*  And then, yeah, like in the case of when you're accusing people of crimes, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=599.9200000000001s)]
*  you actually have to prove it through a trial. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=602.52s)]
*  You can't just call someone a terrorist or so on and so forth. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=604.04s)]
*  And so, you know, the Vance Miller argument, Homan also, the guy at ICE, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=607.72s)]
*  is basically that takes too long. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=614.0s)]
*  And I'm like, you can make the argument for anything in government, right? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=615.44s)]
*  Like it takes too long for Congress to make a law. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=618.24s)]
*  So why not just let the president make the laws, right? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=619.9200000000001s)]
*  It takes too long to debate where they're going to war. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=622.32s)]
*  Why doesn't the president just go to war? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=624.72s)]
*  I mean, that's kind of what we do now. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=625.8800000000001s)]
*  Congress barely votes on wars that we can impart it, right? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=627.48s)]
*  So like this devolution of power towards the top, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=630.24s)]
*  you know, it's kind of like a road to tyranny. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=633.44s)]
*  And one of the arguments that's actually in favor of a tyrant, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=635.2s)]
*  and usually what tyrants argue is that having these emergency powers [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=639.0s)]
*  help speed things up so they can respond quickly, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=643.4s)]
*  it makes things more efficient. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=646.52s)]
*  You know, they can actually tackle a huge problem [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=648.12s)]
*  that all these checks and balances and bureaucracy and red tape wouldn't let them do. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=650.0799999999999s)]
*  And they're doing the exact same thing here now. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=653.68s)]
*  And actually, the quote that Vance told me, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=655.28s)]
*  and people got quoting this back to me after he did it, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=657.1999999999999s)]
*  was that I was hiding behind due process. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=659.52s)]
*  I was like hiding behind due process. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=661.48s)]
*  It does kind of sound like something a dictator would say. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=663.48s)]
*  And I would think I would hope that JD would not would realize [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=666.4s)]
*  the problem with saying something like that. But. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=669.6s)]
*  Well, yeah, I mean, they're affording Trump or Trump is arrogating to himself. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=673.52s)]
*  So many emergency powers now that people lose track. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kVUyb1fIA&t=678.48s)]
