# Russia's "PEARL HARBOR"?!
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [June 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k)
*  I mean, we can't cut your break here. I mean, can we go like a couple of days where we're [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=0.0s)]
*  not on a knife's edge or we're not like on the brink of some kind of cladica cataclysm? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=10.48s)]
*  Maybe I have a catastrophizing bias or something just given how tumultuous these past few years [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=19.22s)]
*  have been politically and geopolitically, but it seems like now things have really heated [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=25.76s)]
*  up and there's like a multi-directional disaster looming everywhere you look. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=31.720000000000002s)]
*  Today, media outlets, pundits, TV commentators, etc. were thrilled that there was an unprecedented [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=44.4s)]
*  Ukrainian attack within Russia, deep inside Russia, thousands of kilometers. Not just [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=56.96s)]
*  any old Ukrainian attack because they've been doing this fairly consistently for a number [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=62.94s)]
*  of years now. Their drone technology has obviously gotten more advanced. They are able to strike [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=66.78s)]
*  Russian infrastructure even in far-flung areas of Russia that in the early portion [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=72.78s)]
*  of the war would not have been foreseen as a realistic target for Ukraine, just if for [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=78.22s)]
*  no other reason but geographic distance. But now things have shifted quite dramatically. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=89.42s)]
*  Ukraine was able to successfully attack, we're told, a Russian airbase in Siberia, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=98.3s)]
*  which take a look at a map. Note the distance between Siberia in the middle of Russia, a [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=110.46s)]
*  remote area that most Russians probably wouldn't even be overly familiar with because they're [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=118.66s)]
*  in the European Russia or the West. A long ways for Ukraine, but a Russian airbase in [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=125.38s)]
*  Siberia that houses Russia's nuclear-capable warplanes or at least a significant number [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=135.5s)]
*  of Russia's nuclear-capable warplanes was hit by this incredibly audacious, it would [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=146.54s)]
*  seem, Ukrainian drone attack where they stuck in their drones and through some sort of subterfuge. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=153.3s)]
*  Now Russia has lost a decent number of its most prized or of its most important nuclear-capable [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=163.74s)]
*  warplanes. Russia's nuclear triad is being subject to extreme severe attacks. It wasn't [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=176.18s)]
*  just in Siberia, it was simultaneously in a bunch of different parts of the country. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=188.26000000000002s)]
*  Even Russia, which is kind of rare, acknowledged through its Ministry of Defense that what [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=193.98000000000002s)]
*  it calls the Kiev regime carried out what Russia calls a terrorist attack against these [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=200.06s)]
*  airfields and it probably played down the extent of the damage somewhat and maybe Ukraine is [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=204.56s)]
*  exaggerating the extent of the damage because obviously we're in a fog of war and each warring [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=211.36s)]
*  party is communicating to advance its own interests. But everybody seems to agree, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=216.24s)]
*  including even Russia, who was the recipient of this attack, that there was an extremely [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=224.68s)]
*  unusual and damaging attack yesterday. So here's what Politico said this morning. I don't know if [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=231.84s)]
*  you all are old enough or young enough or crazy enough or goofy enough to subscribe or be familiar [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=241.6s)]
*  with this thing called the Politico Playbook. This was like one of the innovators of a daily [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=252.88s)]
*  political newsletter where the savviest pundits at Politico would aggregate everything going on [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=262.52s)]
*  in the DC insider world and have a little daily sort of cheat sheet that you would wake up at [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=269.52s)]
*  five in the morning and read first thing. Everybody would read it as like this communal exercise to [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=276.32s)]
*  know that you are inducted into the DC insider circles and you're aware of what's on the day's [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=281.92s)]
*  agenda. But anyway, I'm over explaining the Politico Playbook. I just want to point out that [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=289.8s)]
*  their title today was Russia's Pearl Harbor. This was the title of the Politico Playbook [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=294.32s)]
*  newsletter today. Now, it almost seems like they're trying to be cheeky or they're trying [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=307.08s)]
*  to be kind of funny or they're trying to be lighthearted. Let's, for the sake of argument, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=314.4s)]
*  as a thought experiment, assume that whatever happened yesterday actually is akin to Pearl [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=325.0s)]
*  Harbor or is analogous to Pearl Harbor. Let's say it's just like 10% or 20% as severe as what Pearl [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=333.8s)]
*  Harbor was to the United States in 1941. I think the nature of the analogy is kind of confused, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=347.84000000000003s)]
*  but if we're talking about just a sneak attack on an unsuspecting target that drastically altered [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=356.0s)]
*  the trajectory of a war, then if the Pearl Harbor analogy holds, what we should expect is for World [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=368.4s)]
*  War III to be coming soon. Obviously, when Japan attacked the United States in December 1941 at [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=377.2s)]
*  Pearl Harbor, the European war had been underway for two years, over two years. The United States [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=385.0s)]
*  was not yet a full-fledged official declared combatant in the war, although it was playing a [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=399.12s)]
*  supplementary role with the Allied powers through land lease and through naval convoys and through [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=404.92s)]
*  intelligence sharing and various other things. But then Pearl Harbor comes along and the United [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=418.36s)]
*  States, of course, as we all know, declares war on both Japan and Germany. Now, the analogy can't [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=426.6s)]
*  quite hold in terms of the context of Russia being attacked by Ukraine, even in a dramatic, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=439.12s)]
*  spectacular, unexpected fashion, and have that be likened neatly to Pearl Harbor. But it's just kind [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=444.24s)]
*  of like a vague expression of the gravity of the incident. Then what's with all the celebrating? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=451.96s)]
*  What's with all the frenzied anticipation? Why is this a big joke to people? Am I crazy? If you're [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=460.28s)]
*  saying this is Pearl Harbor and Russia's going to react in such a way that it would be comparable [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=470.79999999999995s)]
*  to how the United States reacted after it was attacked, then we're all in for some dark times, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=476.84s)]
*  aren't we? And Russia's the world's leading nuclear superpower. Some of its strategic nuclear-equipped [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=487.88s)]
*  bombers might have been taken out of service in the drone strike yesterday, but Russia still got [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=498.12s)]
*  plenty of other elements to its nuclear triad that it could theoretically employ. So there's a weird [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=507.44s)]
*  phenomenon that I'm detecting that people are sort of a nerd or numb to this chronic nuclear risk [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=517.76s)]
*  associated with the Ukraine conflict. If I had told you, I don't know, three, four, five years ago, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=525.12s)]
*  that it would come to pass that a client state, armed, funded, subsidized, operationally enabled [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=532.2s)]
*  by the United States, meaning Ukraine, would have the ability to attack a strategic nuclear bomber [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=541.8s)]
*  base in Siberia, you might think to yourself, gee, that seems pretty startling. That seems like maybe [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=551.64s)]
*  a bit worrisome. Does that mean that we are on the precipice of some kind of nuclear conflagration? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=567.08s)]
*  We should probably check it out. And if so, take whatever steps are within our capacity to mitigate [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=574.6s)]
*  the apparent nuclear risk. But that's just not a thought that seems to occur to very many people [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=583.0s)]
*  anymore, especially if you are going by the conventional mainline coverage. So take a look, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=591.8000000000001s)]
*  if you haven't seen it, here is just a clip of the drone attacks, one of many that got [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=600.8s)]
*  circulated on Telegram yesterday. It's... Right, so is that Pearl Harbor? Might be a little bit of an [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=605.76s)]
*  exaggeration, but it seems like people are chomping at the bit for it to be Pearl Harbor, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=632.96s)]
*  so then we could all get involved in some kind of global cataclysm. It is kind of a sick impulse [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=637.44s)]
*  that I think goes too under examined. Thanks for watching this clip from System Update, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ7SRGufR0k&t=643.84s)]
