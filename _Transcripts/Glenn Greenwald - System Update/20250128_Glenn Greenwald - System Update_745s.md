# U.S. Journalist Ali Abunimah Arrested in Switzerland for Criticizing Israel
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc)
*  One of the topics we have been covering most over the last year or so is the very steady [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=0.0s)]
*  and aggressive attacks on free speech in the West, including the United States in an effort [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=12.0s)]
*  to shield Israel from growing criticisms, especially as the evidence of what they really [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=17.22s)]
*  did in Gaza begins to emerge. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=22.8s)]
*  There's going to be a lot more criticism and horror about what Israel did in the West and [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=24.88s)]
*  therefore a lot more attempts to repress and silence its critics and to even not just [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=28.48s)]
*  stigmatize but criminalize its speech. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=34.16s)]
*  And we've gone over so many instances where people have been fired en masse, where laws [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=36.16s)]
*  have been proposed and even implemented in the United States, executive orders that are [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  designed to attack core free speech rights in order to silence Israel's harshest critics [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=46.2s)]
*  and people who are defenders of the Palestinian cause. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  Last October we interviewed Ali Abunimah, who is a longtime critic of Israel. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=55.68s)]
*  He's an American citizen who runs a website called the Electronic Intifada that reports [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=62.88s)]
*  very critically on Israel. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=67.88s)]
*  And we interviewed him in October because his colleague had been the subject of a very [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=71.48s)]
*  aggressive search by the British where they seized all of his telephones and computers, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=76.8s)]
*  obviously investigating his criticism of Israel. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=83.84s)]
*  And then Abunimah himself this weekend went to Switzerland at the invitation of Swiss [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=87.12s)]
*  citizens to participate in a conference on the war in Gaza. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=92.12s)]
*  And when he got to the airport he was detained and questioned, he was released, but then [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=95.72s)]
*  he was arrested the next day and held for two nights with no charges of any kind, obviously [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=99.16s)]
*  in retaliation for his speech, speaking on Israel, his critical speaking on Israel and [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=104.32s)]
*  his defense of the Palestinian cause, which exemplifies just how extreme these assaults [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=110.24s)]
*  on free speech in the West are becoming in order to protect this one foreign country [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=115.32s)]
*  on the other side of the world. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=118.72s)]
*  Here was his site, the Electronic Intifada on Friday, E.I.'s Ali Abunimah arrested in [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=120.84s)]
*  Switzerland. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=128.16s)]
*  The Electronic Intifada's executive director, Ali Abunimah, was arrested by Swiss police [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=129.16s)]
*  ahead of a speaking event in Zurich on Saturday afternoon when he arrived at Zurich airport [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=134.07999999999998s)]
*  on Friday. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=137.84s)]
*  He was questioned by police for an hour before being allowed to enter the country. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=139.04s)]
*  Abunimah's arrest appears to be part of a growing backlash from Western governments [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=142.84s)]
*  against expressions of solidarity with the Palestinian people. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=146.96s)]
*  Earlier today the Swiss authorities finally released him and then deported him from the [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=151.08s)]
*  country. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=157.44s)]
*  There you see the Electronic Intifada's headline, Switzerland Deports, E.I.'s Ali Abunimah. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=158.44s)]
*  Abunimah himself appeared after three full days of being in detention and then arrest [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=164.04s)]
*  in prison and told the story of what happened. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=169.67999999999998s)]
*  He said the following, quote, on Monday evening I was brought to, actually he first said, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=173.2s)]
*  I'm free, I wrote this on the plane and I'm posting it just hours after landing in Istanbul. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=179.2s)]
*  On Monday evening I was brought to Zurich airport in handcuffs in a small metal cage [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=184.16s)]
*  inside a windowless prison van and led all the way to the plane by police. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=188.72s)]
*  It is after three days and two nights in a Swiss prison, cut off from communication [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=193.04s)]
*  with the outside world in a cell, 24 hours a day with one cellmate not even permitted [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=196.92s)]
*  to contact my family. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=201.48s)]
*  On Saturday in a police interview in the presence of my lawyer they accused me of, quote, offending [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=203.35999999999999s)]
*  against Swiss law without ever telling me what crime I had committed in Switzerland or [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=207.39999999999998s)]
*  listing any other charges. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=211.76s)]
*  As far as I know I have not been charged with any crime whatsoever and I was held in, quote, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=213.23999999999998s)]
*  administrative detention. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=217.32s)]
*  All of this was after I was abducted off the street around 1.30 p.m. on Saturday while [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=218.96s)]
*  on my way to the Palestine teach-in by undercover agents handcuffed, forced into an unmarked [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=223.32000000000002s)]
*  car and sped straight to a prison. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=227.8s)]
*  My quote crime? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=230.16s)]
*  Being a journalist who speaks up for Palestine and against Israel's genocide and settler [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=231.56s)]
*  colonial savagery and those who aid and abet it. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=236.60000000000002s)]
*  I came to Switzerland at the invitation of Swiss citizens to talk about justice for Palestine, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=239.8s)]
*  to talk about accountability for a genocide in which Switzerland too is complicit. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=244.08s)]
*  Now let me just say again, this is an American citizen. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=249.52s)]
*  He was born in the United States, has lived in the United States his whole life as an [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=253.68s)]
*  American citizen. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=256.16s)]
*  He's a journalist and if any other American citizen on any other issue had been arrested [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=257.16s)]
*  in Switzerland and then kept in a prison cell, cut off from the outside world for three days [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=264.6s)]
*  and two nights, most Americans would be up in arms. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=270.66s)]
*  But as we well know by now, when it comes to free speech, when it comes to American [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=273.86s)]
*  citizens, people who claim so much to believe in both, so many of them have a gigantic Israel [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=280.46000000000004s)]
*  exception so that they're overruling not only to overlook this but create justifications [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=286.3s)]
*  for it. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=290.70000000000005s)]
*  Because while they weigh the banner of free speech and American patriotism and American [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=292.74s)]
*  first and all that, they're much higher and supreme causes Israel and everything else [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=295.78s)]
*  is subordinated to it. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=300.73999999999995s)]
*  And that's why we've seen so many people who got rich off waving the banner of free speech, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=302.9s)]
*  of branding themselves America first advocates and censorship opponents, either tolerate [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=307.17999999999995s)]
*  or justify or even cheer the withering assault on free speech in the West in order to protect [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=312.97999999999996s)]
*  Israel over the last year. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=317.85999999999996s)]
*  Here from I-24 News yesterday, the state counselor and the head of the Department of Security [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=320.34s)]
*  in Switzerland, Mario Fair, justified the decision to detain him to the newspaper NZZ, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=325.62s)]
*  quote, we do not want an Islamist Jew hater who calls for violence in Switzerland. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=331.58s)]
*  The entry ban was issued by the Fed poll, the federal police officer following a request [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=337.06s)]
*  from Zurich authorities. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=341.22s)]
*  And that is somebody with a long history of advocating for Israel. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=343.94s)]
*  And so there's no question that Abunima's advocacy for Palestine, his criticisms of [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=350.32s)]
*  Israel, are directly linked to the reason he was detained. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=356.32s)]
*  They're saying we don't want a Jew hater here in Switzerland. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=359.71999999999997s)]
*  A, being the same exact thing as if somebody was opposed to affirmative action and they [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=363.68s)]
*  got arrested in Switzerland and someone said we don't want a racist here in Switzerland, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=369.12s)]
*  somebody believes there are two genders and they go to a European country and get arrested [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=372.8s)]
*  and they say we don't want a transphobe here, somebody who isn't citing violence against [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=377.6s)]
*  trans people here, conservatives would be up in arms about it, especially if it weren't [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=380.84s)]
*  American citizen. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=384.56s)]
*  But because the issue here is a view that so many conservatives, especially pro-Israel [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=387.04s)]
*  ones, strongly dislike, which is a criticism of this one sacred foreign country, you won't [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=392.28s)]
*  hear many of them, if any, standing up in protest. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=397.44s)]
*  And every time I've talked about this, every time others have talked about it, I've seen [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=402.32s)]
*  a lot of justifications for it, unsurprisingly, the same way you do for censorship throughout [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=405.4s)]
*  the West directed at any other Israel critic. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=409.4s)]
*  Here is the incident I mentioned from October, also reported by the Electronic Intifada UK [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=413.59999999999997s)]
*  police raid the home and seize devices of EI's Eiza Winstanley. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=418.52s)]
*  And then October 18th we had Ali Abunimah on to talk about the erosion of free speech [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=425.03999999999996s)]
*  as evidence by that invasion by the British police of his colleague's home, his journalist [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=432.1s)]
*  a colleague's home, and obviously he didn't know at the time that he too would be victimized [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=437.26000000000005s)]
*  by it in a much worse case, but here is part of what he told us. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=441.1s)]
*  Yeah, so this happened on Thursday, October 17th. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=446.34000000000003s)]
*  Eiza got a knock on his door just before 6 a.m. London time, he lives in London, and [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=452.66s)]
*  there were 10 officers from the counter terrorism division of the Metropolitan Police. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=461.02s)]
*  That's the main police force in the UK. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=467.65999999999997s)]
*  And they served him with two search warrants, one for his house and one for his vehicle [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=471.38s)]
*  to seize all electronic devices connected with his journalism. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=477.7s)]
*  I mean, this should be a massive scandal. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=483.26s)]
*  You have this incomfortably devastating war that the West has paid for and armed that [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=487.96s)]
*  Israel has carried out in Gaza. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=494.12s)]
*  Love that war, hate that war, there's no denying that it's a polarizing topic that merits all [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=497.35999999999996s)]
*  sorts of intense debate. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=502.47999999999996s)]
*  And at the same time you have a growing framework of repression and censorship designed to shield [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=504.12s)]
*  Israel and punish those who believe that Israel's war was criminal or a war crime. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=510.84s)]
*  And as the evidence emerged of what Israel really did there, as the horrors become even [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=520.56s)]
*  more evident, this repression is only going to increase. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=524.36s)]
*  And we've seen extreme examples. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=527.6s)]
*  Over the last year, just as a couple reminders from Reuters in April of 2024, police shut [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=530.8399999999999s)]
*  down pro-Palestinian gathering in Germany over hate speech fears. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=535.0799999999999s)]
*  Both France and Germany actually at the very beginning banned pro-Palestinian protests [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=539.56s)]
*  even though pro-Israel protests were still permitted. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=545.0s)]
*  Here from the BBC, October 2023, French police break up pro-Palestinian demonstration after [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=547.1999999999999s)]
*  a ban on pro-Palestinian protests. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=553.88s)]
*  So you have entire Western countries banning any demonstration of pro-Palestinian expression [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=556.52s)]
*  and sentiments or criticism of Israel. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=563.0799999999999s)]
*  In the U.S. you've had efforts to shut down student protest movements, a radically expanded [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=565.6s)]
*  definition of anti-Semitism adopted by the U.S. House of Representatives and as we reported [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=570.72s)]
*  last week, Harvard, to all but outlaw, really to outlaw a whole wide array of common criticisms [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=574.24s)]
*  of Israel. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=580.9200000000001s)]
*  And as I keep saying, as a free speech advocate my entire life, first as a lawyer, then as [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=581.9200000000001s)]
*  a journalist, it's bad enough when you lose your free speech rights because your own government [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=587.4s)]
*  says it's too dangerous to your country or to your national security or to social stability [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=595.56s)]
*  to permit free speech. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=600.88s)]
*  That we're in the middle of a crisis, we have to curb free speech, we heard that during [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=601.88s)]
*  World War I and World War II and during the war on terror, that's bad enough. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=605.1199999999999s)]
*  But when you're being told, and not just told but when it's happening, that you have to [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=610.64s)]
*  lose your free speech rights because some foreign country doesn't want to be criticized [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=613.52s)]
*  and they have enough influence inside your countries to make those criticisms illegal [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=619.16s)]
*  and to deprive you and rob you of the fundamental rights that you have guaranteed by your own [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=624.0799999999999s)]
*  constitution because that foreign government has enough influence to erode free speech [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=628.92s)]
*  so that it can shield itself from criticism. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=634.28s)]
*  That becomes extra dangerous and extra repellent and extra offensive and this latest arrest [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=636.24s)]
*  of an American journalist in Switzerland is only but the latest of a long series of cases, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=641.9599999999999s)]
*  almost all of which we've reported over the last year and three months. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=646.4s)]
*  That exemplifies exactly that dangerous trend. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=649.88s)]
*  There is evidence that suggests that drinking two to three cups in the morning could slash [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=654.92s)]
*  your risk of death by 29% and cut your chance of heart complications by nearly half. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=659.52s)]
*  But that's not the only benefit you get from your coffee. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=665.24s)]
*  It also could be helpful in fighting censorship while tasting excellent. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCtjDu7yXdc&t=668.4799999999999s)]
