# Interview: Harvard Grad SUING SCHOOL, Alleging Campus Antisemitism
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [September 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA)
*  Shabbos Kestembaum is a self-described Jewish-American activist. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=0.0s)]
*  He came to public prominence earlier this year as one of the leading voices, accusing [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=10.0s)]
*  Harvard, the school he attends, and other Ivy League universities of being pervasively [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=14.36s)]
*  anti-Semitic and failing to protect Jewish students. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=18.6s)]
*  In July, he delivered a primetime address at the Republican National Convention announcing [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=21.92s)]
*  that he was supporting Donald Trump based on many of those issues. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=26.28s)]
*  And he is also now a plaintiff suing Harvard in a lawsuit brought into federal court in [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=29.64s)]
*  Massachusetts alleging that Harvard, quote, has become a bastion of rampant anti-Jewish [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=33.56s)]
*  hatred and harassment and that college administrators failed to fulfill their duty of care to keep [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=38.84s)]
*  Jewish students safe. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=44.0s)]
*  And we are very happy to have him here to discuss all of this and more. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=45.0s)]
*  Shabbos, good evening. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=49.0s)]
*  It's great to see you. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=50.0s)]
*  Thanks for coming on. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=51.0s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=52.0s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=53.0s)]
*  So let me start with the lawsuit that you brought in January of this year against Harvard. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=54.48s)]
*  There's a lot of... [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=61.24s)]
*  It's a pretty long complaint and there's a lot of grievances that are expressed about [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=62.24s)]
*  things going on at the Harvard campus that you think are bad or inappropriate. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=66.08s)]
*  But it is a lawsuit as well. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=70.44s)]
*  And therefore, the allegation has to be that Harvard had a legal obligation to take certain [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=72.72s)]
*  steps to protect Jewish students or combat anti-Semitism that it failed to take. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=76.88s)]
*  Can you just identify, say, two or three of the measures that you believe Harvard administrators [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=81.76s)]
*  had an obligation to take that they failed to take? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=87.04s)]
*  Happily. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=90.04s)]
*  So I'll give you one quick anecdote. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=91.04s)]
*  There was a staff member who challenged me to debate him as to whether Jews were behind [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=93.84s)]
*  9-11. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=97.48s)]
*  That was after he had vandalized all of our hostage posters that we will receive permission [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=98.48s)]
*  to post where he said that Jews did 9-11, that Jews are friends with Jeffrey Epstein [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=102.58000000000001s)]
*  on Kfir B'Bos, who's the now two-year-old baby being held hostage in Gaza. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=107.0s)]
*  He had written, his head is still on. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=110.76s)]
*  Where is the evidence? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=112.52000000000001s)]
*  So I, of course, don't respond to that email. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=113.56s)]
*  Couple hours later, he's posting on his social media a video of him waving a machete with [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=115.76s)]
*  a couple of screenshots saying that he has a plan to take down the Zionist mafia. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=120.44s)]
*  He wants to fight. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=124.24000000000001s)]
*  A month later, he says that he has a posse that's coming after more than blood. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=125.24000000000001s)]
*  So I frantically email, I frantically call, I request to meet with really anyone at Harvard [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=129.72s)]
*  because you have to remember, this is a staff member. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=134.32s)]
*  He knew where I lived because of the Harvard directory. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=136.42000000000002s)]
*  He had access to campus. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=139.0s)]
*  So I asked Harvard, what are you going to do to discipline this professor and more fundamentally [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=141.08s)]
*  make sure that it can't harm me or other Jewish students? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=145.32s)]
*  To this day, Harvard has not responded to a single one of my emails or my phone calls. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=147.68s)]
*  That's pretty deliberately indifferent. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=152.16s)]
*  And I can't imagine that any other minority group would be treated with the contempt, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=153.84s)]
*  the disregard, and the disdain that Harvard treats its Jewish students. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=157.84s)]
*  And I'll give you one last quick example, but again, we could delve more into it later. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=160.92000000000002s)]
*  Harvard was ranked by the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expressions. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=165.04s)]
*  248th out of 248 universities when it came to free speech, they routinely rescind controversial [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=168.12s)]
*  speakers. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=173.6s)]
*  They actually unaccepted 12 students who had posted sexist memes in a WhatsApp group. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=174.6s)]
*  And when a noted anti-Semite, Muhammad El-Kurd, was invited, for the very first time, Harvard [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=180.20000000000002s)]
*  said, well, he is a First Amendment right and we want to engage in controversial ideas. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=184.36s)]
*  Well, that's fine if that's how Harvard always played the game, but they've never played [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=187.6s)]
*  the game that way. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=191.04000000000002s)]
*  So, you know, deliberate indifference and creating a double standard when it comes to [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=192.04000000000002s)]
*  Jewish students. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=194.76s)]
*  So, to start with that first point, I realize obviously that speech is offensive to a lot [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=195.76s)]
*  of people to say that, you know, we want to raise a knife against the Zionist state, which [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=200.92s)]
*  is the Israeli government. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=205.84s)]
*  Obviously, we're acting to the bombing of Gaza on October 7th. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=207.67999999999998s)]
*  But in general, the idea of academia and college campuses and professors and tenure and academic [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=211.95999999999998s)]
*  freedom is to be able to express any and all views where that's the one place where there's [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=218.72s)]
*  not supposed to be a prohibited idea or thought where everything is permitted to be questioned [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=223.48000000000002s)]
*  and nothing is taboo. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=227.84s)]
*  Do you think that Harvard in this case should have but failed to say discipline or fire [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=229.0s)]
*  that staff member because of the expression of those ideas that you dislike? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=234.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=238.72s)]
*  So, I'm totally with you, Glenn. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=239.72s)]
*  The Carl Sagan line of the cure for fallacious argument is a better argument, not the suppression [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=242.0s)]
*  of ideas. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=247.04000000000002s)]
*  I'm totally in favor of a university and a culture that really values free speech, the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=248.04s)]
*  intellectual discourse and the academic rigor. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=253.16s)]
*  The problem is Harvard University has never really cared about that. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=256.0s)]
*  So, if they want to play the game like the University of Chicago that all speech is protected [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=259.64s)]
*  and you can really invite anyone you want, then fine. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=263.52s)]
*  I really wouldn't have a problem. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=265.88s)]
*  The problem is Harvard has never played that game. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=267.4s)]
*  As I just said, they routinely disinvite speakers who are deemed transphobic, speakers who are [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=269.2s)]
*  deemed controversial. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=273.52s)]
*  Yet the only acceptance seems to be with Jewish students. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=275.52s)]
*  And my, I wouldn't say offense, my problem with that staff member was not that he challenged [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=278.03999999999996s)]
*  me to debate him as to whether Jews were behind 9-11. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=283.28s)]
*  My problem is he filmed a video taunting me with a machete saying he's coming after for [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=286.24s)]
*  more than blood. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=291.15999999999997s)]
*  I mean, that's a threat. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=292.15999999999997s)]
*  We have to file a police report. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=293.15999999999997s)]
*  So, I agree with that. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=294.15999999999997s)]
*  Wait, did he send that video only to you? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=295.15999999999997s)]
*  He emailed the video only to you of him holding up a knife? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=297.76s)]
*  No. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=301.56s)]
*  So, he had emailed me earlier asking me to debate him in a secluded underpass. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=302.6s)]
*  I don't respond. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=307.04s)]
*  And then he had posted a video later that night with a machete. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=308.04s)]
*  And then about a month later, he tags me on Twitter saying that, yes, he's coming for [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=311.64s)]
*  more than blood and he has a posse, something to that effect. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=315.76s)]
*  Oh, and he's going to bury me in the ground. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=318.2s)]
*  So, you know, that's not appropriate behavior of any staff member. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=320.0s)]
*  But again, I agree with you when it comes to speech. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=323.64s)]
*  I do think speech should be protected, but that's really not what our lawsuit is about. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=326.64s)]
*  Hey, look, we weren't able to access our library because it was surrounded by masked [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=331.12s)]
*  protesters. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=336.0s)]
*  We weren't able to access certain areas in campus because during the encampment, there [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=337.0s)]
*  was a sign that said, make sure to talk to us before you're allowed in. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=340.88s)]
*  You know, these students have no control over whether students can go or not. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=344.4s)]
*  Yet they were able to do that for three weeks. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=348.64s)]
*  So, I think you and I can probably agree that has nothing to do with speech. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=350.52s)]
*  That has to do with the actions and the behavior of students that Harvard allowed to materialize [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=353.71999999999997s)]
*  for weeks on end. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=358.84s)]
*  So, you're saying we're all sorry. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=359.84s)]
*  Good. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=362.28s)]
*  I didn't mean to interrupt. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=363.28s)]
*  I thought you were done. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=364.28s)]
*  So the bottom line, the bottom line is I think each other when it comes to speech. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=365.28s)]
*  However, most of our lawsuit, it's not about speech. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=368.67999999999995s)]
*  It's about a double standard. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=371.28s)]
*  It's about the violation of policies that Harvard refused to discipline students on. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=372.52s)]
*  And in fact, the House Committee on Education in the workforce just detailed yesterday how [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=376.08s)]
*  Harvard did not discipline any of the students who violated Harvard policy. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=379.71999999999997s)]
*  But that's entirely separate from free speech, which again, we would agree should be protected. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=383.79999999999995s)]
*  So when you turned over that email to law enforcement authorities, did they take any [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=387.8s)]
*  action? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=392.76s)]
*  Did they arrest that staff member? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=393.76s)]
*  Did they conclude that he had violated the criminal law? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=394.76s)]
*  Sure. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=397.24s)]
*  So the police told me to file a restraining order, which I did not do simply because I [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=398.24s)]
*  didn't want to drown myself down in the technical bureaucratic details. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=403.36s)]
*  I had better things to do. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=409.8s)]
*  However, it was very clear that he violated Harvard's internal policies as it pertains [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=411.16s)]
*  to bullying, intimidation, and harassment. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=415.6s)]
*  So every time I emailed or called Harvard University about this particular individual, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=417.36s)]
*  they never once responded. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=421.24s)]
*  I mean, that's pretty odd. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=422.24s)]
*  So you had mentioned the group fire.org, of which I'm actually a big fan. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=424.12s)]
*  And at the same time, you were essentially saying there's a double standard because when [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=428.04s)]
*  it comes to free speech, Harvard will basically prohibit anybody from coming to campus that [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=430.76s)]
*  offends any minority group except for Jews. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=437.6s)]
*  Now one of the things that fire has been very vocal on since October 7 is denouncing all [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=441.0s)]
*  kinds of political figures, governors, academic administrators for their, for example, decrees, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=446.0s)]
*  shutting down pro-Palestinian groups, Students for Justice in Palestine, banning particularly [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=454.32s)]
*  incendiary pro-Palestinian speakers. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=458.71999999999997s)]
*  That seems to me to kind of cut against your argument that the only types of students who [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=463.47999999999996s)]
*  are ever subjected to these double standards are Jewish students because in those cases, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=468.44s)]
*  banning those groups are about protecting Jewish students from hearing opinions that [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=472.52s)]
*  they dislike. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=476.47999999999996s)]
*  Is that something that you're comfortable with that you've objected to? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=477.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=480.96s)]
*  So I can talk about Harvard specifically. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=481.96s)]
*  Harvard after about a year or so, they banned the Palestine Solidarity Committee temporarily. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=485.35999999999996s)]
*  They reinstated them about a month ago. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=489.64s)]
*  The reason they banned them had nothing to do with the speakers they were inviting. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=491.35999999999996s)]
*  In fact, today at Harvard University, there was an event on a convicted Palestinian terrorist [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=494.4s)]
*  who killed a 25 year old Jewish person. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=499.15999999999997s)]
*  And the Center for Middle Eastern Studies is having that event as we speak. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=501.8s)]
*  Or actually, I think they just had an hour ago. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=504.35999999999996s)]
*  The reason the Harvard Palestine Solidarity Committee was temporarily banned, and again, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=506.64s)]
*  they were reinstated, is because they kept violating the time, place and manner restrictions. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=510.64s)]
*  So you can protest. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=514.56s)]
*  You can and not only can, but you shouldn't do that. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=515.56s)]
*  I 100 percent, let's make no distinction about this, I 100 percent, people who disagree with [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=517.72s)]
*  me, who people who have controversial opinions, they should be able to protest. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=522.6s)]
*  However, you can't interrupt the classroom. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=526.64s)]
*  And that's what the Harvard Palestine Solidarity Committee was doing. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=528.84s)]
*  You can protest, but you can't block the entrance to the library, which is what the [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=531.56s)]
*  Harvard Palestine Solidarity Committee was doing. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=535.24s)]
*  So every university has their own internal policies on what's considered appropriate [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=537.12s)]
*  and inappropriate protesting. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=540.76s)]
*  And the Harvard Palestine Solidarity Committee, in addition with other groups like Harvard [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=542.1999999999999s)]
*  out of Occupied Palestine, Harvard Jews for Palestine, the list goes on. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=546.12s)]
*  They just kept violating time, place and manner restrictions. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=549.16s)]
*  And the best example, of course, is the encampment. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=551.52s)]
*  So you can protest. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=553.3199999999999s)]
*  But what you can't do, and this is what happened to me, is you can't follow people [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=554.8s)]
*  on their way to class. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=558.48s)]
*  You can't record them with their phones. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=559.72s)]
*  And I have former classmates, former friends who would don these bright yellow safety [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=561.5600000000001s)]
*  vests, and they would quite literally follow me to class and I would ask them what they [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=565.6800000000001s)]
*  were doing and they wouldn't respond to me. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=569.52s)]
*  And this happened for three weeks on end. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=570.84s)]
*  So the reason they were temporarily banned was not to do with free speech. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=572.6800000000001s)]
*  It had to do with their inappropriate behavior and the violation of internal policies. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=577.28s)]
*  But absolutely, you have a right to to be anti-Semitic. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=581.04s)]
*  You have a right to chant controversial slogans. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=584.24s)]
*  Like that to Israel, like that to Israel or globalize the Intifada? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=587.24s)]
*  Are those all permissible free speech expressions in your view? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=590.92s)]
*  So when it comes to the public square, I think, yes, the problem is Harvard has internal [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=595.96s)]
*  policies and they've routinely criticized speech in the past. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=600.36s)]
*  So Harvard is the one that needs to make this distinction. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=603.12s)]
*  Harvard needs to be the one to say either all speech is prohibited or all speech is [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=605.4s)]
*  permitted. What they can't do is say there is controversial speech that we're going to [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=609.52s)]
*  protect. But if it's controversial speak that targets Jewish students, yeah, that's fine. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=613.28s)]
*  It's the double standard. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=617.12s)]
*  Glenn, that's what I get. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=618.24s)]
*  That's on that question, the double standard. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=619.4000000000001s)]
*  Your lawsuit doesn't just talk about Harvard. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=621.96s)]
*  It talks about Ivy League schools in general. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=624.6s)]
*  I've heard you in interviews and speeches talking about American academia, American [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=626.6s)]
*  academic institutions in general. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=629.9200000000001s)]
*  So you're right. The student for the students for justice in Palestine were temporarily [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=631.88s)]
*  banned or suspended by Harvard. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=638.08s)]
*  But a lot of other schools around the country since October 7th, they were just shut [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=639.64s)]
*  down. Ron DeSantis, for example, ordered every student for justice in Palestine group [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=642.96s)]
*  shut down and banned from every campus that something fire objected to. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=647.76s)]
*  Columbia actually did the same. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=651.6800000000001s)]
*  So in terms of the double standards, while there's all these bannings and suspensions of [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=653.6s)]
*  pro-Palestinian groups, are you aware of any pro-Israel group that has been suspended or [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=657.24s)]
*  disciplined or punished in any way on American campuses since October 7th? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=661.44s)]
*  Sure. I mean, I'll answer the question with a question. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=666.24s)]
*  Are you aware of any pro-Israel group that has called for the ethnic genocide of Muslims [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=668.0400000000001s)]
*  that have blocked the entrances of libraries, that have protested inside of classrooms, that [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=671.52s)]
*  have disrupted classrooms, that have targeted the Muslim Student Association with swastikas? [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=675.52s)]
*  The answer is no, of course not. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=680.1999999999999s)]
*  So in terms of the specifics, again, I'd rather focus on Harvard. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=681.48s)]
*  But Ron DeSantis, for example, when he shut down students for justice in Palestine, he was [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=684.84s)]
*  citing a lawsuit that ENJAC, the National Jewish Advocate Center, I think that's the [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=689.04s)]
*  acronym that they filed against students for justice in Palestine and a litany of other [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=692.76s)]
*  groups because they receive a lot of their funding from this dark outside money, including [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=696.4s)]
*  Qatar. And in the case of Code Pink, they actually get a lot of their money from the Chinese [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=700.76s)]
*  Communist Party. So I think that's what he was citing. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=703.84s)]
*  In terms of Colombia, I think it's pretty obvious why Colombia shut down their students for [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=706.04s)]
*  justice in Palestine. And that's because a significant amount of their members took part in [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=709.92s)]
*  the occupation of Hamilton Hall. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=713.64s)]
*  They took a maintenance worker hostage. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=714.96s)]
*  They vandalized private property and they refused to leave. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=716.64s)]
*  So, again, I'm all for using free speech and exercising your First Amendment rights, but [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=718.96s)]
*  not when it comes to vandalizing property, not when it comes to threatening or harming [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=723.64s)]
*  other students physically. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=727.8s)]
*  And I'll just close by saying this. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=728.84s)]
*  I'm I'm in Pittsburgh today. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=730.36s)]
*  I met with students at the University of Pittsburgh as I was talking to the students. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=731.9200000000001s)]
*  There was a university wide alert saying that there was a physical assault against a [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=735.96s)]
*  Jewish student last night where anti-Semitic threats were being yelled at as well. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=740.36s)]
*  This is the third physical assault against a Jewish student at the University of [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=744.6800000000001s)]
*  Pittsburgh this month alone. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=748.9200000000001s)]
*  I mean, whether this was an African-American student, a Jewish student, LGBTQ plus student, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=750.6s)]
*  these threats can never be tolerated on our college campuses. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=755.6s)]
*  But I guess just in terms of the argument that you just made about why pro-Palestinian [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=758.6400000000001s)]
*  groups are banned, you were essentially saying, well, pro-Palestinian groups are banned all [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=764.84s)]
*  over the country because they were actually violating the rules, whereas pro-Israel groups [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=767.6s)]
*  were never suspended because they didn't violate the rules. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=772.08s)]
*  That sounds to me like a defense that you're making that college campuses and college [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=775.0400000000001s)]
*  administrators are actually applying the laws equally by banning pro-Palestinian groups [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=779.84s)]
*  when they violate the law and treating pro-Israel groups exactly the same way. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=785.72s)]
*  So it seems like it's I guess what I'm saying is it's very hard to understand how you can [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=789.36s)]
*  claim that only Jews are not given these protections. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=793.8000000000001s)]
*  Only Jews are treated in these derogatory ways. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=797.64s)]
*  When if you look at the last year by your own argument, you're basically saying, yeah, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=799.88s)]
*  there were tons of Palestinian groups that were banned, but they deserved it and no pro-Israel [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=803.44s)]
*  groups are banned because they didn't. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=807.48s)]
*  I mean, isn't that exactly what you would want, assuming all those facts that you asserted [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=808.72s)]
*  are true? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=812.0400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, well, no, I think you're lumping two things together. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=813.48s)]
*  One is I'm talking about the double standard at Harvard University. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=815.8s)]
*  And then broadly speaking, I would agree. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=818.64s)]
*  The University of Miami, the University of Florida, they've never had a double standard. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=820.28s)]
*  I very much encourage the American people to look at those universities because they [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=823.52s)]
*  really are about the free exchange of ideas and they're not really into the political [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=827.04s)]
*  indoctrination. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=830.24s)]
*  No, but I'm saying at Harvard, I'm saying at Harvard, comparing the treatment of the [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=831.12s)]
*  pro-Palestinian group that was temporarily suspended to the pro-Israel groups that never [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=834.1999999999999s)]
*  were, it sounds to me like you're arguing that the laws, those rules were applied justly. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=837.64s)]
*  They were applied justly to the pro-Palestinian group and to the pro-Israel group. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=842.9200000000001s)]
*  No, no, not not not at all. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=847.52s)]
*  I mean, I encourage all your viewers to to read our lawsuit in full. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=849.32s)]
*  Yes, it is true. I give Harvard credit for temporarily suspending the group. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=852.88s)]
*  But then again, they unsuspended them and they just had an unsanctioned protest literally [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=856.6s)]
*  yesterday where they again surrounded the entrance to the library. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=860.8000000000001s)]
*  However, if you want to talk about a double standard, forget about the Mohammed el [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=863.84s)]
*  Khurr when they invited that controversial speaker, which is the example I gave earlier. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=867.4s)]
*  We could talk about the encampments. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=870.52s)]
*  You had hundreds of students and professors who set up illegal encampments on [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=871.76s)]
*  Harvard property. They violated all time, place and manner restrictions in clear [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=876.76s)]
*  violation of Harvard policy. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=880.16s)]
*  And only 13 students were suspended. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=882.04s)]
*  And as of a month ago, 13 of the 13 had their suspensions revoked. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=884.24s)]
*  Not only that, in exchange in exchange for the encampment leaders leaving, the [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=887.52s)]
*  president of the university, Alan Garber, told them you will be able to meet with the [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=892.72s)]
*  Harvard Management Corporation, which oversees Harvard's 50 billion dollar [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=896.96s)]
*  endowment to talk about divestment from Israel. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=900.5600000000001s)]
*  You will be able to meet with Harvard senior faculty members to talk about the [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=902.72s)]
*  establishment of a Palestinian study center. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=906.08s)]
*  Well, I've been asking for a meeting with Alan Garber and senior administrators for [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=908.08s)]
*  months, and they never once responded to any of my emails. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=912.0s)]
*  So how come if you violate the law, if you follow Jews on their way to class, if you [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=914.24s)]
*  set up encampments throughout the campus, you'll have your voices heard. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=917.76s)]
*  But if you play by the rules, you won't have your voices heard. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=921.08s)]
*  So that's just one example, I would say, of a pretty obvious double standard. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=923.48s)]
*  But as I said, I'm happy to give you more examples. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=926.28s)]
*  How is your voice suppressed or silenced or fellow pro-Israel groups? [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=927.48s)]
*  How are your voices suppressed? [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=931.3199999999999s)]
*  It sounds like, I mean, from what I see, you're all over the media. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=932.48s)]
*  You've had a ton of platforms to be heard, both at Harvard and more broadly in the [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=934.72s)]
*  U.S. media. How has your voice or the voice of pro-Israel advocates been silenced or [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=939.9599999999999s)]
*  censored? Well, to be clear, in this 15 minute interview, I never used the word [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=944.1999999999999s)]
*  suppressed or silenced. I don't think I am being suppressed or silenced by the [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=948.8399999999999s)]
*  national media, evident by the fact that I'm on the national media. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=952.0799999999999s)]
*  I'm talking about a double standard. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=954.4s)]
*  I never said we're being suppressed. I never said we're being silenced. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=955.84s)]
*  I said we are treated categorically different. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=958.64s)]
*  And again, you don't have to take my word for it. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=960.76s)]
*  We have the president of Harvard University say under oath on live TV in front of [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=962.52s)]
*  Congress that you could call for the genocide of Jewish people, depending on the [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=966.36s)]
*  right context, when we know that that would never be tolerated if it was a [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=969.2s)]
*  different minority group. And the best case of that is just last year, there was a [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=972.44s)]
*  homophobic incident and the university immediately that day. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=975.96s)]
*  I don't remember if they expelled, but they certainly suspended the student and [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=979.4s)]
*  then released a university wide email when what's it called? [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=982.16s)]
*  When George Floyd was killed, the university released a statement almost immediately [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=985.52s)]
*  saying that as an institution, they would rid themselves of white supremacy and [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=990.64s)]
*  racism, which I think is a good thing to say. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=994.04s)]
*  The problem was after October 7th, they didn't really say much. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=995.76s)]
*  It took them four days and they couldn't really condemn the 34 student groups who [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=998.7199999999999s)]
*  blamed the Israeli regime for all the ongoing violence in the Middle East. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1003.64s)]
*  After Russia invaded Ukraine, Harvard immediately fought, flied the Ukrainian [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1007.04s)]
*  flag after October 7th. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1010.96s)]
*  When we asked, can you fly the Israeli flag? [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1012.64s)]
*  They said no. So that's a double standard. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1014.52s)]
*  But again, I never used the words suppressed or silence. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1016.6s)]
*  I'm very privileged and fortunate that I have a voice with the national media. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1019.2s)]
*  Speaking of the encampments that you mentioned a couple of times now, one of the [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1023.5600000000001s)]
*  things you said in your RNC speech was, quote, I am her. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1026.96s)]
*  I am I was harassed merely for being a Jew. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1030.52s)]
*  Were these encampments closed to all Jewish students or were there Jewish [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1034.28s)]
*  students participating in those encampments and even helping to organize them and [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1038.2s)]
*  and participating in their duration? [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1042.6000000000001s)]
*  Sure. So I think you and I would probably agree that an African-American saying that [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1046.32s)]
*  the Confederacy wasn't racist is probably wrong. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1050.64s)]
*  So to a Jewish student participating in the encampments, yeah, they can do it, but [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1053.24s)]
*  that doesn't make it any less anti-Semitic. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1056.6000000000001s)]
*  So it is true that there were many Jews who participated in the encampments in the [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1058.64s)]
*  same way that there are some African-Americans who believe in the Confederacy in the [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1062.3600000000001s)]
*  same way that in throughout Jewish history, there is what's called the air of [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1065.48s)]
*  Rav, which is literally translated as the mixed multitude. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1068.72s)]
*  We have a history of Jews within the Jewish community who have not, I would say, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1071.44s)]
*  endorse Jewish values. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1077.0s)]
*  You know, the best example I would probably give was in Nazi Germany when you have the [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1078.24s)]
*  National Association of German Jewry, which was the Jewish division of the Nazi party. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1081.52s)]
*  So I get the question you're trying to arrive at, which is, look, the encampments can't [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1085.48s)]
*  be anti-Semitic if you have Jews doing it. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1088.52s)]
*  But at the end of the day, when you're calling for the violent destruction of the [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1090.32s)]
*  Jewish state, that is anti-Semitic. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1092.88s)]
*  And when I talk about being harassed, yes, I did not initiate any type of conversation [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1094.64s)]
*  with the encampment protesters. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1101.0400000000002s)]
*  I did not try to initiate, God forbid, any type of violence. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1102.16s)]
*  I was simply walking through it. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1105.16s)]
*  And I encourage all of your listeners go on my Twitter. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1106.5600000000002s)]
*  You can see the videos for yourselves every single time I walk through the encampment, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1108.6000000000001s)]
*  which is on my way to class, which on the way to prayers every single time, there would [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1112.88s)]
*  be at least three or four safety marshals, these students who would don these bright [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1116.92s)]
*  yellow vests and they would just follow me and they would record me with their phones. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1121.12s)]
*  And in some cases, the National Lawyers Guild on the last week of the encampments would [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1124.7199999999998s)]
*  come and they would write down what I was doing on their notepads. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1127.9599999999998s)]
*  I mean, that's inexcusable and that's unacceptable. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1130.84s)]
*  And even though you and I, Glenn, probably disagree on a lot of politics, we can both [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1133.0s)]
*  agree that no student should be targeted simply for going to class. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1136.4799999999998s)]
*  I guess what I'm trying to get at is that there have been a lot of attempts to suggest [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1139.1999999999998s)]
*  that these encampments are hostile toward Jewish students, that they impede the flow [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1143.36s)]
*  of people simply because they're Jews. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1148.28s)]
*  As you put it, I was harassed merely for being a Jew. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1150.1999999999998s)]
*  But isn't the real distinction at these encampments not who's Jewish and who's not? [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1153.08s)]
*  I mean, the Columbia one was often held up as the most anti-Semitic one and they were [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1157.52s)]
*  actually having Jewish ceremonies and Shabbat dinners within the encampment. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1160.9599999999998s)]
*  It seemed to me like the difference. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1167.56s)]
*  And I've interviewed a lot of Harvard students and Columbia students and others [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1169.2399999999998s)]
*  participating in these groups, many of whom were Jewish. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1171.8s)]
*  The distinction was not who's a Jew and who isn't a Jew. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1174.36s)]
*  The distinction was who supports the Israeli bombing of Gaza and who doesn't. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1176.44s)]
*  Sure. So again, I think I answered that pretty well in the last answer, which is, yes, [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1182.2s)]
*  there is a tokenization, of course. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1186.68s)]
*  I remember back when I was burning voting for people like Jamal Bowman and AOC, they [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1188.0800000000002s)]
*  would say tokenization is racism and the tokenization of Jewish people. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1192.1200000000001s)]
*  It's nothing new. As I said, there was a Jewish division of the Nazi Party. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1195.72s)]
*  Some of the most vehemently anti-Semitic communists under the Soviet Union were Jews. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1199.52s)]
*  So, yes, it's an unfortunate part of our history, but I was not going around Harvard [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1204.2399999999998s)]
*  University saying, let's kill Gazan civilians. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1209.1999999999998s)]
*  I was going around Harvard University, going to class, and I was followed as a result. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1211.2399999999998s)]
*  But you have spoken out in favor of the Israeli war in Gaza, right? [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1214.8799999999999s)]
*  That is a position that you had publicly expressed, that you publicly expressed before [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1218.0s)]
*  that you support what Israel is doing in Gaza against Hamas. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1221.36s)]
*  So before I answer that question, I guess I'll answer it with a question, which is, [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1225.84s)]
*  even if I did say that, are you saying it's acceptable to be followed for once political? [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1229.0s)]
*  I'm saying that it would be inaccurate to say that the distinction that the encampment [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1232.52s)]
*  was drawing or that the protesters were drawing is simply harassing people who are merely [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1236.12s)]
*  Jews, given that there are many Jews who are inside those encampments, not a few token [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1240.6s)]
*  ones, but actually a large number of young American Jews are very opposed to what the [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1245.28s)]
*  Israelis are doing in Gaza and elsewhere. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1249.52s)]
*  So the distinction that I'm seeing both in the reporting I've done, the interviews I've [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1251.44s)]
*  done, and even based on what you're describing, is not between preventing people from [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1255.52s)]
*  entering the encampment based on who is a Jew or who isn't, meaning keep all Jews out, [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1259.88s)]
*  which would be anti-Semitic. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1263.7600000000002s)]
*  The distinction is this is an encampment that is protesting the Israeli war in Gaza. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1264.8000000000002s)]
*  If you agree with us, we want you to be part of our protest. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1269.0s)]
*  And if you don't, whether you're a Jew or a Christian or even an angelical or an atheist [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1271.48s)]
*  and you support the Israeli bombing of Gaza, that's where the opposition lies. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1275.3600000000001s)]
*  So, I mean, I understand what you're insinuating. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1279.96s)]
*  You're trying to say, well, I was being followed for my political ideologies, which, again, [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1282.48s)]
*  isn't that much better. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1286.0s)]
*  That's still against Harvard policy and still something that you should condemn regardless. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1287.12s)]
*  But again, I'm not in support of Israel indiscriminately bombing Gaza and children. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1290.72s)]
*  Yeah, I'm in support of Israel defending themselves after October 7th. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1294.9199999999998s)]
*  But the reason I was targeted and again, it wasn't just me, it was dozens of Harvard [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1297.4399999999998s)]
*  Jewish students and dozens of Harvard Jewish faculty. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1300.8s)]
*  I'm not the only plaintiff in the lawsuit. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1303.36s)]
*  There are five others. And again, your listeners should certainly read our lawsuit. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1304.72s)]
*  They were being targeted because they were visibly Jewish. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1308.32s)]
*  I mean, there's no other way around it. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1310.36s)]
*  OK, let me ask you about your experience specifically. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1312.52s)]
*  Can I make one last point? [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1315.4399999999998s)]
*  Of course, absolutely. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1316.6399999999999s)]
*  Can I make one last point? [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1317.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1317.9599999999998s)]
*  There are plenty of there are plenty of Harvard students who who are been a lot more vocal [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1318.56s)]
*  about their support of Israel's campaign in Gaza, and they were not followed and they [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1322.7199999999998s)]
*  were not Jewish. So I digress. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1326.9199999999998s)]
*  But anyways, the [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1328.4399999999998s)]
*  before I was a journalist, I was a lawyer, I guess a little bit ashamed to admit it. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1331.12s)]
*  I like to forget about it, but I'm bringing it up here because it's relevant. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1335.12s)]
*  You're a recovering lawyer. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1337.6s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. A recovering lawyer. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1338.3999999999999s)]
*  I did read your lawsuit in depth in preparation for talking to you. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1339.8799999999999s)]
*  And in general, one of the things that happens when you bring a lawsuit, a civil lawsuit [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1343.76s)]
*  of the kind that you brought against Harvard on behalf of an individual, is that you have [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1349.24s)]
*  to say exactly not just what the defendants did wrong or illegally, but what the damages [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1353.68s)]
*  were to the plaintiff who's seeking money damages as you are. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1359.04s)]
*  You're seeking compensatory and punitive damages as part of this lawsuit. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1362.0s)]
*  So I just I heard what you said about being harassed and those things. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1365.44s)]
*  But I just want to make sure we're being very specific and very concrete and very clear [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1369.68s)]
*  were there any times when you were actually physically assaulted or physically injured [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1373.28s)]
*  by pro-Palestinian protesters on Harvard's campus? [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1378.72s)]
*  So again, I understand what you're insinuating. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1382.96s)]
*  No, I'm just I'm honestly not insinuating anything. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1385.2s)]
*  I'm really just trying to ask. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1387.44s)]
*  I'm trying to just get a sense. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1388.64s)]
*  I understand you've talked about things that you did that were done that you thought were [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1389.8400000000001s)]
*  wrong following you around, you know, taping you all of that. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1395.1200000000001s)]
*  But I'm just trying to get an understanding of what actually happened to you. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1398.56s)]
*  And so my question is not really insinuating anything. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1401.36s)]
*  It's really just asking, were you physically assaulted or physically injured in any way [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1403.44s)]
*  by pro-Palestinian students at any point during these protests? [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1407.28s)]
*  There were physical assaults against Jewish students at Harvard University. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1411.76s)]
*  I encourage your listeners to read the lawsuit. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1414.6399999999999s)]
*  Me personally, no. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1417.04s)]
*  Instead, I had private armed security outside my house for a week. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1418.16s)]
*  After a Harvard staff member taunted me with a machete, I've received countless death threats, [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1421.04s)]
*  both online and mail to me. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1425.36s)]
*  So, yeah, there were definitely instances where a me being a Jewish student and really any [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1427.92s)]
*  student were experiencing things that should never really be experienced as a result of being a [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1432.24s)]
*  student at a university and having certain religious ideologies. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1436.16s)]
*  And by the way, as I mentioned earlier, while it is true that I personally was not physically [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1440.0s)]
*  assaulted, thank God. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1444.0s)]
*  And unfortunately, that is not the case of Harvard University. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1445.1200000000001s)]
*  That's also not the case of the many, many experiences of Jewish students across the [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1447.44s)]
*  country. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1450.96s)]
*  Just as I said, just today, there was a physical assault at University of Pittsburgh. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1451.52s)]
*  There were three physical assaults at the University of Michigan in the last couple [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1454.8s)]
*  of weeks. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1457.84s)]
*  So unfortunately, this is happening a lot more often than is being reported. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1458.08s)]
*  Well, I just want to point you to a couple of studies that were done exactly on this [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1460.96s)]
*  question, pretty recent ones. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1466.48s)]
*  One was a study from the armed conflict location and event data from May of 2024. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1467.9199999999998s)]
*  And the title was demonstrations related to the Israel-Palestine conflict in the United States. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1474.56s)]
*  And it said, quote, while some notable violent clashes have recently taken place, such as on [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1478.6399999999999s)]
*  the UCLA campus, where pro-Israel supporters actually initiated that violence, that was the [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1482.96s)]
*  one example they had, the overwhelming majority of student protests since October 7th, in fact, [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1489.3600000000001s)]
*  99%, have remained peaceful. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1494.0s)]
*  And then the Harvard Kennedy School issued a report as well entitled Crowd Counting Consortium, [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1496.8s)]
*  An Empirical Overview of Recent Pro-Palestine Protests at US Schools. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1502.96s)]
*  It said, only a few dozen of these thousands of protest days have seen even property damage [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1506.96s)]
*  or injuries to police or counter protesters. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1512.32s)]
*  Despite that fact, many public figures continue to describe the protest as violent, and police [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1514.56s)]
*  have arrested more than 3,600 protesters. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1519.52s)]
*  Our data also shows that protest participants have been injured by police or counter protesters [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1522.8s)]
*  sometimes severely, about as often as protesters have caused property damage, much of which has [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1527.36s)]
*  been limited to graffiti. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1532.24s)]
*  So it's analyzing essentially every campus protest in the name of the pro-Palestinian cause or the [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1533.2s)]
*  anti-war cause that has taken place since October 7th, and it's essentially saying there are very, [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1539.28s)]
*  very few instances of physical confrontation or violence that has taken place, and the one that [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1544.16s)]
*  was really entailing that was the one at UCLA, which pro-Israel activists from off-campus came [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1549.04s)]
*  and initiated. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1555.76s)]
*  Do you have data that contradicts this, or are you just talking anecdotally about things [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1556.96s)]
*  you've been hearing? [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1560.8799999999999s)]
*  Well, again, I think it's a pretty loaded question. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1561.6s)]
*  First of all, with UCLA in particular, that was in response to a Jewish student who was assaulted [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1565.9199999999998s)]
*  the week before. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1571.04s)]
*  But yes, if you want to talk about statistics, absolutely. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1572.0s)]
*  The National Jewish Advocacy Center showed that physical assaults on Jewish people were up 45%, [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1574.24s)]
*  vandalizing incidents were up 65%, harassment was up 164%. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1581.52s)]
*  If you look at the overwhelming majority of religiously-based hate crimes, the overwhelming [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1586.3999999999999s)]
*  majority are Jewish people. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1590.8s)]
*  If you want to look at Columbia University, where maintenance workers were taken hostage, if you [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1592.24s)]
*  want to look at Harvard University, where there was a physical assault at Harvard Business School, [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1595.2s)]
*  if you want to look at the University of Michigan, where two Jewish students were attacked with a [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1598.64s)]
*  glass bottle. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1603.28s)]
*  So I would have loved to have read this report earlier, which is why I asked her staff if there [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1604.24s)]
*  was anything they needed me to know beforehand. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1608.48s)]
*  But even if we were to take what that report is, and I haven't heard of that organization before, [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1610.72s)]
*  even if we were to take what they were saying at face value, it does not in any way take away from [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1614.8s)]
*  the actual lived experiences of Jewish students who've been physically attacked and physically [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1619.28s)]
*  assaulted on their campuses. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1623.2s)]
*  So I'm happy, if you want to send that over, I'm happy to read that study in more depth. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1624.56s)]
*  But again, I can point to the FBI statistics that have shown that rates of anti-Semitism, and we're [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1627.6799999999998s)]
*  not talking about anything verbal or hate speech, we're talking about physical assaults, they have [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1631.76s)]
*  skyrocketed since the October 7 attacks here in the United States. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1636.1599999999999s)]
*  Just to be clear, there were two studies, one of which came from the Harvard Kennedy School, the other [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1639.36s)]
*  which was very widely publicized in almost every major media. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1642.56s)]
*  So let me just add to that real quick. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1645.04s)]
*  Can I add to that real quick? [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1648.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1649.12s)]
*  I would just add that the Harvard Kennedy School employs someone by the name of Marshall Gans. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1649.36s)]
*  Marshall Gans was found to have discriminated against Jewish students, not just through Harvard [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1653.84s)]
*  Kennedy's own internal investigation, but also by the Brandeis Center he's still employed. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1657.6s)]
*  So I wouldn't exactly take Harvard Kennedy School at their word. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1661.04s)]
*  So you feel the data might have been fabricated or just invented? [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1663.36s)]
*  Well, again, that's why I asked your staff if they could send me anything. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1666.56s)]
*  So if you were going to pull things out, I'd be able to read it before, but I would say again, [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1669.84s)]
*  just talk to Jewish students. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1673.28s)]
*  Talk to my friend Hannah from UC Berkeley who had a rock thrown through her dorm window with a note [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1674.72s)]
*  saying, F Jews. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1678.24s)]
*  Talk to my friend Eden at Columbia who was stalked to her dorm room one night because she was wearing [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1679.1999999999998s)]
*  a star date. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1682.96s)]
*  Talk to Eli Tzivis who he went a little viral at UCLA. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1683.68s)]
*  He was prevented from going to class because there were people who were preventing him from [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1687.04s)]
*  the camp. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1690.8s)]
*  You talk to Talia, I shouldn't say her last name. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1691.28s)]
*  You should talk to Talia at MIT who had also a physical incident. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1692.96s)]
*  So I would encourage you to amplify the voices of Jewish students who've been saying for months [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1697.04s)]
*  now that they are under physical assault. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1700.88s)]
*  And again, we are total in agreement here, Glenn, that peaceful protest is great. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1702.56s)]
*  And it's great to hear that so many of these protests were in fact peaceful. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1707.28s)]
*  But I would be very skeptical of the data that would show 99% were peaceful. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1710.56s)]
*  I mean, just last night in New York City, which is where I live, the NYPD had to arrest [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1714.3999999999999s)]
*  dozens of people after they were smashing glass windows, after they were vandalizing. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1718.48s)]
*  Even when Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu was speaking, they were burning American flags. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1722.48s)]
*  They were desecrating World War II monuments. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1725.6s)]
*  So I'd be pretty skeptical on any study that would suggest that 99% of all these protests [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1727.28s)]
*  were peaceful. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1731.52s)]
*  Yeah, no, to be clear, I don't think that like burning flags or even vandalizing a building is [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1732.08s)]
*  typically regarded as violence. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1736.24s)]
*  Violence is the physical injuring of other human beings. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1737.76s)]
*  I think that's what the study was trying to take a look at. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1740.8s)]
*  Let me just ask the next question, and then you can respond however you want, including [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1748.8s)]
*  by adding on another point. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1752.3200000000002s)]
*  You're citing hate speech reporting, self-reporting by American Jews who are reporting [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1754.3200000000002s)]
*  in larger numbers what they claim to be incidents of anti-Semitism. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1759.2s)]
*  That's the hate speech. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1763.04s)]
*  The hate crimes increase that you're referring to are self-reporting by American Jews. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1765.28s)]
*  In the same time, say during the last two years or three years, those same statistics [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1770.08s)]
*  show a very significant increase in reported anti-black racism, anti-transphobic violence, [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1774.72s)]
*  anti-immigrant violence, anti-Muslim bigotry. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1783.36s)]
*  Do you see essentially all of these groups as suffering similar forms of bigotry, or do you [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1787.5200000000002s)]
*  feel like the group to which you belong has a kind of special or elevated danger that it faces in [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1794.0s)]
*  the United States? [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1800.4s)]
*  Sure. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1802.48s)]
*  Again, I have to reject the premise of the question. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1802.96s)]
*  The Federal Bureau of Investigations, the FBI, is not an organization of Jews self-reporting. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1806.0s)]
*  And the FBI, again, your listeners can all Google this, the FBI released their statistics [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1810.64s)]
*  on hate crimes on September 23rd or September 24th, and it found that Jewish hate crimes [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1815.68s)]
*  increased by 63%. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1821.1200000000001s)]
*  And again, this is not speech. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1822.48s)]
*  This is nothing to do with verbal assaults. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1823.76s)]
*  This has to do with physical attacks. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1825.6000000000001s)]
*  It increased by 63%. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1827.04s)]
*  Even though Jews make up 2% of the U.S. population, the fact that Jews are the overwhelming victims [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1828.72s)]
*  of hate crimes really points to the fact that yes, what is happening to Jewish Americans [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1834.48s)]
*  is quantitatively and qualitatively different than what's happening to other Americans. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1838.96s)]
*  And look, I remember marching with Black Lives Matter. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1842.4s)]
*  I was very proud to do so. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1844.56s)]
*  And I remember when people would tell me, well, it's true, Black Lives Matter, but all [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1845.84s)]
*  lives matter. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1848.8799999999999s)]
*  I would get very upset because, yeah, it's true, all lives matter. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1849.6s)]
*  But right now, the focus is on Black Lives because they're the ones who are experiencing [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1852.32s)]
*  systemic oppression. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1855.9199999999998s)]
*  They're the ones who are telling us that they're not safe. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1856.72s)]
*  And I find it really odd that when it comes to anti-Semitism, a lot of reporters, and I [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1858.8s)]
*  don't want to say sisters yourself because, you know, I have no reason to think you're [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1862.72s)]
*  acting in any way that isn't honest. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1865.6799999999998s)]
*  And, you know, I'm a fan of yours. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1867.52s)]
*  But I would say I do find it a little odd that reporters and certain politicians, they'll [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1869.28s)]
*  try to equate the Jewish experience to all forms of bigotry and hatred. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1873.84s)]
*  The Senate Judiciary Committee finally had a hearing on hate crimes, and it was really [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1877.04s)]
*  meant to be hearing on anti-Semitism. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1881.4399999999998s)]
*  But it turned into this all lives matter spectacle. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1883.12s)]
*  And I think that really points to what we're Jewish Americans are talking about, which [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1885.6s)]
*  is a double standard. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1888.24s)]
*  You know, how come during Black Lives Matter, you didn't have politicians condemning transphobia [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1889.1999999999998s)]
*  and sexism? [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1892.48s)]
*  Because, yeah, those are bad things. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1893.1999999999998s)]
*  But right now, the focus is on Black Lives. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1894.3999999999999s)]
*  Yet when it comes to anti-Semitism, all of a sudden, we all lives matter, the issue. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1895.84s)]
*  So again, this is not due to self-reporting instances of feeling uncomfortable. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1899.04s)]
*  This is the FBI's own data. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1903.1999999999998s)]
*  They found that close to 12,000 religiously motivated hate crimes were committed in the [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1904.56s)]
*  last year alone. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1908.7199999999998s)]
*  Overwhelming were victims. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1909.6799999999998s)]
*  Overwhelming victims were Jewish. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1911.84s)]
*  But what I'm getting at is I feel like, you know, all human beings are tribalistic. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1913.12s)]
*  We evolved that way. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1918.1599999999999s)]
*  We have to be part of a tribe for thousands of years in order to survive. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1919.12s)]
*  We see the world through our own tribalistic lens. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1922.6399999999999s)]
*  We typically see the world through our subjectivity. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1924.9599999999998s)]
*  Do you ever question whether or not the reason you think that at the moment the most [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1928.7199999999998s)]
*  endangered or the most marginalized group or the focus of all the hatred is the particular [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1933.04s)]
*  group with which you identify that maybe the reason for that is because you're looking [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1938.0s)]
*  at things tribalistically? [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1941.92s)]
*  In other words, I identify primarily as a Jew, and I'm here to say that my group, Jewish [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1942.96s)]
*  people, are uniquely or particularly endangered right now in the United States as compared [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1948.24s)]
*  to other minority groups, including Black people and trans people and Muslim people [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1953.68s)]
*  and immigrants. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1958.32s)]
*  Well, again, it's an interesting question, but I would answer it by saying if that's [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1959.4399999999998s)]
*  true that I'm primarily motivated by tribalism, then how come I was protesting with Black [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1963.6s)]
*  Lives Matter? [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1967.28s)]
*  How come I was marching when the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade? [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1968.0s)]
*  I mean, I'm not a woman and I'm not black, but I was particularly concerned about women [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1972.0s)]
*  and African Americans during those two time periods because they were the ones who were [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1975.6s)]
*  overwhelmingly being oppressed and being cut out of a system. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1979.28s)]
*  So too when it comes to antisemitism, I think, yeah, the focus right now is on antisemitism, [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1982.7199999999998s)]
*  is on the Jewish people, not because I'm tribalistic, just because the data doesn't [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1987.2s)]
*  lie, Glenn. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1990.32s)]
*  I mean, look at the FBI statistics. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1991.04s)]
*  Look at the Department of Justice. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1992.8s)]
*  Look at the Department of Education. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1993.92s)]
*  They overwhelmingly corroborate what Jews are saying. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1995.68s)]
*  But what has happened to hate crimes to other groups in the last few years? [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=1997.28s)]
*  What has happened to hate crime, the rate of hate crimes with these other groups? [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2000.64s)]
*  Have they declined? [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2004.56s)]
*  Have they stayed the same? [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2005.8400000000001s)]
*  Have they increased? [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2007.2s)]
*  Do you know? [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2007.92s)]
*  No, correct. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2009.6000000000001s)]
*  Hate crimes overall have gone up, and the overwhelming majority of those hate crime [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2010.72s)]
*  victims are Jewish people. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2014.8s)]
*  We count for roughly two thirds. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2015.9199999999998s)]
*  So while it is true that anti-black racism, while it is true that misogyny, while it is [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2017.52s)]
*  true that transphobia are problems. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2022.72s)]
*  And again, that is why I proudly marched with Black Lives Matter. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2024.24s)]
*  That's why I will continue to stand up for people who are being the victims of oppression. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2026.9599999999998s)]
*  I would simply ask that just like we marched with them and we showed concern, genuine concern [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2030.72s)]
*  for them, that they should show genuine concern for us. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2034.9599999999998s)]
*  And I don't think that's asking too much. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2036.9599999999998s)]
*  I'm not, God forbid, trying to suppress the freedom of other people. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2038.24s)]
*  So I'm simply saying we should protect all Americans. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2041.6799999999998s)]
*  And right now the issue is Jewish Americans. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2043.44s)]
*  And by the way, if it was Muslim Americans who were being disproportionately targeted, [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2046.0800000000002s)]
*  if they were two thirds of all religiously motivated hate crimes, I would stand up with [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2049.28s)]
*  my Muslim brothers and sisters. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2052.8s)]
*  The reality is, while it is true, acts of Islamophobia, acts of transphobia, acts of [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2054.16s)]
*  racism are happening, they are not happening at the same rate as anti-Semitism. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2058.8s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2062.48s)]
*  I just want to understand the claim you're making because I heard you at first to be [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2062.96s)]
*  saying that more than half of all hate crimes are against Jewish people in the United States, [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2067.92s)]
*  even though it's only 2% of the population. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2073.6800000000003s)]
*  And then at the end, you sort of amended that to say the majority of religiously motivated [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2076.2400000000002s)]
*  crimes, which obviously wouldn't count anti-black racism, attacks on immigrants, transphobia. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2081.12s)]
*  You're saying that the majority of hate crimes in the United States, the majority, more than [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2085.6s)]
*  50% are directed at American Jews and black people and LGBTs and Muslims and immigrants [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2090.56s)]
*  and women. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2097.12s)]
*  Gender motivated violence against women constitute a minority, all those together? [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2098.72s)]
*  No, so let me be clear. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2103.7599999999998s)]
*  Thank you for correcting that. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2104.7999999999997s)]
*  68% of all religiously motivated hate crimes, according to the FBI, that were conducted in 2023, [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2106.0s)]
*  the targets were Jewish people. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2112.96s)]
*  In terms of hate crimes, more broadly speaking, we know that Jewish people are disproportionately [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2114.7999999999997s)]
*  targeted for hate crimes. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2118.7999999999997s)]
*  They are disproportionately more affected than other minority groups. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2120.4s)]
*  Again, that does not take away from the real plight that other minority groups experienced, [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2123.36s)]
*  which is why I'm very proud of my activism on behalf of other minority groups. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2127.1200000000003s)]
*  But again, the issue right now, I would argue, because the data supports it, is certainly [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2130.96s)]
*  anti-Semitism. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2135.76s)]
*  Your group, the hostility against your group is the issue right now. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2136.4s)]
*  That's what your argument is? [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2140.56s)]
*  If you can point to transgender individuals who are not being allowed access to their [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2143.6s)]
*  libraries on campus, then I will gladly come back on this program and I will denounce that, [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2149.04s)]
*  and I will stand with my trans allies. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2153.44s)]
*  However, if you look at Harvard University, if you look at Columbia, if you look at UCLA, [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2156.16s)]
*  if you look at University of Michigan, I mean, the list goes on and on. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2160.64s)]
*  We have seen Jewish people who are being denied the ability to learn in the library [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2163.04s)]
*  because it is being surrounded. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2168.0s)]
*  So again, I don't think it's an either or. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2169.6s)]
*  I don't think we can only focus on anti-Semitism and shut out all other hate crimes, but I do [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2171.92s)]
*  think we have to be a little realistic, which is when you look at the statistics, again, [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2176.32s)]
*  this is not a he said, she said. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2180.32s)]
*  This is not a subjective policy or subjective narrative. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2181.6000000000004s)]
*  The statistics bear out that objectively, Jews in the 21st century and explicitly and [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2184.96s)]
*  specifically after October 7th have been the victims of religiously motivated hate crimes. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2190.0800000000004s)]
*  So let's look at Harvard, which you've been encouraging us to do specifically in statistics [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2195.6000000000004s)]
*  as well. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2200.0800000000004s)]
*  And I just want to cite a couple of statistics regarding Harvard. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2200.88s)]
*  Over the last 25 years, Harvard has had a total of five presidents. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2203.76s)]
*  One of them lasted about 11 months, Claudine Gay. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2208.8s)]
*  Of the four other presidents, three of them were Jewish. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2211.76s)]
*  So three of the last five presidents at Harvard, the people who ran the school, the top official, [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2215.92s)]
*  three out of the five of them were Jewish. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2221.92s)]
*  More than 50%, even though, as you point out, Jews are only 2% of the American population. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2223.5200000000004s)]
*  For decades now, Jews have been wildly overrepresented at elite universities like Harvard [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2227.36s)]
*  in terms of their population in the United States. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2234.96s)]
*  And even now, even as it's declined for a variety of reasons, it's still the case that [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2237.1200000000003s)]
*  the percentage of the Harvard student population is 10% or four to five times the percentage of [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2240.5600000000004s)]
*  Jews in terms of the overall population. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2247.6800000000003s)]
*  And by the way, although three out of the five Harvard presidents of the last 25 years were [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2250.0800000000004s)]
*  Jewish, the fourth one, though she wasn't Jewish, she was married to a Jewish Harvard [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2255.92s)]
*  professor who's a renowned historian of medicine, Harvey Rosenberg. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2260.56s)]
*  Is it really possible to depict an institution that continuously empowers at the highest [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2265.04s)]
*  level a massively disproportionate number of Jews to run the institution whose student [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2271.92s)]
*  body is overwhelmingly filled with a lot of Jewish students as compared to their [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2277.04s)]
*  percentage of their population? [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2282.0s)]
*  Is that institution really possibly a bastion of Jew hatred or anti-Semitic? [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2283.28s)]
*  Yeah, I think I get asked this question a lot. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2289.6s)]
*  I think the answer is actually really simple. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2291.2s)]
*  Glenn, you and I would probably agree that there is systemic racism or African Americans [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2292.64s)]
*  are in some level or another being disadvantaged by our political system. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2297.44s)]
*  Yet, would I, God forbid, tell an African American in 2020 or, excuse me, in 2012, [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2300.8s)]
*  what are you talking about? [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2305.52s)]
*  The president of the United States is black. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2306.4s)]
*  The attorney general, Eric Holder, is black. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2307.68s)]
*  No, because while it is true, there are exceptions. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2309.6s)]
*  I'm very proud of the fact that Jewish people disproportionately have excelled in [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2312.0s)]
*  technological advancements, in medical breakthroughs, in academia. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2315.28s)]
*  In media, in business, in Silicon Valley, in politics, in academic institutions like [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2319.52s)]
*  Harvard, pretty much every sector of American life, Jews haven't continued to thrive. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2325.36s)]
*  Even though that's true, what is your conclusion? [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2329.44s)]
*  Yeah, as I was saying, 100 years ago, the population of Jewish students at Harvard [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2333.1200000000003s)]
*  University was 25%. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2337.36s)]
*  Today, it's 4%. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2338.6400000000003s)]
*  It's not because Jews got dumber over time. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2339.52s)]
*  It's because Jews have been cracked down and there's been a systemic campaign to crack [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2341.28s)]
*  down on the amount of Jews at the university. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2345.44s)]
*  Again, the numbers don't lie. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2346.8s)]
*  The statistics don't lie. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2347.76s)]
*  So in the same way that you can't look at disproportionate amounts of Jews being successful [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2348.88s)]
*  because Jews are successful, we invest a lot in our education. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2352.48s)]
*  We invest a lot in our communities. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2356.0800000000004s)]
*  We invest a lot in our values. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2358.1600000000003s)]
*  We're family-oriented. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2360.4s)]
*  And I would encourage any community to take a look at what the Jewish community is doing [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2361.6000000000004s)]
*  and probably reciprocate or replicate what that is all about. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2365.36s)]
*  In fact, that's why you have so many Asian Americans typically who go to Israel. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2369.2s)]
*  When I was studying in Yeshiva at Eshet Torah, we often would have Christian groups from [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2372.24s)]
*  Korea, from Japan, some cases from China, who would come to our Yeshiva and study the [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2376.24s)]
*  Talmud with us because they wanted to understand what is it about Jewish success. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2379.8399999999997s)]
*  So I think two things can be true at the same time. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2383.04s)]
*  I think Jews can be successful because that's the way we're geared because we very much [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2384.7999999999997s)]
*  value education. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2389.04s)]
*  We very much value the family structure. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2390.3999999999996s)]
*  And at the same time, it is so remarkable that we're so successful given the systemic [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2392.3999999999996s)]
*  and pervasive nature of antisemitism, like the fact that our rates of being students [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2397.28s)]
*  at Harvard has plummeted, plummeted at Harvard University and at universities across the [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2401.6800000000003s)]
*  level. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2405.84s)]
*  So I don't think the question is, well, how can there be antisemitism if Jews are so successful? [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2406.0s)]
*  I think we should ask it the opposite way, which is, wow, Jews are so successful even [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2410.0s)]
*  though there's antisemitism. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2413.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I guess I think a lot of people did view the election of Barack Obama as a [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2414.88s)]
*  pretty strong symbol of how much progress America had made based on race. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2418.6400000000003s)]
*  And I think if you were to have a country like the United States where three of the [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2423.04s)]
*  last five American presidents elected by the American people were all black and the fourth [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2426.88s)]
*  one was married to a black person and black people filled the highest ranks of government [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2433.28s)]
*  overwhelmingly disproportionately to their numbers, I think you would start to have an [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2438.48s)]
*  argument that would say it's kind of difficult to continue to maintain that the United States [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2442.32s)]
*  is a systematically racist country in light of those statistics. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2446.56s)]
*  Let me just ask you one question. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2450.48s)]
*  There's been a few times in your answers where you have kind of suggested that, say, [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2452.96s)]
*  Jewish people participating in anti-war protests or encampments against the Israeli war in [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2458.48s)]
*  Gaza are tokens because they're betraying Jewish values. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2463.12s)]
*  Jewish values was a phrase you used in your RNC speech where you said essentially Jewish [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2466.88s)]
*  values are American values, American values are Jewish values. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2471.28s)]
*  After that speech, there were a lot of articles from a lot of Jewish people pretty vehemently [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2474.2400000000002s)]
*  objecting to what they heard you to be saying that you are the spokesperson for what Jewish [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2480.0s)]
*  values are, that you are a spokesperson on behalf of American Jewry. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2485.12s)]
*  There was an article in the Jewish journal Forward that said, I'm a Jew studying at Harvard [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2488.48s)]
*  Divinity School. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2493.84s)]
*  Shabbos Kastenbaum does not speak for me. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2494.64s)]
*  There was an article from a rabbi in the Jewish journal the Forward as well arguing that you [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2497.36s)]
*  distorted quote what you call Jewish values. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2501.2s)]
*  Do you feel like in what you're saying and you told me earlier, go talk to Jews. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2503.68s)]
*  I've had a lot of Jews on my show about this issue. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2507.44s)]
*  On both sides. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2509.92s)]
*  Do you feel like when you're articulating these views you are speaking for the vast vast [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2510.96s)]
*  majority of American Jews that kind of like is a spokesman or do you feel like you're [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2515.52s)]
*  speaking only for yourself? [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2518.32s)]
*  Sure, so let's be clear. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2521.36s)]
*  One of the criticisms I often get is that I'm the self declared spokesman of the Jewish [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2522.2400000000002s)]
*  people. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2525.6800000000003s)]
*  Nothing could be further from the truth. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2525.92s)]
*  I'm actually glad you mentioned that article in Forward because it was written, I won't say [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2527.28s)]
*  his name, but it was written by a former classmate of mine who was literally a student leader at [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2530.2400000000002s)]
*  the encampments who was calling for an intifada. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2534.16s)]
*  So yeah, obviously I don't speak for him. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2536.16s)]
*  I would never want to speak for someone like him. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2537.6800000000003s)]
*  Same thing with that rabbi who you mentioned. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2539.36s)]
*  This is someone who has never met me as someone who made baseless accusations in that article. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2540.96s)]
*  So no, I certainly don't speak for those two individuals and I certainly would not want [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2545.92s)]
*  to speak to those two individuals. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2548.56s)]
*  What I can say again is I'm kind of a numbers guy. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2549.76s)]
*  The data shows that the overwhelming majority of Jewish people consider themselves to be [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2552.08s)]
*  Zionists. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2556.2400000000002s)]
*  And in fact, I'm a religious Jew, which is why I have to hop off soon for the Sabbath. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2556.7200000000003s)]
*  As a religious Jew, I pray three times a day. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2560.8s)]
*  You know the direction I face when I pray three times a day? [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2563.04s)]
*  I face Jerusalem. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2565.2000000000003s)]
*  You know what I have been saying in my prayers every single day since the day I was born? [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2566.24s)]
*  In addition to the fact that for 3000 years, Jews have been saying these things, the return [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2569.8399999999997s)]
*  to Zion, the centrality of the land of Israel to our lives. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2573.8399999999997s)]
*  In fact, we just had the holiday of Tisha B'Av, the ninth of Av, which is the saddest [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2576.9599999999996s)]
*  day of the Jewish year. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2580.56s)]
*  It's a day where we don't wear leather shoes. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2581.3599999999997s)]
*  We don't eat. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2582.72s)]
*  We don't drink. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2583.2s)]
*  We were refrained from marital relations. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2584.0s)]
*  Why? [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2586.08s)]
*  Because on that day, 2500 years ago, our first and second temple was destroyed in Jerusalem. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2586.64s)]
*  In fact, of the 613 commandments, a third of them can no longer be fulfilled because [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2592.08s)]
*  they have to do with Jews living in the land of Israel. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2596.88s)]
*  Not only that, there is a positive command from the Bible itself that you must live in [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2599.52s)]
*  the land of Israel. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2605.28s)]
*  So yeah, it is certainly true that Jews who primarily are not educated, primarily Jews [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2606.24s)]
*  who have not been to Israel, primarily Jews who cannot read the Talmud if you ask them [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2610.08s)]
*  to because they have very little education, it's true. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2613.44s)]
*  They don't subscribe to those values and that's their choice. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2615.36s)]
*  But just like a vegetarian can't say, I'm a vegetarian even though I don't eat, excuse [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2618.16s)]
*  me, I'm a vegetarian even though I eat meat, so too you can't say that I'm Jewish, but [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2622.08s)]
*  we have no connection to the land of Israel. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2626.16s)]
*  We are literally called Jews because we come from Judea, we're the only minority group [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2628.16s)]
*  that are quite literally named after the place we are from. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2631.6s)]
*  So living in Israel is a positive command. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2634.16s)]
*  Jews have been living in the land of Israel uninterrupted for 3000 years. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2636.48s)]
*  So look, I appreciate you having me on. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2639.44s)]
*  I really do. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2641.2s)]
*  And I'm always happy to come back, Len, but I'm not a spokesman for the Jewish community. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2641.68s)]
*  I have never once described myself in such ways. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2646.8s)]
*  And I would also argue that if you look at Jewish history, we have always had detractors. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2649.28s)]
*  We have always had Jews who do things that are not in our best interest. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2653.36s)]
*  I mean, the best example, as I said earlier, the National Association of German Jewry, [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2656.8s)]
*  which was the Jewish division of the Nazi party. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2660.1600000000003s)]
*  And I would encourage all Jews, not just American Jews, but Jews across the world [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2662.88s)]
*  to realize the centrality of the land of Israel, to stand up for Jewish Americans on college [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2666.8s)]
*  campuses and yes, stand up for American values like life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2670.88s)]
*  because those very much are Jewish values. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2675.28s)]
*  All right. Just one last question. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2677.52s)]
*  I want to be super respectful of the time we said we're going to let you go. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2678.7200000000003s)]
*  We have about a minute and a half, two minutes. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2681.1200000000003s)]
*  So I just want to get this one last question in. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2682.5600000000004s)]
*  Just in terms of who's a Jew and who isn't, who's speaking for most of Jews and who aren't, [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2684.48s)]
*  you went to the RNC and you said, I'm voting Republican and voting for Donald Trump [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2690.1600000000003s)]
*  because I think he's the one who's going to combat anti-Semitism and protect Israel. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2694.1600000000003s)]
*  In part, that is absolutely what you said. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2698.48s)]
*  Polls show that three quarters of American Jews, 75 percent, are intent to vote for the [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2701.44s)]
*  Democratic candidate. Only a quarter of American Jews intend to vote the way you intend to vote, [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2707.84s)]
*  which is for Donald Trump. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2712.72s)]
*  Does it not on some level that indicate that you're speaking for a minority of American Jews, [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2713.92s)]
*  not even a majority? [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2717.36s)]
*  Sure. So first of all, I did not endorse Trump at the Republican convention. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2719.6s)]
*  You can watch my speech. I actually took pains not to endorse him. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2722.56s)]
*  It's true. I did endorse him two months later after I'd gone to the Democratic National Convention. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2725.04s)]
*  And after I'd worked behind the scenes with Democratic policymakers to get them more in line [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2730.32s)]
*  with my values. But I took pains not to endorse Trump. And in fact, I ad-libbed a significant [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2733.84s)]
*  amount of my speech at the Republican convention not to endorse Trump. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2738.0s)]
*  So I'm a Democrat. I've only voted for Democrats. I can understand why Jews vote for Democrats [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2741.2000000000003s)]
*  because typically they are more aligned with our values. I would say this, and again, [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2745.52s)]
*  I'm not a partisan. I'm happy to be swayed one way or the other. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2749.44s)]
*  But we are all on the same page. Whether you're voting for Kamala Harris or Donald Trump, [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2752.8s)]
*  Jewish Americans, broadly speaking, want the American hostages to be released from Gaza. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2757.28s)]
*  They want a strong U.S.-Israel relationship. And they want to confront anti-Semitism on college [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2761.76s)]
*  campuses. If they think that Kamala Harris would be the best person for that job, go for it. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2765.76s)]
*  I disagree. I think Donald Trump would be better for those concerns, even though I disagree with [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2770.0s)]
*  him on a whole bunch of other issues. I think it would be a lot better when it comes to issues [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2773.84s)]
*  that primarily affect the Jewish people. But again, I'm not a spokesman. I encourage every [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2778.0800000000004s)]
*  American Jew to make their own choices. I've been very clear why I'm supporting Trump. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2782.7200000000003s)]
*  If people disagree, that's fine because we're all on the same page. We all want what's best, [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2786.7999999999997s)]
*  not just for Jewish Americans, but really for the American people. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2790.56s)]
*  All right. Well, I super appreciate your taking the time. It was a good spirited discussion, [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2793.52s)]
*  which I always find revealing. I hope you stay safe and I wish you the best of luck. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2797.6s)]
*  I'd be happy to talk to you again. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFSBRPbl3yA&t=2803.52s)]
