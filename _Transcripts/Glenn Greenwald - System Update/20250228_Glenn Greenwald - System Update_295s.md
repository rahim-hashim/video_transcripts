# "We Need DOGE for Russia:" Analyst Aleksandr Dugin on Russia's Establishment Problem
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [February 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_k-1UnHytc)
*  I heard once a speech from President Putin, maybe it was an interview, and he referred [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_k-1UnHytc&t=0.0s)]
*  to a certain kind of Russian who feigns patriotism, but really their heart lies in traveling to [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_k-1UnHytc&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  France, traveling to London, they love their foie gras, they love their Western villas [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_k-1UnHytc&t=21.84s)]
*  and that this tension between what he called patriotic Russians and these kinds of Russians [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_k-1UnHytc&t=29.08s)]
*  who crave above all else integration of Russian to this global order and to this European [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_k-1UnHytc&t=35.64s)]
*  set of values that he considers anti-Russian always stayed with me because it really seemed [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_k-1UnHytc&t=42.599999999999994s)]
*  like it came from a very internal place. Is that the kind of group that you're talking [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_k-1UnHytc&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  about? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_k-1UnHytc&t=53.76s)]
*  Yes, that is political elite of 90s because the absolute majority of the people now in [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_k-1UnHytc&t=54.76s)]
*  power, they came in the 90s and they stay here still. The situation is totally changed, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_k-1UnHytc&t=60.239999999999995s)]
*  but nevertheless they keep their places. But Putin preferred not to punish them, not to [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_k-1UnHytc&t=67.67999999999999s)]
*  fight with them, not to do what dodge has to many agencies, but rather to re-educate [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_k-1UnHytc&t=74.56s)]
*  them or maybe to seduce them, to give them place, to give them peace, give them place [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_k-1UnHytc&t=87.88s)]
*  in the power, but they should at least pretend to be patriot. So that is not about the sincerity [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_k-1UnHytc&t=96.2s)]
*  of their conversion, ideological conversion. And Putin tolerates those who maybe with words [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_k-1UnHytc&t=106.88s)]
*  are on the side of the greatness of Russia, of patriotism and so on, but by him he doesn't [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_k-1UnHytc&t=115.32s)]
*  go deeper. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_k-1UnHytc&t=127.24s)]
*  But it sounds like you would like to see a kind of what you're calling dozing of Russia. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_k-1UnHytc&t=128.23999999999998s)]
*  Yes, I think that is the problem. We need dodge for Russia. We need absolutely Russian [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_k-1UnHytc&t=132.56s)]
*  mask. We need people like Tulsi Gabbard, Keshe Patel, Pete Hexett, Kennedy, Robert Kennedy [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_k-1UnHytc&t=138.8s)]
*  and other hero of new Trump's revolution here because we have many, many common points. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_k-1UnHytc&t=148.56s)]
*  The bureaucracy, the huge corruption on any level of Russian society and the treason of [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_k-1UnHytc&t=156.76000000000002s)]
*  Russian interests in favor of some other countries or groups interests. So we have [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_k-1UnHytc&t=165.72s)]
*  the, we are in very similar position and we need Trump's revolution here and dodging [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_k-1UnHytc&t=172.6s)]
*  Russian state and political elites in order to purge this. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_k-1UnHytc&t=179.72s)]
*  It's funny because a lot of anti-Trump liberals believe that Trump has brought the Russian [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_k-1UnHytc&t=184.52s)]
*  transformation to the United States. In other words, you seem to be saying, oh, look, it's [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_k-1UnHytc&t=193.08s)]
*  over there is what we need over here. And a lot of liberals believe that Trump has sort [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_k-1UnHytc&t=197.24s)]
*  of copied Putin. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_k-1UnHytc&t=201.08s)]
*  You see from the distance, you see only best thing on the other side. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_k-1UnHytc&t=202.88000000000002s)]
*  Always your neighbors' grasses greener. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_k-1UnHytc&t=209.72000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. That is about at the same time, what I am admire, I am admiring personally [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_k-1UnHytc&t=211.56s)]
*  how fast and how rapid this velocity of the changes. That is purely American. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_k-1UnHytc&t=218.84s)]
*  Putin makes everything very carefully with delay, one step ahead, two step behind. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_k-1UnHytc&t=228.04s)]
*  And finally, in 25 years, you could not recognize your country. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_k-1UnHytc&t=236.92000000000002s)]
*  Nothing was done. Nothing was declared openly. Nothing was changed. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_k-1UnHytc&t=242.76s)]
*  But everything is already changed. And we didn't remark that with Trump, quite opposites. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_k-1UnHytc&t=250.51999999999998s)]
*  In one month, there is no more ancient regime. There is as much of it. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_k-1UnHytc&t=258.36s)]
*  It's still there, but it's under attack quite openly. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_k-1UnHytc&t=264.76s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_k-1UnHytc&t=268.04s)]
