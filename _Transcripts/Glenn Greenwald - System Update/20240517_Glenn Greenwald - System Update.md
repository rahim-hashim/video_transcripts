# INTERVIEW: Prof. Jeffrey Sachs on "Neurotic" U.S. Fears About China
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [May 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k)
*  Tonight, Professor Jeffrey Sachs is a renowned economist, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=0.0s)]
*  a policy analyst and has held [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  many positions at Columbia University [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=11.96s)]
*  where he is currently a university professor. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=14.58s)]
*  He was on the faculty of Harvard prior to that. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=17.12s)]
*  He has served as Special Advisor to [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=19.78s)]
*  the UN Security Secretary General, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=21.900000000000002s)]
*  is credited with guiding several countries out of [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=24.3s)]
*  major debt crisis over the last four decades, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=27.28s)]
*  and has become in the process one of [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=30.12s)]
*  the nation's most influential scholars [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=31.840000000000003s)]
*  on international relations. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=33.88s)]
*  He has been on System Update several times before. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=35.58s)]
*  He is, for very good reason, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=37.96s)]
*  one of our audience's most popular guest, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=39.6s)]
*  and we are always delighted to talk to him, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=42.18s)]
*  and we are thrilled that we will do so tonight. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=44.34s)]
*  Earlier this week, there was [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=50.44s)]
*  this very interesting development where Victor Orban, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  Prime Minister of Hungary who has become [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=56.4s)]
*  a folk hero to the populist right [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=58.56s)]
*  of the United States and around the world, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=61.2s)]
*  met with President Xi and he's done this many times. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=63.32s)]
*  The relationship between Hungary and China has been growing, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=67.03999999999999s)]
*  it's been solidifying, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=69.72s)]
*  and Orban talked about how the partnership that they have with [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=71.1s)]
*  China is central to Hungary's future prosperity. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=74.32s)]
*  We're seeing this in all the regions where the US used to have [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=77.92s)]
*  full dominance in South America, in Africa, in Asia. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=80.72s)]
*  What role do you think the kind of resentment [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=85.96000000000001s)]
*  toward American foreign policy, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=89.4s)]
*  this perception that America throws its weight around [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=90.8s)]
*  and starts wars, the last time China started a war [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=93.04s)]
*  or was involved in a war was 1979, 45 years ago. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=95.48s)]
*  Is that resentment? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=98.92s)]
*  And by the way, that was basically one month. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=99.76s)]
*  Yeah, one month border dispute basically. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=102.92s)]
*  Yeah, a little punishment of Vietnam [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=104.88s)]
*  for its actions in Cambodia. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=107.28s)]
*  Exactly, exactly, it was a one month war. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=108.96000000000001s)]
*  So is this resentment helping China kind of attract [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=112.64s)]
*  and take away partners and allies from the United States [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=116.68s)]
*  and more broadly, why is China having so much success [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=119.68s)]
*  in getting countries to migrate toward their alliance, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=123.8s)]
*  toward their axis? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=127.84s)]
*  Well, look, basically China is doing a good job [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=129.76s)]
*  of economic development and technological advance [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=135.72s)]
*  and over the period from 1980 until today, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=140.12s)]
*  it's had the most remarkable economic transformation [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=145.12s)]
*  through very high saving, very hard work, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=150.20000000000002s)]
*  unbelievable improvement in educational access and quality. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=154.28s)]
*  They've just done a tremendously good job. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=160.6s)]
*  China remains poorer than the United States per capita [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=163.96s)]
*  remains poorer than Europe per capita, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=167.76000000000002s)]
*  but the advance has been tremendous. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=170.52s)]
*  The improvement of the quality of life has been tremendous. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=172.36s)]
*  And because China is 1.4 billion people compared [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=175.72s)]
*  to the 335 million people in the United States, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=179.20000000000002s)]
*  four times larger, the size of the Chinese economy [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=182.88s)]
*  in absolute terms is larger than the US [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=186.68s)]
*  if you measure it at a common set of international prices, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=189.20000000000002s)]
*  what's called purchasing power adjusted prices. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=192.92000000000002s)]
*  China's done a good job. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=196.23999999999998s)]
*  We should be pleased that 1.4 billion people [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=198.07999999999998s)]
*  have gotten out of poverty. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=201.79999999999998s)]
*  We should be pleased that China is making available [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=203.51999999999998s)]
*  low cost photovoltaics, electric vehicles, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=207.35999999999999s)]
*  wind turbines at low cost, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=211.44s)]
*  the things that could make possible [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=213.16s)]
*  the ecological transformation, the energy transformation. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=215.0s)]
*  Instead, we're in a profoundly neurotic state [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=218.92s)]
*  in the politics in this country's leadership. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=223.68s)]
*  China must be an enemy because it's large and successful. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=227.0s)]
*  Basically what's happening is China is a threat [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=232.72s)]
*  to US hegemony. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=236.24s)]
*  It really is. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=238.24s)]
*  It's not a threat to the US. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=239.4s)]
*  It's not a threat to you. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=241.28s)]
*  It's not a threat to me. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=242.44s)]
*  It's not a threat to taking over the United States at all, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=243.76000000000002s)]
*  but it is a threat to the claim that the US runs the world. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=247.68s)]
*  And that is leading to a neurotic reaction. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=252.64s)]
*  And if you wanna see the neurotic reaction, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=256.71999999999997s)]
*  people should look at Foreign Affairs Magazine, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=259.64s)]
*  which is the magazine of the Council on Foreign Relations, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=262.12s)]
*  the establishment institution. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=265.4s)]
*  Every issue is, are we still number one? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=267.92s)]
*  What are we gonna do? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=270.64s)]
*  How do we stay ahead of China? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=271.48s)]
*  How do we contain China? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=272.76s)]
*  Everything is about China. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=274.0s)]
*  Not because China's threatening us, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=276.64s)]
*  but because China is showing we don't run the world [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=278.8s)]
*  the way we like to think we run the world. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=283.32s)]
*  So most of the world is not gravitating to China. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=286.28000000000003s)]
*  Most of the world is saying, don't make us choose. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=291.92s)]
*  Don't make us be on your side versus China's side. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=295.72s)]
*  We just wanna have life. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=299.72s)]
*  We wanna trade with China. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=301.28000000000003s)]
*  We wanna have a perfectly normal relationship. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=302.92s)]
*  We want them to help us build a fast rail [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=305.92s)]
*  or a new power grid. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=309.44s)]
*  Why are you telling us that if we do it with China, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=312.12s)]
*  we become an enemy of the United States? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=314.92s)]
*  This is where we are so messed up. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=317.56s)]
*  And when China has this big industrial structure, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=321.32s)]
*  we now say, that's overcapacity. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=325.52000000000004s)]
*  This is a term that didn't even exist before. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=328.84000000000003s)]
*  There's no overcapacity in China. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=331.76s)]
*  The world needs what China produces. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=334.32s)]
*  It needs solar modules. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=336.84s)]
*  It needs wind turbines. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=339.04s)]
*  It needs electric vehicles. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=340.2s)]
*  We're in a climate crisis. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=341.64s)]
*  So we need all that stuff. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=343.64s)]
*  We should be encouraging this development. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=345.24s)]
*  We should be encouraging China's making loans [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=348.2s)]
*  and investments in developing countries [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=351.88s)]
*  to help them make their energy transformation. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=353.76s)]
*  But China is a threat to America's delusion [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=356.28s)]
*  that it runs the world. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=361.71999999999997s)]
*  So every time you come on, I always think to myself, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=363.44s)]
*  okay, I wanna spend a lot of time talking about China. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=366.16s)]
*  Obviously a major part of the US-China, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=368.56s)]
*  well, what some people want to be a new Cold War, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=371.92s)]
*  but this adversarial relationship involves [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=374.16s)]
*  international economics and trade, which is your specialty. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=377.2s)]
*  One of them, things in which you've worked for a long time, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=380.68s)]
*  but unfortunately, we always have so many wars [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=382.72s)]
*  that we have to spend so much time talking about [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=385.15999999999997s)]
*  that we only get to spend a little time. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=387.04s)]
*  So hopefully there will be a day in the future. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=389.08s)]
*  I can't envision it now, but let's be optimistic [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=391.4s)]
*  when the US doesn't have a bunch of hot wars [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=393.71999999999997s)]
*  in which it's heavily involved and we can talk more in depth [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=396.2s)]
*  about what the relationship with China should be, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=399.03999999999996s)]
*  what's happening with it, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=401.23999999999995s)]
*  because I consider you such an important voice on that. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=402.28s)]
*  By the way, Glenn, we should do it in part [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=406.67999999999995s)]
*  because not only is the relationship central right now [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=409.32s)]
*  to war and peace and to the future of the world, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=412.88s)]
*  China has a really different perception [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=415.44s)]
*  of international statecraft than the US. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=418.72s)]
*  And it's absolutely fascinating to talk about [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=422.08000000000004s)]
*  because China really views things differently [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=425.0s)]
*  and in fascinating ways and very good for a discussion. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=428.68s)]
*  Yeah, so then we're gonna harass you [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=433.56s)]
*  for a China only conversation [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=435.32000000000005s)]
*  because it's something that I think people [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=437.72s)]
*  in the United States could really benefit from [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=439.44000000000005s)]
*  since all we ever hear is evil China, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=441.12s)]
*  aggressive China, militaristic China. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=443.40000000000003s)]
*  And I think people can benefit [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=445.84000000000003s)]
*  even just from understanding better the Chinese view [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=447.56s)]
*  of the world since we hear so little about that. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=450.52s)]
*  It's always a pleasure to talk to you. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=453.2s)]
*  I think it's extremely nutritious [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=454.56s)]
*  and illuminating for our audience. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSNwIOk09k&t=455.96s)]
