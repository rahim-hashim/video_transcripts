# Ben Shapiro MELTS DOWN Over Trump Deprioritizing Israel
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [May 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY)
*  Now again, I'm not, I don't want to oversell this at all. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=0.0s)]
*  I think I've seen quotes and I've heard things that Trump believes that no one can attack [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  him for not supporting Israel when we're giving billions of dollars a year to Israel. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=17.86s)]
*  So I'm not saying like around the corner the US is going to stop sending billions of dollars [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=21.36s)]
*  a year to Israel or cut them off. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=24.92s)]
*  That's almost impossible to imagine. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=26.44s)]
*  But any sort of reorienting of priorities where we're not placing Israel on an equal [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=29.92s)]
*  plane to US interest or even above as we've been doing could have major positive repercussions [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=36.52s)]
*  in terms of war and other things. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=42.64s)]
*  Now speaking of Israel loyalists, and by the way, my saying that would be outlawed and [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=46.36s)]
*  subject to punishment under this new expanded anti-Semitism hate speech code that Trump [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=53.92s)]
*  is imposing on American colleges is an example of something called anti-Semitism to accuse [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=60.24s)]
*  any Jewish person of having greater loyalty to Israel than their own country. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=66.4s)]
*  But speaking of Israel loyalists, Ben Shapiro of the Ben Shapiro show was patchwork complaining [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=70.4s)]
*  and whining throughout his show that Trump is not doing enough for Israel. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=78.04s)]
*  Trump is deprioritizing Israel. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=85.36000000000001s)]
*  Here's just a little snippet of his rant this morning. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=88.72s)]
*  Clearly what Hamas is attempting to do is basically settle all outstanding business [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=92.24000000000001s)]
*  with the United States so as to then create separation between the United States and Israel [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=97.12s)]
*  in Iran negotiations. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=101.24000000000001s)]
*  That is what is happening with the Houthis as well. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=102.92s)]
*  It is not a coincidence that as the Houthis are basically for swearing attacks on American [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=104.36s)]
*  shipping and the United States is saying that the United States is no longer going to worry [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=109.2s)]
*  about the Houthis essentially, that Hamas is now trying to do the same by releasing [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=113.03999999999999s)]
*  the sole living American hostage in the Gaza Strip, trying to basically say that the United [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=116.16s)]
*  States now has no part in that conflict. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=121.6s)]
*  Well, okay, fine. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=123.6s)]
*  I mean, if the United States has no part in that conflict, then Israel should just go [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=124.6s)]
*  into what they need to do. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=127.6s)]
*  That seems to me a proper solution with regard to the Gaza Strip. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=129.4s)]
*  Do you see how mad he is at the very notion that the U.S. may not consider the war in [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=133.44s)]
*  Gaza to be our war? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=138.64000000000001s)]
*  And I think he's essentially saying that the reason Trump wanted that American out is so [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=140.84s)]
*  that no more arguments can be mounted about why the U.S. has some responsibility to care [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=145.12s)]
*  about the war in Gaza because Americans are held hostage there. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=153.48000000000002s)]
*  Now the whole thing, that whole premise is obscene from the start because this American [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=158.12s)]
*  hostage, as I said, is not just some innocent American civilian who decided to go visit [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=162.28s)]
*  Israel on a tourist trip and got kidnapped by Hamas. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=167.04s)]
*  He was in Israel because he went to Israel to fight in their army. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=171.6s)]
*  He became a soldier in the IDF and he was captured in uniform, on active duty. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=174.72s)]
*  And this idea that if an American citizen goes to fight for some foreign country, like [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=181.76s)]
*  an American goes to fight for Ukraine and gets captured by Russia or an American goes [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=185.64s)]
*  to fight for Russia and gets captured by Ukraine or Iran and gets captured by whoever, whatever [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=189.78s)]
*  foreign country they decide they want to go fight for and wear the uniform of a foreign [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=197.1s)]
*  country doesn't become the U.S. government's responsibility to consider that war now our [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=201.1s)]
*  war because one of our citizens went and enlisted in a foreign army and decided to fight that [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=204.98s)]
*  war. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=211.14s)]
*  But okay, let's assume that he's an American citizen even though he's an Israeli IDF soldier [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=212.14s)]
*  too and therefore the Trump administration should care about getting him out. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=216.42s)]
*  I think that's reasonable. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=220.5s)]
*  They should care, not necessarily make the war their war, but I think it's appropriate [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=221.5s)]
*  for the U.S. government to try and negotiate his release as they did. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=227.29999999999998s)]
*  But now Ben Shapiro is saying, oh, this seems to have been done specifically because Trump [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=232.38s)]
*  wants to say that the war in Gaza is not our war. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=239.89999999999998s)]
*  It isn't our war. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=243.61999999999998s)]
*  It never was our war. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=244.62s)]
*  Hamas has never attacked the United States, has no aspirations to attack the United States, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=247.02s)]
*  has no capabilities to attack the United States. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=250.9s)]
*  They're exclusively a militia of resistance designed to fight against Israeli occupation [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=254.70000000000002s)]
*  of their territory, of their land. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=259.58s)]
*  That's what they are. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=262.5s)]
*  That's in their charter. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=264.54s)]
*  That's historically what they've done. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=266.18s)]
*  That's what they do. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=268.22s)]
*  That's their function. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=269.22s)]
*  I can see why Israel would consider them to be in their own interest but not the United [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=271.22s)]
*  States. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=275.94000000000005s)]
*  Same argument about Ukraine. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=276.94000000000005s)]
*  Ukraine is definitely in Russia's interest. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=277.94000000000005s)]
*  It's right on the other side of their border. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=280.22s)]
*  But how is it in the U.S. interest to fight a war to govern, to determine who governs [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=282.3s)]
*  various provinces in eastern Ukraine? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=288.94000000000005s)]
*  What difference does that make to American citizens? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=290.82000000000005s)]
*  And of course the same is true for the war in Gaza, but Ben Shapiro cannot abide the [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=294.34000000000003s)]
*  notion that the wars of the United States should be fought for American interests and [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=298.7s)]
*  not Israeli interests because he sees no distinction between those two things. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=303.98s)]
*  And also when he says like, oh well fine, if the Americans want to consider Gaza only [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=309.9s)]
*  Israel's war, then the Israelis should go do what they have to do. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=315.82s)]
*  First of all, Israel is doing what they quote unquote have to do. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=318.98s)]
*  Ben Shapiro's like a tough guy. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=322.94s)]
*  Like yeah, then they're going to go in and do what they have to do. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=323.94s)]
*  They're committing genocide. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=329.46000000000004s)]
*  They're ethnically cleansing Gaza right out in the open. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=330.78000000000003s)]
*  They've destroyed all civilian life in Gaza. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=334.70000000000005s)]
*  They've killed tens of thousands of people, including 20,000 children. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=336.70000000000005s)]
*  And there's a report in The Lancet suggesting that that count is much higher. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=343.58000000000004s)]
*  I think clearly that's the minimum count. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=346.90000000000003s)]
*  People are still buried under the rubble and like. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=349.5s)]
*  But also the Israelis can't do anything without American assistance. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=351.74s)]
*  They could never be fighting all these wars in Lebanon and Syria and taking land and occupying [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=358.66s)]
*  the West Bank and bombing the West Bank and cleaning it out and then also fighting the [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=362.38s)]
*  war in Gaza without the US lavishing it with aid and money. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=366.42s)]
*  So if Ben Shapiro really wants to say that okay fine, Gaza is not America's war, then [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=370.38s)]
*  Israel should do what they have to do, then argue that the US should cut off Israel's [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=374.38s)]
*  aid. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=379.66s)]
*  Why should the US keep paying for these wars? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=380.66s)]
*  Forcing the American worker to subsidize Israel. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=383.26000000000005s)]
*  Forcing our armed service members to be deployed in the region to protect Israel. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=387.14s)]
*  Possibly going to a war with Iran to help Israel. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=391.62s)]
*  Here's an NBC report also on these, what they call the strained Trump Netanyahu relationship. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=395.62s)]
*  Quote, disagreements on Iran and Gaza are straining Trump Netanyahu relationship. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=403.62s)]
*  Israel is quote, worried about any deal Trump might strike with Iran, one source told NBC. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=408.14s)]
*  Quote, Netanyahu is blindsided and infuriated this past week by Trump's announcement that [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=414.06s)]
*  the US was halting its military campaign against the Iranian backed Houthis in Yemen after [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=419.65999999999997s)]
*  the Houthis agreed to stop firing on US ships in the Red Sea. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=423.82s)]
*  The Houthis had just attacked Israel with a missile that hit close to Ben Gurion, Israel's [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=428.06s)]
*  main airport. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=432.46s)]
*  When Netanyahu visited the White House last month for the second time since Trump took [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=434.21999999999997s)]
*  office, he hoped the President would pledge US air support for a possible Israeli operation [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=437.34s)]
*  against Iran's nuclear facilities. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=442.42s)]
*  The Israeli leader was taken aback when the President instead announced he would agree [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=445.34s)]
*  to direct talks with Tehran, the diplomat said. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=449.34s)]
*  Quote, I think what you're seeing is the Israelis recognizing that as much as they welcome the [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=452.42s)]
*  election of President Trump and thought that would really give them a blank check to pursue [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=456.34s)]
*  whatever agenda they wanted, Trump has his own agenda. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=461.0s)]
*  Frank Lowenstein, a former Middle East envoy under the Obama administration said during [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=464.62s)]
*  briefing organized by J Street, an advocacy organization that describes itself as both [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=468.5s)]
*  pro-Israel and pro-peace. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=473.34s)]
*  Although Trump's diplomacy with Iran and the US deal with the Houthis are, quote, anathema [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=476.26s)]
*  to Netanyahu, the Prime Minister does not have the political leverage in Washington [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=480.82s)]
*  or in Israel to enter into a direct confrontation with Trump, who is popular with Netanyahu's [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=484.92s)]
*  base in Israel, said Ilyon Goldenberg, who worked as a Middle East policy, admitted to [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=489.65999999999997s)]
*  the Ilyes policy as a senior official during the Biden and Obama administrations. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=494.9s)]
*  And that's why you see Netanyahu pretending that the US and the Yemenis are working, the [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=499.29999999999995s)]
*  US and the Israelis are working together when of course nothing can be further from the [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUVktgpBmnY&t=509.62s)]
