# Liz Truss DENIES Allegations that Boris Johnson Sabotaged Early Ukraine War Peace Talks
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [February 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI)
*  All right. We're with Liz Truss, who's the former prime minister of the United Kingdom [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=0.0s)]
*  here at CPAC in Washington. Thank you so much for joining us. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=10.98s)]
*  Good to be on. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=15.14s)]
*  So you've lately been calling for something approximating a MAGA movement in the United [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=17.22s)]
*  Kingdom. There might be some who would argue that such a movement is already burgeoning [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=23.64s)]
*  if you look at the success of reform in the UK recently. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=28.68s)]
*  That's a political party which is slightly different from a MAGA movement. Or indeed, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=33.24s)]
*  I've also called for a Tea Party movement. But what we need is a grassroots uprising [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=38.84s)]
*  in Britain about what is going on in our country because the problem isn't just in politics, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=45.72s)]
*  it's also in the bureaucracy, it's in the system. So that's why I'm talking about a [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=52.0s)]
*  wider movement of people. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=56.839999999999996s)]
*  And you've also sort of appropriated the term deep state and applied it to the British context. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=59.04s)]
*  You've used that to refer to the civil service and so forth, which we see now being targeted [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=65.44s)]
*  for reforms here. Would you extend that critique, if you like, to the security agencies, the [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=69.64s)]
*  intelligence agencies, MI5, MI6, or those sort of in a different category in your mind [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=78.28s)]
*  in terms of what needs to be reformed? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=82.84s)]
*  I definitely think those organisations need to be accountable. But I would say in Britain, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=86.32000000000001s)]
*  they're less obviously the problem than... So if we take the issue of the Pakistani grooming [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=93.32000000000001s)]
*  gangs, the problems there are in the police and they're in the home office. So those are [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=99.68s)]
*  parts of the bureaucracy and the public service is where the biggest problems are. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=106.84s)]
*  Okay. So when you were foreign minister and then prime minister, Ukraine was a major topic. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=112.44000000000001s)]
*  That's back in the news today. You've variously... I've reviewed some of your statements over [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=119.64s)]
*  the course of the war. You called for the defeat of Russia. You warned against appeasement [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=124.2s)]
*  of Putin. What would defeat of Russia even look like now militarily? How would that be [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=129.88s)]
*  achieved? Would it require the toppling of the Russian government in some form? Like [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=137.52s)]
*  how does your previous calls for the defeat of Russia translate to what's going on now? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=141.92s)]
*  What my concern is and always has been is about Russian expansionism that Putin has [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=146.56s)]
*  laid out. And I think it was back in the Munich Security Conference 2007, but he laid out [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=154.48s)]
*  his vision of a greater Russia, which included pretty much everything that was in the Soviet [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=159.24s)]
*  Union. So my concern is about that expansionism. So what I want to see is I don't [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=165.0s)]
*  want to see Putin rewarded for his aggression in Ukraine. And I want to make sure that Russia [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=171.76s)]
*  is not advancing into Europe. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=178.6s)]
*  And what would a reward look like? Would it be recognition of the annexed oblasts pursuant [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=182.0s)]
*  to some peace deal? Like tangibly, what would be a reward that you would be... [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=187.39999999999998s)]
*  First of all, I'm not... I am not, as I was previously, privy to what is actually going [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=193.0s)]
*  on on the ground now. And I know there's lots of media speculations, lots of reports. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=199.28s)]
*  I think unless you're the person actually looking at the intelligence of what's going [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=203.6s)]
*  on. I remember when I was in the job, like lots of stuff that was reported in the media [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=207.64s)]
*  was completely untrue from our intelligence. So I'm not going to sort of speculate on the [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=212.52s)]
*  current state of the Russian army or the Ukrainian army or the current position. But my... [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=219.16s)]
*  The fundamental principle here is Russia should not be rewarded because that just sends a [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=226.32s)]
*  very bad signal to Putin himself, which would result in further incursions, but also a bad [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=233.88s)]
*  signal to President Xi. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=240.92s)]
*  What's an example? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=243.92s)]
*  I want to see... Why do I support President Trump? Because I believe in a strong America [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=244.64s)]
*  and a strong West. And what we had under President Biden was a weak America and a weak West. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=252.0s)]
*  And he was leading the rest of the West in a very, very negative direction. We're still [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=258.2s)]
*  seeing some of that continuing in European countries under left-wing governments and [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=265.2s)]
*  France and Germany and so on. So what I want to see is I want to see the West win. And [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=269.88s)]
*  the West winning means that our adversaries don't win. And Russia is in League of China. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=276.08s)]
*  They're in League of Iran. We don't want them to win. We want the war to end. Of course [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=282.0s)]
*  we all want the war to end. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=287.68s)]
*  What's an example from your premiership of a time there were misreported media accounts [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=289.32s)]
*  of what the intelligence services were saying? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=294.15999999999997s)]
*  I mean, all the time. I'm not sure I can remember the precise details or even I'm able to [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=297.44s)]
*  actually reveal them, but it was all the time. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=302.4s)]
*  Okay. You mentioned Germany. The German federal elections are this coming weekend. There's [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=305.68s)]
*  been a lot of talk around what the implications would be if the alternative for Germany or [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=311.88s)]
*  AFD gains power. They've had a particular view on Russia issue where they've been skeptical [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=317.52s)]
*  of sanctions, which you were a strong proponent of. What is your assessment of the AFD? And [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=324.8s)]
*  would they like, would you expect them to somewhat moderate their positions? Were they [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=333.24s)]
*  to gain power in some fashion or are they totally out of bounds as you can see it? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=337.08s)]
*  I mean, I first of all, I think every political party should have a right to participate in [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=343.36s)]
*  election. And I get very worried about the censorship issue and parties being censored [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=348.71999999999997s)]
*  or not able to participate. I think that's completely wrong. I think the German people [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=356.32s)]
*  should be able to vote for the AFD if that's what they want. Absolutely. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=360.52s)]
*  So they shouldn't be prescribed by the state. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=364.64s)]
*  I mean, I just think it's appalling. And it goes back to this thing that what systems [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=366.71999999999997s)]
*  are now trying to do in Europe is sort of set tram lines for what's acceptable and what's [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=375.03999999999996s)]
*  not acceptable. And going back to my premiership, that was the problem that essentially the [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=382.03999999999996s)]
*  Civil Service and the Bank of England were trying to set tram lines for what is acceptable [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=388.52s)]
*  economic policy according to their views. And that's the increasing trend in the European [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=392.47999999999996s)]
*  Union of saying these things are or aren't acceptable. Like when they intervened in Poland [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=399.35999999999996s)]
*  over what they were doing in the justice system. Obviously they're not intervening now Donald [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=403.79999999999995s)]
*  Tusk in charge. That's totally different. But under the Law and Justice Party, they [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=408.59999999999997s)]
*  were trying to intervene. And I think these attempts to push politicians into tram lines [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=412.6s)]
*  ultimately will fail because the public will ultimately revolt against policies they don't [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=420.84s)]
*  like. And you've seen that in particular in the case of migration. Migration was, there's [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=427.76s)]
*  been a lot of pressure on European countries to accept certain levels of migrants. And [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=433.68s)]
*  that is resulting in people looking for other parties to vote for at the election. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=438.96s)]
*  One thing that struck me about British politics is that particularly in the realm of foreign [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=445.79999999999995s)]
*  policy there's more uniformity between the two major parties than maybe the case elsewhere [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=449.84s)]
*  such as in the United States. Not all the time. But on the issue of Ukraine in particular, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=455.64s)]
*  and the Conservatives basically have one mind on that issue, maybe with some marginal differences. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=461.8s)]
*  But now, for example, Keir Starmer has called for the deployment of some European peacekeeping [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=468.88s)]
*  force to Ukraine in league with Macron in France and perhaps others. And that seems [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=473.76s)]
*  relatively in keeping with what you might support or what others, but you can correct [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=481.24s)]
*  me if I'm wrong. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=485.44s)]
*  I'm not in favour of British troops on the ground. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=485.96s)]
*  You're not, okay. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=487.84s)]
*  I'm not in favour of that. I mean, on Ukraine I think there is more unanimity and actually [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=488.40000000000003s)]
*  it's a reflection of what the British public want. There's great support from the British [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=493.84000000000003s)]
*  public and people are very fearful of further war and conflict in Europe. But on the issue [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=498.6s)]
*  of Israel, I think there is a big split between Conservatives and Labour. Labour have been, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=507.04s)]
*  they put an arms, a partial arms embargo on Israel. They've accepted the ICC court judgment [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=513.68s)]
*  on Netanyahu, which I think is completely wrong. They've been appeasing Islamists in [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=519.8s)]
*  Britain. So on Israel, there's complete disagreement on foreign policy. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=525.4s)]
*  Speaking of Israel, Donald Trump, I'm sure you know, made a rather brash proposal for [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=532.76s)]
*  the United States to quote, take over Gaza. We don't really have the... [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=537.0799999999999s)]
*  I'm looking forward to it. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=542.28s)]
*  Okay. We don't really have the full specifics of it. Maybe they'll rename it Gaza Lago [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=543.28s)]
*  with casinos and hotels or something. Do you find that to be a plausible proposal to turn [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=549.92s)]
*  Gaza into some sort of US military protectorate? [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=555.04s)]
*  I think Donald Trump is an out of the box thinker. And I think in some of these difficult disputes [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=558.36s)]
*  that have been running for a long time and after the appalling attacks of October the [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=566.08s)]
*  7th, new ways of doing things need to be thought of. And if you look at the big foreign policy [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=574.12s)]
*  success of Trump's first term, the Abraham Accords, that was by thinking differently. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=581.2s)]
*  So I'm all for that. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=586.6800000000001s)]
*  The Abraham Accords though, in fairness, didn't really address the Palestinian issue, which [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=588.36s)]
*  is now blown up. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=592.44s)]
*  I'm talking of innovative views of foreign policy that are going to achieve different [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=593.44s)]
*  results. That's what I'm talking about. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=600.8000000000001s)]
*  Do you think innovative is the right word to describe potentially doing a mass expulsion [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=603.0s)]
*  of 1.8 million people? That's what Trump called for. Maybe it's bluster, we don't know, but [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=607.86s)]
*  I don't know. I can maybe think of some other adjectives. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=612.0s)]
*  You don't know is the point. You don't know is the point. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=613.9200000000001s)]
*  One of Trump's advantages when it comes to diplomacy is his unpredictability. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=618.8s)]
*  He's repeated this proposal over and over now, so it's not just some off the cuff thought [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=626.52s)]
*  he apparently had. I mean, he seems to be pushing it cogently. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=630.68s)]
*  Do you think it's practicable? Let's say it were to be implemented. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=638.12s)]
*  I just don't think it's the way to think about what he's been saying. I think you're sort [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=641.92s)]
*  of trying to interpret it in a way that it's not meant. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=648.42s)]
*  I want to ask you about something that's been a bone of contention for quite a while in [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=655.9s)]
*  terms of the initial stages of Ukraine policy. You've heard it widely alleged that Boris [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=661.0999999999999s)]
*  Johnson, when you were foreign minister, he had a trip to Kyiv and it was in the midst [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=667.86s)]
*  of a stage of potential negotiations between Ukraine and Russia in the Istanbul format, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=674.86s)]
*  where perhaps there might have been an early ceasefire brokered in exchange for certain [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=682.42s)]
*  concessions. The theory has it that Boris Johnson, perhaps [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=686.38s)]
*  as an emissary of Joe Biden, exerted some sort of pressure that discouraged Ukraine [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=691.9s)]
*  from continuing on in those negotiations because they understood that they would get a steady [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=697.58s)]
*  supply of weapons systems and continue the war. Does that narrative have any truth to [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=702.24s)]
*  it or do you dispute it? If it is true, I certainly don't know anything [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=707.6800000000001s)]
*  about it and I don't particularly think it's true. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=712.6800000000001s)]
*  You were foreign minister at the time, right? I'm saying. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=716.12s)]
*  You would probably know, right? Probably, yeah. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=719.96s)]
*  I briefly mentioned the Reform Party in the UK and how you might distinguish it from, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=726.96s)]
*  I guess, a MAGA movement. It is a party. It maybe has some perhaps libertarian bents to [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=732.1600000000001s)]
*  it. Do you anticipate for there to be some collaboration in terms of whatever remains [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=738.9200000000001s)]
*  of the Conservative Party and the Reform Party? Will there be a pact or alliance? [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=748.0s)]
*  Would you be in favor of that? I don't think it's unlikely given the people [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=753.08s)]
*  involved. What would my ideal government be after the next General Lunch? I think there's [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=755.32s)]
*  a good opportunity to put together the best of Reform and the best of the Conservatives, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=766.6s)]
*  but I don't necessarily think that's likely to happen. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=770.44s)]
*  Is that because of Richard Tice or Nigel Farage or the personalities at the top of that party? [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=773.96s)]
*  The makeup of the Conservative Parliamentary Party. I think there'll be quite a few MPs [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=778.64s)]
*  who just aren't in favor of any kind of deal with Reform. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=784.32s)]
*  Is that because they are maybe more aligned still with the pro-EU tendency within the [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=788.96s)]
*  party? More aligned to the left, definitely. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=794.96s)]
*  How sizable are they after the last general election? Do they wield ... because you've [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=799.6800000000001s)]
*  had a lot of people have left Parliament since ... including yourself since 2024. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=804.8s)]
*  I described the results of the 2024 election as survival of the wettest. And the wettest [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=808.64s)]
*  is the British term. I think you call it squishy. So that's the makeup of the Parliamentary [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=814.88s)]
*  Party is more in that direction. Hence why I don't think there'll be a deal. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=822.4799999999999s)]
*  How is your reception in the United States ... because I know you attended the inauguration [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=828.3599999999999s)]
*  of President Trump last month. I recall seeing you at the Republican Convention last summer [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=833.16s)]
*  in Milwaukee. Now you're here. How is your reception here in the US compared to in Britain [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=839.48s)]
*  when ... how to put it ... sometimes you're the object of scorn in the ... [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=846.48s)]
*  I'm the object of scorn for the British establishment. That's not the reaction of ordinary people [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=852.48s)]
*  in Britain. It's the reaction of a very powerful media and elite class. And they're the problem. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=858.5999999999999s)]
*  Does that include Rishi Sunak? Well I would say he's more in that group than [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=870.0799999999999s)]
*  otherwise, yes. Have you ever ... when's the last time you [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=873.88s)]
*  spoke to Donald Trump? Last year. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=877.8s)]
*  Really? What was that about? How did it go? I'm not going to go into details about it. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=881.88s)]
*  Oh really? Was it confidential? Yes. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=887.16s)]
*  Okay. Fair enough. Fair enough. Are we close to big ... [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=890.12s)]
*  Would you like to finish? I'll ask a final question. In your book you open with a scene [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=896.12s)]
*  from the Queen's final days. And that was a very interesting period. It was that she [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=905.24s)]
*  died about 24 hours after you assumed the premiership of memory service. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=915.56s)]
*  Two days. How did you deal with that in terms of ... [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=920.56s)]
*  It's hard to imagine anybody coming into office with more kind of psychic turmoil than that. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=929.4s)]
*  I mean did you ... have you spoken to other heads of government about what that was like? [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=934.4s)]
*  It was an extraordinary time. It was an extraordinary time. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=938.4s)]
*  What lessons do you take from that going forward if any? [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=942.4s)]
*  There's not really much lessons you can take about a sovereign who'd been on the throne [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=945.4s)]
*  for 70 years dying because that's a pretty unusual event. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=951.4s)]
*  Same. And how is the King doing? [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=955.4s)]
*  He's doing very well. He's doing very well. And I think the British monarchy is something [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=959.4s)]
*  in our constitution that works. Because sometimes King Charles is ... [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=966.4s)]
*  Unlike the fake Tony Blair stuff that ... [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=970.4s)]
*  Because sometimes King Charles has been lambasted by certain people on the right for being in [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=972.4s)]
*  favor of certain climate initiatives and so forth. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=976.4s)]
*  It's just misunderstanding British politics which is he isn't involved in politics. He's just not involved. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=978.4s)]
*  He's a constitutional monarch. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=985.4s)]
*  And that's the way you'd like to see it remain. Not remain in the EU. That's over. But remain in the monarchy. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=989.4s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=996.4s)]
*  Liz Trust, thank you so much. Appreciate it. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=998.4s)]
*  Hope to see you there. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSbasfjUJI&t=1026.4s)]
