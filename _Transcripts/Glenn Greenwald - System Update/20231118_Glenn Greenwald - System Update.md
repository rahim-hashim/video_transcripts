# EXTREME: Big Tech Censors Viral Osama bin Laden Letter | SYSTEM UPDATE
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [November 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A)
*  So as we covered last night, The Guardian removed this letter to Osama, by Osama bin [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=0.0s)]
*  Laden, letter to Americans that he wrote in 2002 to explain that Muslims don't hate the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=11.88s)]
*  United States because of their freedoms are freedoms. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=17.32s)]
*  Instead, Muslims hate the United States, some of them do, because of a long list of grievances [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  about US interference in that part of the world, sanctioning Iraq and killing hundreds [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=25.28s)]
*  of thousands of Iraqi children, overthrowing democratically elected governments and imposing [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=29.4s)]
*  brutal secular dictatorships that are there to serve the United States and keep majority [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=34.519999999999996s)]
*  opinion in those countries suppressed, bombing and invading innocent people in those countries, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=40.04s)]
*  putting troops on Saudi Arabia and the soil that they consider sacred and supporting Israel [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=48.36s)]
*  in its wars against the Palestinians and their taking to Palestinian land. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=52.32s)]
*  Those are their grievances. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=56.2s)]
*  You should not agree with those grievances, but you should want to know them. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=57.2s)]
*  There's a reason, if you're a historian of World War II, you have to study the grievances [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=61.800000000000004s)]
*  of Adolf Hitler. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=67.2s)]
*  You have to listen to his speeches and his interviews and his writings. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=68.2s)]
*  You have to understand German resentment about the Treaty of Versailles that was imposed [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=73.36s)]
*  on Germany and humiliated and broke Germany after World War I. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=77.08s)]
*  Many people consider the Treaty of Versailles to be a mistake because of what it did to [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=79.84s)]
*  Germany. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=84.04s)]
*  It radicalized Germany. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=85.04s)]
*  It drove them into the arms of Hitler. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=86.04s)]
*  They're amenable to his grievances. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=87.88000000000001s)]
*  Nobody thinks that historians are just citizens who try and understand Nazi Germany and have [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=90.32000000000001s)]
*  read Mein Kampf, which is available in every bookstore on every campus because it should [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=96.88000000000001s)]
*  be. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=102.0s)]
*  No one thinks that people who read the works of Adolf Hitler to try and understand Nazi [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=103.0s)]
*  Germany or any other Nazi German leaders are doing so because they agree with Nazism or [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=106.92s)]
*  are fans of Nazi Germany. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=112.36000000000001s)]
*  What everyone understands is that they're reading that to understand what happened in [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=114.2s)]
*  Germany as part of understanding what happened in both World War I and World War II. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=117.80000000000001s)]
*  Only anti-intellectual idiots think that if you study a Hitler speech, it means you're [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=123.52000000000001s)]
*  a Nazi. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=128.6s)]
*  And yet, I can't tell you how many people seem to believe that people over the last [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=129.6s)]
*  48 hours or 72 hours, young Americans who discovered this letter from Osama bin Laden [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=137.4s)]
*  and led them to believe they were lied to about 9-11 because they were told that the [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=143.51999999999998s)]
*  Muslims hated the United States because of our freedoms, when in reality there was a [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=146.51999999999998s)]
*  long list of grievances about American interference in that part of the world. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=149.56s)]
*  Whether you agree with it or not, of course people should know about that, about an incredibly [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=153.76s)]
*  important event like 9-11. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=158.56s)]
*  You shouldn't want people to be ignorant so they can be propagandized. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=160.76s)]
*  You should want them to have the full picture. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=163.56s)]
*  And that's why the letter from Osama bin Laden has been on the Guardian's website for 21 [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=166.44s)]
*  years, because it is a matter of public interest. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=170.28s)]
*  It's a historical document that informs and gives context to what happened. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=172.4s)]
*  And yet, when people started reading it, no longer in connection to criticizing the United [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=178.4s)]
*  States or thinking that the United States played a role in that attack, but now reading [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=184.32000000000002s)]
*  it to understand the Israeli conflict, suddenly that letter became something you could not [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=188.56s)]
*  read. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=194.84s)]
*  The Guardian took it off its own site after 21 years of keeping it there because too many [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=195.84s)]
*  people were reading it. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=200.20000000000002s)]
*  We covered that on last night's show, and now it has gone much more extreme. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=203.04s)]
*  We have a major act of big-text censorship. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=208.6s)]
*  TikTok, one of the most popular social media sites in the country, by far the most popular [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=210.79999999999998s)]
*  for young Americans, has announced that people are banned from henceforth talking about the [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=214.79999999999998s)]
*  Osama bin Laden letter or speaking about its contents. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=222.83999999999997s)]
*  From NBC News, November 17th, TikTok removes hashtag for Osama bin Laden's quote, letter [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=227.06s)]
*  to America after viral videos circulate. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=232.28s)]
*  The Guardian also pulled the text of the Al-Qaeda founder's letter from its website after people [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=235.04000000000002s)]
*  cited it on TikTok and X. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=240.86s)]
*  Quote, throughout the week TikTok users had been sharing the link to the Guardian's transcripts [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=243.78s)]
*  of bin Laden's letter, which was written about a year after the September 11th, 2001 terrorist [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=247.8s)]
*  attacks which killed nearly 3,000 people in the United States. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=253.58s)]
*  The Guardian took the letter down from its website Wednesday. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=256.46000000000004s)]
*  In the letter, bin Laden addressed the American people and sought to answer the following [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=261.65999999999997s)]
*  questions. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=264.94s)]
*  Why are we fighting and opposing you? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=265.94s)]
*  And what are we calling you to? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=268.53999999999996s)]
*  And what do we want from you? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=269.97999999999996s)]
*  The letter includes anti-Semitic language and homophobic rhetoric. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=273.62s)]
*  The virality of the letter has reignited criticism of the platform, which is owned by China's [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=277.21999999999997s)]
*  bite dance. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=282.7s)]
*  The app has faced mountain scrutiny in the last year as the US and other countries argued [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=284.78s)]
*  it poses a threat to national security. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=289.06s)]
*  Since Hamas' October 7th attack on Israel, critics of the app have alleged that it is [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=292.26s)]
*  using its influence to push content that is anti-Israel and contrary to US foreign policy [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=296.94s)]
*  interests. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=301.62s)]
*  TikTok has said the allegations of bias are baseless. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=302.62s)]
*  Researchers at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue said they found 41 Letter to America [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=307.26s)]
*  videos on TikTok. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=311.26s)]
*  While TikTok has now blocked Letter to America from within its search function, those videos [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=313.38s)]
*  are still easily accessible. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=318.78s)]
*  Bin Laden's letter condemns US support for Israel and accuses Americans of aiding the [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=320.97999999999996s)]
*  oppression of the Palestinian people. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=324.7s)]
*  Bin Laden also denounced US interventions in Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia, Kashmir, Chechnya, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=328.41999999999996s)]
*  and Lebanon. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=333.7s)]
*  And then TikTok justified it by saying content that promotes terrorism is banned. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=336.97999999999996s)]
*  Now this idea that TikTok is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, I know this is [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=343.85999999999996s)]
*  something a lot of people believe, the Biden administration has tried to convince people [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=348.7s)]
*  of this. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=351.94s)]
*  Because the game that is being played is the CIA and the FBI are telling TikTok we're going [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=353.94s)]
*  to ban you from our country if you don't turn over content moderation decisions to us. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=357.34s)]
*  We influence what Facebook and Google and Twitter allow. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=365.46s)]
*  And if you don't allow us to influence what you allow, then we're going to ban you from [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=371.18s)]
*  our country as a threat. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=374.52s)]
*  And so as a result, TikTok has increasingly outsourced its content moderation decisions [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=375.84s)]
*  to the US security state because the owners of TikTok are capitalists and want to make [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=381.2s)]
*  money and they make a lot of money from staying in the United States. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=385.71999999999997s)]
*  They don't want to be banned there. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=387.91999999999996s)]
*  And that's why TikTok just went and did something extraordinary. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=390.96s)]
*  It banned any discussion of this 2002 letter from Osama Bin Laden to Americans so that [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=395.12s)]
*  can no longer have access to or insight into the version of Al Qaeda about why they had [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=401.2s)]
*  anti-American sentiment. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=408.88s)]
*  Now you can only listen again to the official version from the US government. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=410.2s)]
*  We spent so much time on the Twitter files and all these attempts to censor conservative [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=416.47999999999996s)]
*  speech and now if you have a major big tech platform censoring one of the most important [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=422.15999999999997s)]
*  historical documents of the last 20 years, the war on terror, the 9-11 attack and the [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=430.2s)]
*  war on terror was in arguably the most significant and transformative event in the United States [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=433.64s)]
*  in the last 25 years. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=438.92s)]
*  It ushered in enormous amounts of authoritarian measures into the United States. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=442.0s)]
*  It led to several different wars in multiple countries around the world. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=448.32s)]
*  It led to drone bombings and the institution of torture regimes and Guantanamo and due [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=455.8s)]
*  process free camps and kidnapping regimes. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=460.48s)]
*  It transformed American political and legal culture. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=466.36s)]
*  It's a major historical event. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=471.08000000000004s)]
*  And when you have a letter from the leader of Al Qaeda accused of perpetrating that attack, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=473.72s)]
*  explaining why he did it, the fact that it's now banned, that you are not allowed to read [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=477.92s)]
*  that social media has said this is too dangerous to allow young American adults to see is exactly [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=481.76s)]
*  the kind of big tech censorship that people have been screaming bloody murder about and [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=487.28000000000003s)]
*  yet there's very little protest here because the people who have been complaining about [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=491.08s)]
*  big tech censorship, which has mostly been conservatives in the American right, don't [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=496.84000000000003s)]
*  want people reading Osama Bin Laden's letter. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=502.84000000000003s)]
*  So you think it's like heretical to even entertain the possibility that maybe US policy [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=506.76s)]
*  caused what the CIA describes as blowback. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=513.4399999999999s)]
*  That if you go around the world bombing people and killing their civilians, including their [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=517.96s)]
*  children and interfering in their politics and overthrowing their leaders and imposing [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=522.8s)]
*  dictatorships on them, they're going to get kind of angry about it. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=528.72s)]
*  That's one of the costs of doing that. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=533.08s)]
*  And the Bin Laden letter illustrates that cost. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=535.6s)]
*  And a lot of people don't want anyone else to understand that or to see it. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=539.24s)]
*  And so people are happy that big tech has banned this letter. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=542.2s)]
*  This is one of the most profound acts of political censorship on the internet in the last six [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=545.72s)]
*  years. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=550.76s)]
*  And if you've been complaining about big tech censorship of conservative speech, but don't [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=552.84s)]
*  find this troublesome, at least as troublesome if not more so, you don't actually believe [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=557.6s)]
*  in free speech, you're not actually opposed to censorship. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=562.4s)]
*  In the same way that so many people claim to find cancel culture so dangerous and yet [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=567.12s)]
*  stood by and cheered while so many people lost their job in the last six weeks in America [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=571.36s)]
*  for commenting negatively on the Israeli war or on US policy in support of it. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=576.16s)]
*  Here's what happens if you go to TikTok as we did and search Letter to America, which [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=581.6s)]
*  one of the most popular terms over the last three days or four days, here you see what [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=589.68s)]
*  censorship actually looks like. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=595.52s)]
*  Sorry, no results found. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=597.0799999999999s)]
*  Try a different keyword in your next search. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=598.4399999999999s)]
*  Just not going to show it to you. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=600.28s)]
*  That is what censorship looks like in its purest form. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=604.4399999999999s)]
*  Here is Senator Mark Warner, who is a Democratic senator from Virginia on Face the Nation talking [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=609.5s)]
*  about this yesterday. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=617.64s)]
*  You want guardrails, I imagine, set up with China on artificial intelligence and the like. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=623.5600000000001s)]
*  But legislating around a lot of this is really hard and it's not moving very quickly. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=628.12s)]
*  Now, Margaret, let me tell you, I did the bill that was terribly bipartisan, 13 and [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=634.36s)]
*  13 Democrats, Republicans about saying we need an approach that's not simply focused [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=639.5600000000001s)]
*  on TikTok, but on all foreign technology that might pose a national security risk from China [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=644.82s)]
*  or Russia or Iran. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=650.46s)]
*  And suddenly we had the extremes on both the left and the right come out against that legislation. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=652.1800000000001s)]
*  It needs to move because particularly now, as you see, literally 40 percent. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=656.74s)]
*  If you are opposed to the DC bipartisan establishment passing bills to control political speech [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=661.5600000000001s)]
*  on the Internet, it means that you are just an extremist either on the left or the right, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=668.72s)]
*  the losers in life, the fringe marginalized radicals, the serious people want our government [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=672.82s)]
*  to tell big tech, including TikTok, what they can and can't allow. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=682.46s)]
*  And so we don't like the bin Laden letter. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=685.82s)]
*  We don't want our citizens reading the bin Laden letter. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=687.6600000000001s)]
*  Tech knock needs to ban it on command. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=690.0600000000001s)]
*  And that's what they did. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=691.74s)]
*  A ton of young people get all their news from TikTok. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=692.74s)]
*  So I hope those kind of issues will be we can get some energy behind them now coming [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=696.98s)]
*  after this summit. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=700.8800000000001s)]
*  But this technology competition, we've had military competitors like Russia. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=702.5400000000001s)]
*  We've never had an economy that's making the investments the way China is in these new [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=706.26s)]
*  technology domain. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=710.5400000000001s)]
*  And just to show you how bipartisan it is here, Senator Marsha Blackburn of Kentucky, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=712.74s)]
*  the Republican from Kentucky, one of the most ardent war supporters in this country, basically [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=717.6600000000001s)]
*  the Nikki Haley of the Senate. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=725.02s)]
*  She agrees fully with Senator Warner, the Democrat from Virginia, quote, on Chinese [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=727.6600000000001s)]
*  own TikTok. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=730.78s)]
*  The latest trend is for young people to praise Osama bin Laden's 2002 letter to America. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=732.38s)]
*  TikTok is poisonous. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=736.86s)]
*  Ban it. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=738.06s)]
*  Now, let me just say again. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=741.38s)]
*  To read Osama bin Laden's letter and to understand the perspective of America's enemy so we can [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=744.74s)]
*  better understand history is no more praising Osama bin Laden than it is when people try [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=751.3399999999999s)]
*  and understand the German perspective to understand what led to World War II, the election of [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=758.62s)]
*  Adolf Hitler, Nazism and the Holocaust. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=763.0600000000001s)]
*  It's what adults do. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=767.0200000000001s)]
*  We look at everything that's relevant to try and place things in historical context and [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=768.74s)]
*  have a complete understanding of them. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=772.46s)]
*  Do you see how they treat you like children? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=775.7s)]
*  They don't want you reading a historical letter. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=777.7s)]
*  They don't want you seeing what the other side has to say. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=779.6600000000001s)]
*  Remember, the US government after 9-11 told the networks to ban all interviews with Osama [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=782.26s)]
*  bin Laden. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=786.86s)]
*  They didn't want Americans hearing from him then either because they wanted to keep Americans [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=787.94s)]
*  in ignorance and they could say the only reason these people attacked us is because you're [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=792.74s)]
*  so free and they hate you for it. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=796.98s)]
*  They didn't want Osama bin Laden being heard by Americans saying you've been nonstop engaging [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=800.42s)]
*  in violence and interfering in our country and our politics and our government and our [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=806.54s)]
*  culture and our religion for decades. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=810.1s)]
*  Because they knew if people heard from him what just happened on TikTok, which is a bunch [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=814.18s)]
*  of young Americans were going to be like, wait a minute, I didn't realize this. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=820.06s)]
*  I didn't know this is why they were angry because we've been going around bombing them [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=824.54s)]
*  and occupying them and invading them and overthrowing their governments and imposing dictatorships [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=828.02s)]
*  on them for years. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=832.5799999999999s)]
*  If you even remotely believe in free speech, you should be indignant at the attempt to [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=835.18s)]
*  keep Americans from knowing this. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=839.06s)]
*  That is what tyrannical governments do. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=841.66s)]
*  They block out information they don't want their citizens to have. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=843.58s)]
*  And they're using big tech to control the internet to do it. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=848.9000000000001s)]
*  That's what this banning of Osama bin Laden's letter is about. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=851.74s)]
*  It's why the Guardian removed the letter from its website. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=854.0200000000001s)]
*  And the people who have spent the last five years ranting and raving about big tech censorship [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=859.7s)]
*  of political speech who are now happy about this, I see you all, I've seen you all doing [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=863.98s)]
*  this. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=869.7800000000001s)]
*  You are the people who are the most craven people ever. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=871.7s)]
*  At least the liberal left censors admit they like censorship. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=874.94s)]
*  You've been pretending for five straight years that you're indignant about it, except when [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=878.34s)]
*  the censorship is applied to your actual political enemies, people who defend the Palestinian [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=883.1s)]
*  cause, who criticize Israel, the Osama bin Laden letter, you want censorship because [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=887.7s)]
*  we're back in 2002 Fox News world where everything is jingoistic and authoritarian in the extreme [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=893.46s)]
*  With the sole difference being that back in 2002 at least we had the excuse that we were [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=900.62s)]
*  actually attacked. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=905.26s)]
*  We weren't attacked this time. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=908.54s)]
*  A foreign country was attacked, one that Americans happen to identify with a great deal, many [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=909.74s)]
*  of them do. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=914.34s)]
*  And that's why we have the same climate because people are treating this as an attack on the [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=916.9s)]
*  United States. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=919.94s)]
*  Even though it was actually an attack on Israel. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=923.34s)]
*  A lot of people don't differentiate that way. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=925.46s)]
*  Now, one of the people who has been trying to bring this message to the American public [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=930.34s)]
*  for a long time is not Noam Chomsky on the far left, though he has been doing that. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=936.7s)]
*  He's also been saying, look, there's reasons why we were attacked on 9-11 having to do [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=944.5s)]
*  with their own behavior. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=947.94s)]
*  But that was also a message brought to the public by Ron Paul when he ran for president [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=950.7s)]
*  twice in 2008 and then 2012, the Republican congressman from Texas. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=954.78s)]
*  And he used the Osama bin Laden letter to try and get Americans to understand that there [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=960.86s)]
*  is a cost to all these neocon wars. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=964.54s)]
*  That if you want to go around the world bombing countries all the time and killing people, [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=967.3399999999999s)]
*  you're not going to be able to get away with it by sitting in peace and not having people [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=971.3399999999999s)]
*  want to bring violence back to you. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=977.14s)]
*  That is human nature. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=980.42s)]
*  If you occupy countries, if you subject people to foreign rule, if you bomb them and their [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=981.46s)]

*  So basic human nature. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=994.74s)]
*  But very dangerous to the warmongering military industrial complex, which is why they don't [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=997.46s)]

*  Needless to say, and I mean needless to say, it's unnecessary to say, that he was accused [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1009.78s)]
*  of justifying 9-11, which he was not doing. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1016.14s)]

*  But here's what he said in that debate. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1026.46s)]
*  Intervention was a major contributing factor. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1028.46s)]
*  Have you ever read about the reasons they attacked us? [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1030.6200000000001s)]
*  They attack us because we've been over there. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1034.52s)]
*  We've been bombing Iraq for 10 years. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1036.76s)]
*  We've been in the Middle East. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1039.58s)]
*  I think Reagan was right. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1040.74s)]
*  We don't understand the irrationality of Middle Eastern politics. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1042.82s)]
*  So right now we're building an embassy in Iraq that's bigger than the Vatican. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1047.06s)]
*  We're building 14 permanent bases. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1052.22s)]
*  What would we say here if China was doing this in our country or in the Gulf of Mexico? [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1054.1399999999999s)]
*  We would be objecting. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1058.78s)]
*  We need to look at what we do from the perspective of what would happen if somebody else did it to us. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1059.78s)]
*  Are you suggesting we invited the 9-11 attack, sir? [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1064.98s)]
*  Do you see that? [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1067.6599999999999s)]
*  They don't understand the difference between causation and justification. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1069.94s)]
*  Ron Paul was explaining the costs of going around and bombing people constantly and interfering [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1076.18s)]
*  in other parts of the world. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1081.18s)]
*  They're going to want to bring violence back to us. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1082.18s)]
*  He didn't even remotely suggest that it was justifiable for them to kill American civilians [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1085.6599999999999s)]
*  in numbers of 3,000. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1091.7s)]
*  But the minute you try and say we should think about why people hate us, why so many people [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1095.22s)]
*  want to bring violence to our country, that's the accusation you face. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1100.5s)]
*  Oh, well, if you want people understanding Bin Laden, you must think 9-11 is justified. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1105.8600000000001s)]
*  You must want to be trying to defend Osama Bin Laden and al-Qaeda. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1111.16s)]
*  I mean, it's so childish and imbecilic. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1115.3s)]
*  It should require no explanation, and yet it does. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1122.06s)]
*  That because you want to understand why people do things does not mean that you support what [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1125.76s)]
*  they do. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1130.74s)]
*  If someone is a serial killer, we try and understand what happened in their childhood [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1133.58s)]
*  that caused that. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1136.8999999999999s)]
*  We don't just say, oh, they're evil. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1139.4199999999998s)]
*  We try and understand what motivated it. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1140.62s)]
*  That doesn't mean we approve of the serial killing because we tried to understand the [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1142.4199999999998s)]
*  causes of it. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1145.74s)]
*  We try and understand the causes of bad behavior all the time. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1148.62s)]
*  We try and understand the causes of drug addiction or crime or violence or sociopathic behavior. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1151.1999999999998s)]
*  Understanding the cause of something is different from whether you justify it or think it's [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1159.7199999999998s)]
*  a positive thing. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1163.06s)]
*  This is so basic. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1164.36s)]
*  If I tell you if you smoke four packs of cigarettes a day, you're highly likely to get lung cancer, [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1166.4399999999998s)]
*  it doesn't mean that if you get lung cancer, I'm going to be happy about it and think you [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1174.1599999999999s)]
*  deserved it. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1177.3999999999999s)]
*  I'm just observing the causality, the causation, the causal relationship between the behavior [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1178.72s)]
*  and the result. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1183.3600000000001s)]
*  Approval or disapproval or justifiability is a completely separate topic. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1186.72s)]
*  But the way they try and suppress discussion of what causes people to want to attack our [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1191.0800000000002s)]
*  country is to accuse everybody who raises that issue, like you just saw with Ron Paul, [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1196.4s)]
*  of trying to justify what Osama Bin Laden did. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1201.2800000000002s)]
*  Listen to the rest of this. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1206.24s)]
*  I'm suggesting that we listen to the people who attacked us and the reason they did it. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1208.5600000000002s)]
*  And they are delighted that we're over there because Osama Bin Laden has said, I am glad [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1214.1200000000001s)]
*  you're over on our sand because we can target you so much easier. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1218.8400000000001s)]
*  They have already now since that time have killed 3,400 of our men and I don't think [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1222.76s)]
*  it was necessary. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1227.64s)]
*  Wendell, may I make a comment on that? [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1228.64s)]
*  That's really an extraordinary statement. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1231.1200000000001s)]
*  That's an extraordinary statement. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1232.52s)]
*  That's Rudy Giuliani now about to imply that Ron Paul is some sort of terrorist lover or [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1235.08s)]
*  whatever because of what he tried to get Americans to understand about Neocon wars. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1239.52s)]
*  We want to live through the attack of September 11, that we invited the attack because we [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1243.9199999999998s)]
*  were attacking Iraq. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1249.0s)]
*  I don't think I've ever heard that before and I've heard some pretty absurd explanations [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1250.0s)]
*  for September 11. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1253.8799999999999s)]
*  Those are the Republican big donors and lobbyists who were behind Rudy Giuliani. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1261.04s)]
*  They thought Rudy Giuliani was the best candidate to win the nomination. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1264.76s)]
*  The same people who were applauding Jeb Bush in 2016 whenever he would criticize Donald [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1270.48s)]
*  Trump. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1274.52s)]
*  But this was the view of the Republican Party back then. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1275.76s)]
*  It was right out of Fox News. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1278.96s)]
*  If you even hint that the United States was doing things in the Middle East that provoked [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1281.52s)]
*  an attack, it means you are on the side of Bin Laden. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1287.12s)]
*  Look at that sustained applause. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1300.9599999999998s)]
*  I don't think I've ever heard a applause that enduring before in a presidential debate. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1301.9599999999998s)]
*  You listened to Ron Paul, what he said. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1308.9199999999998s)]
*  Was that offensive to you? [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1310.84s)]
*  If we go around bombing everyone in the world or a particular region and interfering with [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1314.0s)]
*  their politics, they're going to want to bring that violence back to us. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1318.6000000000001s)]
*  That's all he said. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1324.4s)]
*  That's how repressive the culture was then about anything relating to 9-11 and war and [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1326.1200000000001s)]
*  critiques of our government. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1330.92s)]
*  That is the climate that has been replicated now often by the same people who built it [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1332.3600000000001s)]
*  then. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1336.4s)]
*  Congressman, to withdraw that comment and tell us that he didn't really mean that. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1337.4s)]
*  I believe very sincerely that the CIA is correct when they teach and talk about blowback. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1342.44s)]
*  When we went into Iran in 1953 and installed the Shah, yes, there was blowback. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1353.68s)]
*  The reaction to that was the taking of our hostages. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1361.2s)]
*  That persists. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1364.2s)]
*  If we ignore that, we ignore that at our own risk. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1365.2s)]
*  If we think that we can do what we want around the world and not incite hatred, then we have [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1368.8s)]
*  a problem. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1374.84s)]
*  They don't come here to attack us because we're rich and we're free. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1375.9199999999998s)]
*  They attack us because we're over there. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1380.24s)]
*  What would we think if we were... [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1384.04s)]
*  He then goes on to say, if you're an American, what would you have to say if China was putting [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1387.2s)]
*  military bases in our country or bombing various parts of our country? [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1394.04s)]
*  Do you think we would be angry at China, want to attack China? [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1399.28s)]
*  I think we would. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1401.72s)]
*  Now, be on Rudy Giuliani's side of this debate if you want. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1403.84s)]
*  At least we were allowed to have the debate back then in 2008 after our own country was [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1407.12s)]
*  attacked. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1411.48s)]
*  Now we're not allowed to have that debate. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1413.56s)]
*  Ron Paul was referencing the Osama bin Laden comments, the explanation about why people [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1416.3999999999999s)]
*  wanted to bring violence to the United States. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1421.76s)]
*  That is banned. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1423.96s)]
*  The Guardian withdrew it from its site. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1426.24s)]
*  TikTok banned any discussion of it. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1428.44s)]
*  Big Tech has suppressed it. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1432.1200000000001s)]
*  So has the media. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1433.76s)]
*  And anyone who mentions it is accused instantly of being pro-terrorist. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1436.52s)]
*  We're back to that climate of post-9-11, Fox News dominated, Neocon dominated repression. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23Hs75Zk8A&t=1441.64s)]
