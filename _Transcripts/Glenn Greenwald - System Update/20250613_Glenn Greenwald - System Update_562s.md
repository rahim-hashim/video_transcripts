# Netanyahu has Wanted War with Iran for DECADES
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo)
*  Just to give you a sense for how long this goes back, and we've shown you this before, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=0.0s)]
*  I had a debate with Alan Dershowitz last year in New York on the question of whether the [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=10.48s)]
*  US should strike Iran's nuclear program. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=14.6s)]
*  Shockingly, he wants the US to. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=17.36s)]
*  And I went through 15 minutes of news articles going back many, many years where we were [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  and the Israelis were warning that the Iranians were seconds away from getting a nuclear bomb. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=26.259999999999998s)]
*  We had no choice but to attack because they're about to get one. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=31.14s)]
*  But I didn't realize how far back even then that it went. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=35.06s)]
*  Here from the United Press International, which used to be the big wire service along [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=37.58s)]
*  with AP, is April 24, 1984. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=41.86s)]
*  The Ayatollah bomb is in production for Iran. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  That's the headline. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=50.22s)]
*  Iran is moving, quote, very quickly toward production of a nuclear bomb and could have [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=51.22s)]
*  such a weapon within two years, the authoritative Jane's Defense Weekly reported today. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=56.26s)]
*  Jane's quoted news reports as saying production on Iranian nuclear Ayatollah Khomeini's nuclear [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=61.82s)]
*  bomb was, quote, entering its final stages and that construction would follow completion [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=66.26s)]
*  of a nuclear power plant being built with the help of West German experts. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=71.7s)]
*  Jane's Weekly editor Robert Hutchinson said although the report originated with the Arabian [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=76.62s)]
*  Gulf Press, quote, we checked it out and it seems to stand up. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=80.52s)]
*  The indications are that Iran, the Iranians are moving that way and moving that way very [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=83.84s)]
*  quickly. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=89.0s)]
*  That's 1984, five years after the Iranian Revolution. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=90.0s)]
*  So that's basically 40 years ago, a little bit over 40 years ago. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=97.17999999999999s)]
*  Here from Ynet News, which is part of the Israeli press, this is April of 2015. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=102.32s)]
*  This is from a 1992 article in Hebrew that Ynet republished. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=108.76s)]
*  Here is the headline. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=115.72s)]
*  Netanyahu in 1993 says this, Iran will have a bomb by 1999. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=116.72s)]
*  The Prime Minister has been warning for over 20 years that Tehran is close to achieving [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=123.02000000000001s)]
*  its pursuit of nuclear weapons. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=127.60000000000001s)]
*  Quote, the most dangerous threat to Iran's existence, to Israel's existence, does not [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=130.20000000000002s)]
*  lie in the Arab countries but in Iran. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=136.02s)]
*  Then MK, member of parliament, Benjamin Netanyahu wrote, and I call him in February 1993, quote, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=138.14000000000001s)]
*  the rulers of Iran have said repeatedly that they will have an Islamic bomb and that its [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=143.86s)]
*  first target will be Israel, he argued in a piece titled, quote, the greatest danger, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=147.98000000000002s)]
*  claiming that Iran will develop its first nuclear bomb by 1999, which at the time this [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=152.38s)]
*  report was 16 years ago. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=158.66000000000003s)]
*  It's now 26 years ago and it didn't happen. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=160.74s)]
*  Netanyahu, who served as a member of the Knesset at the time, wrote about the Iranian regime [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=163.7s)]
*  22 years ago saying that, quote, it is our duty to make sure in advance that the regime [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=168.14s)]
*  will not obtain the tools necessary to realize its aspirations. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=173.01999999999998s)]
*  Here from the New York Times, January of 1995, Iran may be able to build an atomic bomb in [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=178.85999999999999s)]
*  five years, US and Israeli officials fear. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=183.62s)]
*  It's 30 years ago. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=186.94s)]
*  Here from 20 years ago, NBC News, December 2005, Netanyahu warns of Iran's nuclear threat. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=190.22s)]
*  Iran should take, quote, bold and courageous action against arch-foe Iran's nuclear program, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=196.38s)]
*  similar to its 1981 airstrike on the main Iraqi atomic reactor. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=201.42s)]
*  Former President, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday, Israeli officials [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=206.18s)]
*  have said that unless stopped, Iran will achieve the know-how to build a bomb by March of next year. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=209.98s)]
*  The Israeli loyalist, Jeffrey Goldberg, now the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, wrote [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=218.73999999999998s)]
*  a cover story on exactly this issue in September of 2010, that's 15 years ago, called The Point [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=222.73999999999998s)]
*  of No Return, where he essentially says he went to Israel. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=227.42s)]
*  Everybody agrees that Iran is about to get a nuclear weapon. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=231.66s)]
*  This is sort of the window where it's kind of the last chance of being able to stop Israel [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=235.54s)]
*  from doing so. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=243.22s)]
*  This is 15, 16 years ago. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=244.46s)]
*  Here is Netanyahu in one of his most notorious appearances. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=248.62s)]
*  It's amazing, this is 2012, it seems like this was just so recently, but it just shows [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=254.54s)]
*  how long the same propagandistic narrative has been deliberately disseminated, notwithstanding [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=259.7s)]
*  the fact that we all heard the same thing about Iraq, only for it to be proven untrue. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=266.98s)]
*  This is Netanyahu, he went to the United Nations, he had a cartoon-like graphic designed to [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=273.58s)]
*  convey the urgency and the eminence of stopping Iran, and here's what he said. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=278.26s)]
*  This is a bomb, this is a fuse. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=303.29999999999995s)]
*  In the case of Iran's nuclear plans to build a bomb, this bomb has to be filled with enough [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=308.94s)]
*  enriched uranium, and Iran has to go through three stages. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=316.85999999999996s)]
*  The first stage, they have to enrich enough low enriched uranium. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=323.73999999999995s)]
*  The second stage, they have to enrich enough medium enriched uranium. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=330.3s)]
*  And the third stage and final stage, they have to enrich enough high enriched uranium [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=336.66s)]
*  for the first bomb. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=343.94s)]
*  Where's Iran? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=347.02s)]
*  Iran's completed the first stage. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=349.7s)]
*  Took them many years, but they completed it, and they're 70% of the way there. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=353.58s)]
*  Now they're well into the second stage. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=360.1s)]
*  And by next spring, at most, by next summer, at current enrichment rates, they will have [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=364.94s)]
*  finished the medium enrichment and move on to the final stage. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=371.65999999999997s)]
*  From there it's only a few months, possibly a few weeks. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=378.74s)]
*  For those of you listening and don't remember this graphic, it was not only extremely crude [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=383.14000000000004s)]
*  and primitive, almost laughably so, but the part of the final stage showed a fuse with [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=387.70000000000005s)]
*  the bomb exploding, with a kind of little cartoon-like explosion like you would see [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=395.42s)]
*  on the Road Runner. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=400.3s)]
*  I'm probably dating myself with that reference, but that was a cartoon where they were constantly [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=402.58000000000004s)]
*  blowing things up, blowing themselves up. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=407.1s)]
*  It was that sort of Sunday morning cartoon graphic for kids warning the world this was [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=408.86s)]
*  2012, almost 15 years ago, about how Iran could be months away from actually making [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=414.14s)]
*  the bomb. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=421.94s)]
*  Here from Harit in September of 2020, so this is five years ago, Iran would have enough [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=422.94s)]
*  fissile missile for nuclear bomb by the year's end, U.S. official says. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=428.46s)]
*  I mean, isn't it remarkable how repetitious all of this is and how redolent it so obviously [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=433.18s)]
*  is of what we were told in the run-up to the Iraq War? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=441.78s)]
*  Saddam Hussein was on the market buying aluminum tubes that only had one purpose, which is [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=448.22s)]
*  to build nuclear weapons, already had an active biological weapons program, we only had a [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=453.5s)]
*  small amount of time before we could stop him from gaining nuclear weapons, because [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=457.06s)]
*  if he did, he would pass them to his close friends in Al-Qaeda, an alliance invented [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=461.46s)]
*  by Jeffrey Goldberg while at the New Yorker. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=467.46s)]
*  It's remarkable how the propaganda never changes, and in their defense, I suppose, the reason [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=471.94s)]
*  it doesn't change is because it constantly works. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=478.7s)]
*  Here's CNN last year, Secretary of State Antony Blinken says Iran's nuclear weapon breakout [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=483.53999999999996s)]
*  time is probably down to one to two weeks. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=488.86s)]
*  These same articles over and over for going back, and I didn't realize this, 40 years [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=495.06s)]
*  to the 80s. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=502.94s)]
*  I thought it began in the late 90s when I had prepared that list with Professor Dershowitz [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=504.90000000000003s)]
*  last year, we've given you this list before, but it's remarkable how constant and almost [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=509.90000000000003s)]
*  identical these warnings have been, always with the same goal, to rile Americans into [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=518.84s)]
*  a state of fear about Iran so that the United States once again goes and fights a war in [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=523.4s)]
*  the Middle East that is against Israel's enemies and that Israel wants for its own interest [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=529.88s)]
*  a war to be fought. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2fwOl84xo&t=533.88s)]
