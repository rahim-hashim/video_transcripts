# Enduring Media Lies And Myths About Julian Assange: DEBUNKED
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [June 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ)
*  All day today, in response to the news about Assange being released, just a tsunami of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=0.0s)]
*  lies and propaganda from every major media outlet, trying to justify, obviously, why [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=12.36s)]
*  it is that Assange spent so much time in prison only for us to, our government to release [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=18.92s)]
*  him and let him go free with outstanding trial. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=23.36s)]
*  Now, the fact that it was the Biden administration that agreed to release him meant that these [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=27.08s)]
*  media outlets that are completely pro-Biden couldn't criticize the Biden administration. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=32.28s)]
*  That's not what they do. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=37.44s)]
*  So, they were willing to say, yeah, I guess it's fine that we finally let him out, but [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=38.44s)]
*  they also had to justify why he deserved to be in prison. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=42.44s)]
*  And I actually forgot how many lies, and when I say lies, I mean things I can prove to you [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=46.6s)]
*  and will prove to you are actually false, have always been spread all over the media [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=52.06s)]
*  to justify Assange's imprisonment. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=58.02s)]
*  Either these people have no idea what they're talking about or they're actively lying or [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=61.660000000000004s)]
*  both, but these are the media outlets, like this CNN interview I'm about to show you, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=65.42s)]
*  that incessantly claim that they're here to combat disinformation. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=69.94s)]
*  And yet, they spread constant demonstrable lies. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=75.26s)]
*  So, Caitlin Collins, a CNN host, had on her show to talk about the Assange case. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=79.1s)]
*  Not any members of those press freedom and civil liberties groups who denounce this as [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=85.34s)]
*  the gravest threat to press freedom. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=90.03999999999999s)]
*  She decided to invite on her show an FBI official, former FBI official, and not just any former [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=92.32s)]
*  FBI official, but Andrew McCabe, who was kicked out of the FBI in disgrace because he got [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=100.1s)]
*  caught admitting, essentially, that he was motivated by anti-Trump animus in the FBI's [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=107.76s)]
*  investigation that led to all the Russiagate hoaxes. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=115.88000000000001s)]
*  She's talking about a career-proven liar who, of course, CNN immediately went and hired. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  And watch the claims that Caitlin Collins allowed Andrew McCabe to make about Julian [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=124.92000000000002s)]
*  Assange and why he's not a journalist and why he's actually a criminal, because so many [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=130.92000000000002s)]
*  of these claims are provably false. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=135.8s)]
*  You may recall the 2010 leak included hundreds of thousands of confidential military records [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=166.4s)]
*  about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=171.8s)]
*  Under the plea deal, the roughly five years in prison that US prosecutors were seeking [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=174.60000000000002s)]
*  for Assange would be equal to the time that he already served in a British prison. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=178.92000000000002s)]
*  Remember, President Biden said a few months ago that he was considering ending the prosecution [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=183.04000000000002s)]
*  against him. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=187.48000000000002s)]
*  I want to talk about this with Andrew McCabe, the former FBI Deputy Director. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=188.48000000000002s)]
*  Obviously, this is a huge step down, Andrew McCabe, from the 18 charges, the potential [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=192.68s)]
*  175-year prison sentence that he was facing. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=197.32s)]
*  What do you make of the terms that prosecutors have come to with Julian Assange? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=201.20000000000002s)]
*  You know, you're right, Caitlin. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=205.0s)]
*  It's a far cry from the charges that were brought against him, but I think it's the [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=207.24s)]
*  right call at this point. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=211.56s)]
*  So just look at this. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=213.88s)]
*  CNN wants to talk about the imprisonment of somebody who reported on the crimes of the [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=216.04000000000002s)]
*  US government and who they invite on, the former FBI Deputy Director. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=221.76s)]
*  And again, not just any FBI former Deputy Director, but one whose career was destroyed [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=228.6s)]
*  because of corruption lying. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=236.24s)]
*  So here's what he says. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=238.46s)]
*  In this saga, and you know, don't get me wrong, I think that the charges and the indictment [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=239.88s)]
*  of the prosecution of Julian Assange is entirely appropriate. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=245.28s)]
*  Julian Assange was indicted by a grand jury in the Eastern District of Virginia, a grand [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=249.12s)]
*  jury who listened to the entire investigation and determined there was probable cause to [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=254.44s)]
*  believe he committed a crime. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=258.4s)]
*  OK, just on that point, that is, I'm not going to say that's a lie, but it's, everybody [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=260.2s)]
*  knows that's incredibly misleading. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=266.08s)]
*  There's that old adage that you can indict a ham sandwich in a grand jury. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=268.2s)]
*  A grand jury is a process where only the government appears. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=273.44s)]
*  The defendant has no right to appear. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=276.58s)]
*  There's no counter evidence presented to the grand jury to conflict with or negate [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=278.7s)]
*  any of the government's claims. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=285.65999999999997s)]
*  So it's a meaningless process. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=287.68s)]
*  It's a rubber stamp that the grand jury will always give in essentially every case, an [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=289.0s)]
*  indictment. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=295.14s)]
*  And only a propagandist would try and claim that the validity of Assange's criminality [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=296.14s)]
*  was demonstrated because they got a grand jury to indict him. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=300.65999999999997s)]
*  to see how they concluded that because the facts here are not in dispute. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=305.88s)]
*  He did what the law says you cannot do. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=309.7s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=312.74s)]
*  He solicited that information. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=313.74s)]
*  He published that information, gave it to people who weren't entitled to receive it. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=315.21999999999997s)]
*  But at this point, we are many, many, many years into this prosecution. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=319.5s)]
*  And I think the fact that continuing to try to extradite him, to bring him here, to hear [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=324.62s)]
*  those charges, to face those charges in court really raises significant questions, concerns [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=328.74s)]
*  about what sort of precedent that result might have on legitimate journalistic activity. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=334.56s)]
*  Let me just stop there because he said, and this is obviously a lie, that there's no dispute [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=341.92s)]
*  that Julian Assange did that which the law says you cannot do. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=348.08s)]
*  And what he said that the law says you cannot do is solicit sources to bring you classified [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=352.28s)]
*  information and then publish that information without the consent of the government. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=358.38s)]
*  That is something that every major media outlet in the world does every day. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=365.4s)]
*  Here, for example, is this instrument called SecureDrop, which was actually created by [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=369.36s)]
*  a internet freedom activist named Aaron Schwartz. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=377.24s)]
*  It was then taken over by the Freedom of Press Foundation, which I co-founded with, Laura [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=380.6s)]
*  Poitras and Daniel Ellsberg and others principally to support WikiLeaks. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=384.8s)]
*  And it's a technological device that allows media outlets to tell sources, if you want [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=388.90000000000003s)]
*  to leak to us, all you have to do is upload these secret documents to us and that will [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=395.90000000000003s)]
*  give you anonymity. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=402.66s)]
*  And here's the organizations that use them, the Washington Post, the Guardian, the Intercept, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=403.66s)]
*  TechCrunch, I believe the New York Times uses it now. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=408.38s)]
*  And they don't use all very similar ones. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=411.22s)]
*  So these media outlets do exactly what Andrew McCabe just described was indisputably a crime, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=413.14s)]
*  namely encouraging sources to give them classified information and then publishing that classified [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=420.71999999999997s)]
*  information without the consent of the government. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=426.47999999999996s)]
*  And that's exactly why if you accept this indictment, it means that every journalistic [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=429.8s)]
*  outlet in the country can be prosecuted. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=435.56s)]
*  Now here are the two eyes that he actually tells that I want to show you and demonstrate [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=438.8s)]
*  the proof of the lie. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=443.26s)]
*  On the legitimate journalistic activity. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=445.46000000000004s)]
*  Well, I mean, it's notable to hear you say that. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=447.34000000000003s)]
*  Obviously his team argued that he should be protected by the same laws that journalists [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=450.1s)]
*  are, that he was releasing sensitive information but in the public's interest. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=454.3s)]
*  And so, you know, he's been alternatively celebrated by some and reviled by others. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=458.86s)]
*  And so it is striking for me to hear you, given your former position as the deputy FBI [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=465.26s)]
*  director, to say you think this is the right call. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=471.12s)]
*  I do think it's the right call. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=473.59999999999997s)]
*  And don't get me wrong. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=475.48s)]
*  I think Julian Assange did the wrong thing. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=477.48s)]
*  Julian Assange hurt the United States government. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=480.08s)]
*  He put the lives of our troops in danger. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=482.59999999999997s)]
*  He put the lives, particularly of Iraqi citizens who had helped our effort in the war in Iraq [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=484.71999999999997s)]
*  in danger. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=490.76s)]
*  So this guy did a lot of bad things. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=491.76s)]
*  But what he did, some of what he did was very similar to the way the journalists conduct [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=494.06s)]
*  their business. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=499.3s)]
*  Of course, in other ways, very different, right? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=500.3s)]
*  There wasn't any of those conversations prior to publication that journalists typically [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=502.18s)]
*  have when they're going to reveal classified and sensitive information to find out what, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=506.08000000000004s)]
*  you know, reach out to the government entity involved to find, let them seek comment and [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=511.54s)]
*  then have a conversation, give the government an opportunity to say, hey, please don't do [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=516.0600000000001s)]
*  this because these people might die as a result. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=519.44s)]
*  So very big differences there. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=521.78s)]
*  But the fact is that going forward with this prosecution would run the risk of putting [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=524.0799999999999s)]
*  all of those processes and those protections kind of up for grabs. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=530.8s)]
*  And that could set a very dangerous precedent going forward and have a chilling effect [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=535.92s)]
*  on the journalistic news gathering process and how that impacts the First Amendment. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=541.3199999999999s)]
*  OK, now, one of the reasons he's obviously saying he agrees with what the Biden administration [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=545.8399999999999s)]
*  did is because he's a pro-Biden hack. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=550.42s)]
*  But he made two arguments about why Julian Assange is different than what he considers [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=552.9399999999999s)]
*  to be journalists. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=561.3199999999999s)]
*  And I don't think there's anything more dangerous than having the FBI or CIA operatives decide, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=562.3199999999999s)]
*  oh, this is a real journalist, but this is not. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=567.34s)]
*  Those are the last people you should want making those decisions. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=570.14s)]
*  Because obviously, the people they consider to be real journalists are the people they [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=574.3199999999999s)]
*  can control. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=576.96s)]
*  And since they can't control Assange, then they don't consider him a real journalist. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=578.28s)]
*  But the more important point is that if you actually read the First Amendment, it lists [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=583.06s)]
*  a series of rights, freedom of speech, the free exercise of religion, and a free press, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=586.88s)]
*  to name a few. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=596.88s)]
*  And none of those is limited to some special priesthood called journalists. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=598.12s)]
*  You don't have to be a journalist, whoever decides what that is, to claim the right of [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=603.9s)]
*  free press freedoms under the Constitution that is an activity, like speech or the free [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=609.02s)]
*  exercise of religion, that is available to all citizens. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=614.78s)]
*  And so anybody, journalist or pilot or engineer or architect or just regular citizens, have [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=619.8199999999999s)]
*  the right to engage in press freedoms under the Constitution. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=627.06s)]
*  You don't have to prove that you're a journalist. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=630.14s)]
*  The argument that he gave as to why he joined Assange is different from the respectable [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=633.82s)]
*  journalists who he thinks should be protected is because according to McCabe, Assange never [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=640.0600000000001s)]
*  contacted the government in advance before publishing secret information to give the [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=647.14s)]
*  government an opportunity to be heard about which particular documents might be dangerous [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=651.66s)]
*  or put people in harm's way before he published them. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=657.6600000000001s)]
*  He simply published them without ever contacting the government. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=661.88s)]
*  That's what Andrew McCabe said on CNN today with no pushback from Caitlin Collins. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=664.6s)]
*  That is an absolute lie. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=669.9399999999999s)]
*  It is just a completely demonstrable falsehood. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=671.84s)]
*  Here is Foreign Policy Magazine in 2010, and I was involved in this at the time I reported [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=675.96s)]
*  on this at the time, I remember it very well. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=685.08s)]
*  Julian Assange contacted the State Department before releasing diplomatic cables and said, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=687.88s)]
*  look, we have a bunch of diplomatic cables that we think are in the public interest to [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=693.72s)]
*  know, but we would like you to give you the opportunity to tell us which ones you think [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=698.04s)]
*  we shouldn't publish because they actually might engage in, they actually might cause [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=703.08s)]
*  danger that we can't anticipate but that you might know. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=708.48s)]
*  In other words, WikiLeaks and Assange did exactly what Andrew McCabe this morning on [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=711.28s)]
*  CNN insisted he never did. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=716.08s)]
*  And in response, the State Department under Hillary Clinton refused to engage in that [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=720.4000000000001s)]
*  process with WikiLeaks and said, we're not going to talk to you at all. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=724.96s)]
*  Here from Foreign Policy November of 2010, the State Department refuses to negotiate [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=728.0400000000001s)]
*  with WikiLeaks, quote, the State Department wrote Saturday to the leaders of the self-described [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=733.08s)]
*  whistleblowing website, WikiLeaks, telling them the US government won't negotiate ahead [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=737.2800000000001s)]
*  of the expected release of hundreds of thousands of sensitive documents. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=741.6s)]
*  The State Department's top legal advisor, Harold Koh, wrote Saturday to WikiLeaks founder [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=745.68s)]
*  Julian Assange and his attorney, Jennifer Robinson. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=749.92s)]
*  In response to a letter WikiLeaks sent the same day to the US ambassador to the UK, Louis [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=753.28s)]
*  Sussman, the State Department rejected WikiLeaks' request, rejected their request for the names [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=758.56s)]
*  of any individuals who quote, may be at significant risk of harm due to the release of sensitive [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=765.3s)]
*  documents. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=771.16s)]
*  They weren't looking to negotiate with the State Department. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=773.58s)]
*  They were engaged in the practice that, as Andrew McCabe said, all journalists before [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=775.5600000000001s)]
*  they published secret information do, which is you call the government and you don't look [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=780.5600000000001s)]
*  for permission. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=784.5200000000001s)]
*  You just tell them, I'm going to publish these documents. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=785.5200000000001s)]
*  But if you have arguments to make about why there may be dangers that I don't see to publishing [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=787.74s)]
*  certain documents, I'm willing to listen. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=793.12s)]
*  Andrew McCabe on CNN this morning insisted that what differentiates Julian Assange from [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=796.22s)]
*  real journalists is that Assange refuses to do that. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=801.3199999999999s)]
*  He never did it. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=803.5999999999999s)]
*  And in fact, Julian Assange did exactly that in many occasions, including in 2010. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=804.5999999999999s)]
*  But the State Department refused to talk to him. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=810.8399999999999s)]
*  It's just, I just, I just can't, it just, it drives me crazy that CNN runs around constantly [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=812.56s)]
*  saying how they combat disinformation and they're repeatedly putting falsehoods on the [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=820.6999999999999s)]
*  air like that. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=825.1999999999999s)]
*  And I showed this on social media today. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=827.16s)]
*  I'm going to send it to Caitlin Collins and I guarantee you they won't correct it because [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=830.3s)]
*  they are happy to publish absolutely false claims as long as it serves the cause that [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=835.46s)]
*  they want. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=841.78s)]
*  Now the other claim Andrew McCabe made, which is the most common one, is that the reason [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=842.78s)]
*  why Julian Assange should be imprisoned is because documents he published endangered [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=847.1800000000001s)]
*  the lives of multiple people, including Iraqi informants. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=854.74s)]
*  I defy anybody to show one document WikiLeaks published that endangered in any way the life [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=861.08s)]
*  of a single person. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=867.32s)]
*  And in fact, McClatchy, which was a part of Night Ridder, the only major media outlet [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=869.52s)]
*  before the war in Iraq that got the story about Iraqis at WMDs correct, they were constantly [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=874.84s)]
*  publishing articles saying there was no evidence of Iraqi at WMD. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=880.2s)]
*  In 2010, they investigated these claims from the Pentagon that WikiLeaks has blood on [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=884.14s)]
*  their hands, that they endangered the lives of a huge number of people. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=890.3s)]
*  And here's what they concluded. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=894.38s)]
*  Here's McClatchy, September 25th, 2010. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=895.5s)]
*  The date on the article is 2013 because they went back three years later and did a minor [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=900.42s)]
*  correction but the actual date of publication is 2010. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=904.52s)]
*  And the headline is, officials may be overstating the danger from WikiLeaks. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=908.14s)]
*  Quote, American officials in recent days have warned repeatedly that the release of documents [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=911.96s)]
*  by WikiLeaks could put people's lives in danger. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=916.9200000000001s)]
*  But despite similar warnings ahead of the previous two massive releases of classified [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=920.9200000000001s)]
*  U.S. intelligence reports by the website, U.S. officials concede that they have no evidence [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=924.7600000000001s)]
*  to date that the documents led to anyone's death. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=932.48s)]
*  And again, all of these documents are documents that WikiLeaks partnered with the New York [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=937.36s)]
*  Times and The Guardian to publish. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=941.18s)]
*  And both those newspapers as well as WikiLeaks went to the government beforehand and said, [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=943.56s)]
*  if there are documents in here that you think endanger people, tell us what they are. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=949.1999999999999s)]
*  And many of those documents were in fact redacted to protect the lives of innocent people. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=954.16s)]
*  But it is commonplace to hear over and over people like this saying, WikiLeaks put the [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=960.4s)]
*  lives of people in danger with these publications. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=966.7199999999999s)]
*  They have no analysis about why what they did was different than the New York Times [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=970.64s)]
*  and The Guardian. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=975.34s)]
*  In every single case, you go back and look at the Snowden release or the release of the [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=976.46s)]
*  Pentagon papers, the government always claims release of these documents put people's lives [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=980.54s)]
*  in danger. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=985.9399999999999s)]
*  I spent years after doing the Snowden reporting when people said that, and they often did, [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=988.22s)]
*  saying, give me one example of one document that put anyone's life in danger and nobody [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=992.98s)]
*  ever could. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=999.26s)]
*  Same with the Pentagon papers. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1000.92s)]
*  Nobody's life was endangered by the Pentagon papers. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1003.38s)]
*  The only people who are endangered by these leaks are the criminals inside the U.S. government [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1005.4s)]
*  whose crimes end up being revealed. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1012.46s)]
*  But you would think if a FBI deputy director went on to CNN to claim that these WikiLeaks [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1016.34s)]
*  documents published with the New York Times and The Guardian put people's lives in danger, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1022.66s)]
*  someone like Caitlin Collins would say, well, how specifically did they do that? [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1027.18s)]
*  Which documents did the New York Times and The Guardian and WikiLeaks publish and whose [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1030.9s)]
*  lives ended up being endangered? [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1035.2s)]
*  Or they would refer to this investigation showing that even the government admitted [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1038.0s)]
*  they had no evidence to justify that claim. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1041.76s)]
*  Or there would be pushback when Andrew McCabe just lies and said, WikiLeaks, unlike other [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1044.94s)]
*  journalists, doesn't contact the government before publication when clearly that is exactly [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1049.74s)]
*  what he did. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1055.12s)]
*  So here is, just to give you a sense of the kinds of lies and the way they circulate, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1056.2199999999998s)]
*  here's what Mike Pence said. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1063.52s)]
*  And of course, he has been a defender of the U.S. security state his entire life. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1065.8799999999999s)]
*  He went on to Twitter today and said, quote, Julian Assange endangered the lives of our [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1069.32s)]
*  troops. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1074.0s)]
*  Again, absolutely baseless claim. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1075.0s)]
*  In a time of war and should have been prosecuted to the full extent of the law. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1078.0s)]
*  The Biden administration's plea deal with Assange is a miscarriage of justice and dishonors [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1084.24s)]
*  the service and sacrifice of the men and women of our armed forces and their families. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1089.0800000000002s)]
*  There should be no plea deals to avoid prison for anyone that endangers the security of [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1094.46s)]
*  the military or the national security of the United States ever. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1099.2s)]
*  Now, obviously, nobody endangered the security of the United States more than, say, the people [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1103.0600000000002s)]
*  who lied the country into war in Iraq, creating the vacuum there that led to ISIS, people [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1108.54s)]
*  like Mike Pence. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1113.98s)]
*  Here's some goon who worked for the CIA for 10 years named Gail Helt. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1116.78s)]
*  She went on to X today and wrote the following, quote, folks, Julian Assange is no hero. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1123.14s)]
*  He is a despicable Russian asset. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1129.7s)]
*  Obviously, there's never been proof of that. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1131.98s)]
*  Who harmed hundreds of people and dismissed them like they didn't matter. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1134.78s)]
*  That same claim. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1139.22s)]
*  I'm OK with the plea agreement because I hope it means I'll see his name in my social media [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1140.46s)]
*  feed a lot less. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1144.82s)]
*  But let's not venerate the man. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1146.26s)]
*  He caused great harm. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1147.58s)]
*  And there you see her biography. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1150.82s)]
*  She was a CIA analyst from 2013 to 2003 to 2014 during the Iraq War, during the war on [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1152.94s)]
*  terror. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1160.38s)]
*  So, of course, she wants Julian Assange in prison. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1161.38s)]
*  And of course, she is pretending she supports the plea deal because she doesn't want to [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1165.18s)]
*  criticize the Biden administration. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1169.3799999999999s)]
*  And then she goes on separately to say this, quote, a journalist. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1171.82s)]
*  Someone had said, but you're imprisoning a journalist. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1176.62s)]
*  And she said, who was a journalist Assange? [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1178.58s)]
*  That's an insult to actual journalists who do the work with integrity, who I hold an [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1182.82s)]
*  enormously high regard. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1187.3s)]
*  Now, as I've said before, most of the people who work in corporate media, who go to the [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1189.98s)]
*  White House gala, who are celebrated as journalists don't do any kind of real journalism at all, [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1196.1s)]
*  except the kind that people in the CIA think you should do, which is you call up the CIA, [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1203.1s)]
*  you call up the FBI, you call up the Pentagon and you repeat what they tell you to say. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1207.62s)]
*  People like Natasha Bertrand at Politico and CNN and Kandalinian and NBC News. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1213.1s)]
*  I mean, again, the last people we should want determining who is a real journalist are people [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1218.5s)]
*  who work for the U.S. security state. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1224.18s)]
*  But aside from the fact that Assange has broken more major stories than all of these people [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1226.94s)]
*  combined, which is the metric of what journalism is, Assange has won journalism awards all [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1230.74s)]
*  around the world. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1239.74s)]
*  Here just to give you a few examples, The Guardian in 2011, Julian Assange wins the [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1241.46s)]
*  Martha Gellhorn Journalism Prize. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1246.5s)]
*  Here is the Sydney Morning Herald, the big newspaper in Australia, August of 2019, Julian [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1251.42s)]
*  Assange wins EU Journalism Award and it says WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has been [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1258.78s)]
*  given an award established in honor of an assassinated journalist. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1263.6200000000001s)]
*  Then we move to the next one, which is the International Journalist Network. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1267.42s)]
*  In 2019, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange captures top journalism prize. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1277.42s)]
*  And then here's a graphic, Julian Assange's awards for journalism. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1282.0600000000002s)]
*  He's won many awards for publishing and journalism, including from Amnesty, Time Magazine and [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1285.5800000000002s)]
*  Walkley Awards. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1289.92s)]
*  And it shows the multiple journalism awards that he's won all throughout the years. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1291.26s)]
*  Now, again, it doesn't matter who is not a journalist from the perspective of who can [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1295.9s)]
*  claim the First Amendment protections of fresh freedom. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1303.22s)]
*  Journalists are available to everybody. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1305.66s)]
*  But it's so revealing about how these people see journalism. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1308.46s)]
*  In order to be a journalist to them, you have to work for a large corporation, be completely [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1314.0800000000002s)]
*  controlled by the government and only reveal information that the US government wants you [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1317.22s)]
*  to reveal. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1320.98s)]
*  The minute you're not controlled by the US government, the minute you're actually adversarial [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1321.98s)]
*  to the government, the minute you expose the things they want to keep concealed and don't [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1326.0600000000002s)]
*  want the public to know, that's when you become the enemy because that's what real journalism [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1330.5800000000002s)]
*  is. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1334.46s)]
*  And if there's anyone who deserves the title of real journalist of all these people who [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1336.3s)]
*  talk about journalism constantly, I can't think of anyone more deserving of that title [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1342.06s)]
*  than Julian Assange. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1346.02s)]
*  And he isn't in prison or wasn't in prison for the last 15 years, despite that fact, [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1347.26s)]
*  but precisely because he has engaged in the pure acts of journalism. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1352.58s)]
*  That was the reason why he spent the last 15 years of his life deprived of his freedom. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4cyAtplpQ&t=1357.6200000000001s)]
