# Women's Tennis SCANDAL Elena Rybakina's Abusive Coach Controversy
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [January 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc)
*  Alright, I want to talk to you about a tennis controversy, a controversy that is bubbling [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=0.0s)]
*  through the world of women's professional tennis, which seems like a topic that would [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=11.92s)]
*  be the last thing that I would talk about on this show. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=18.56s)]
*  Now, in part, I do follow tennis very closely. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=21.2s)]
*  I play tennis. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=24.04s)]
*  I've followed tennis for a long time, very closely. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=25.04s)]
*  So in part, I know it's going on for that reason, but I also decided to talk about [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=28.08s)]
*  it not as a tennis controversy, but just because it so illustrates how our discourse and our [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=31.68s)]
*  mentality about men and women and the cultural discourse surrounding them have, I guess you [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=38.72s)]
*  could say evolved, I would say degraded. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=46.68s)]
*  Where so often the people who claim that they believe in the ability of women to be equal, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=49.64s)]
*  to participate fully in our political life and our social life are actually people who [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=54.84s)]
*  see women in a very patronizing way, as see them as very weak and fragile, people who [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=60.480000000000004s)]
*  constantly need to be chivalrously protected and white knighted while they pretend that [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=65.12s)]
*  they are allies of women and sticking up for women. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=73.96000000000001s)]
*  In fact, they're just revealing that they have a view of women as being incapable of [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=77.0s)]
*  their own autonomy or of confronting the same sorts of criticisms or given the same sorts [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=82.0s)]
*  of liberties as anybody else. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=88.0s)]
*  So I just want to tell you this story. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=91.84s)]
*  I'm going to just walk you through it not too long, just a little bit quickly, and then [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=92.84s)]
*  you'll see how bizarre and insane this scandal is, but how reflective it is of modern day [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=96.64s)]
*  mores about how we think of women, especially those people who like to think that they are [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=103.76s)]
*  the ones who protect the little ladies from the things that might hurt them. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=108.88000000000001s)]
*  All of this centers around a tennis player named Elena Rybakina, who is actually Russian. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=114.32000000000001s)]
*  She was born in Russia. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=119.12s)]
*  She grew up in Moscow, but she plays now for Kazakhstan, simply because Kazakhstan offers [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=121.48s)]
*  money to Russian players to play for them, for their country. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=127.4s)]
*  And in 2022, July of 2022, Elena Rybakina won Wimbledon, one of the two most important [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=132.0s)]
*  tennis tournaments along with the US Open. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=140.16s)]
*  She won Wimbledon. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=141.67999999999998s)]
*  She became a top player and continues to this day to be one of the top three or four women's [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=143.39999999999998s)]
*  players. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=147.76s)]
*  And there's a little irony here because 2022, July of 2022, was just a few months after [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=148.76s)]
*  the Russian invasion and the UK decided that all of its sporting events inside the UK would [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=154.04s)]
*  have to ban Russian and Belorussian players. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=160.2s)]
*  And Wimbledon alone actually banned Russian and Belorussian players. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=165.23999999999998s)]
*  And so the person who ended up winning Wimbledon was Elena Rybakina, who in fact is Russian. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=169.51999999999998s)]
*  She just couldn't get included in the band because she technically plays for Kazakhstan. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=173.83999999999997s)]
*  And Princess Catherine had to hand her the trophy to a Russian player, even though the [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=179.72s)]
*  whole point was that those were supposed to be banned. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=184.88s)]
*  So she hadn't asked for a round that win. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=188.52s)]
*  A lot of the best players weren't there because of how pathetic the British are. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=189.68s)]
*  But in any event, she rose to the top of her sport. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=194.20000000000002s)]
*  She won Wimbledon. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=196.4s)]
*  She was 23 at the time that she won. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=198.0s)]
*  So she really did become a top player. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=200.84s)]
*  Now the way she became a top player was that at the age of 17, when she was very unknown, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=203.20000000000002s)]
*  she wasn't really a prodigy. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=209.48000000000002s)]
*  She wasn't really expected to rise to the top of the game. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=212.24s)]
*  She was lingering in the lower ranks of tennis, not even 200 in the world. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=214.48s)]
*  She hired a coach at the age of 17 whose name is Stefano Vukiv, who is from Croatia. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=221.35999999999999s)]
*  And he became her coach over several years. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=227.72s)]
*  And she skyrocketed to the top of the rankings to the point where she was in the top 10 and [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=230.42s)]
*  then won Wimbledon. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=234.01999999999998s)]
*  And usually women's players in particular fire their coaches every six months or a year. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=236.22s)]
*  There's very few that are long lasting relationships. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=240.38s)]
*  But this was her coach for from 20, from the time she was 17 until late last year, many, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=243.06s)]
*  many years. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=249.06s)]
*  It was an extremely successful coach-player relationship obviously. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=250.06s)]
*  And yet for some reason, several people in the world of tennis, coaches, former players, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=255.18s)]
*  commentators, journalists, decided that they didn't like the relationship. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=262.46s)]
*  They didn't like the way in which those two interacted. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=267.38s)]
*  They didn't like in particular the way Elena Rabacca and her coach spoke to her, tried [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=270.86s)]
*  to motivate her. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=275.86s)]
*  They thought it was kind of disrespectful and even abusive. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=276.86s)]
*  One of those former players, Pam Shriver, who is also now an ESPN commentator, she's [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=282.12s)]
*  also a coach, went on to Twitter in January 2023 as she watched Elena Rabacca go to the [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=287.02000000000004s)]
*  finals of the Australian Open, made another final of a major. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=293.5s)]
*  And she just decided to say this on Twitter, quote, as I watched Rabacca try to win her [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=297.06s)]
*  second major in seven months, I hope she finds a coach who speaks and treats her with [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=300.74s)]
*  respect at all times and does not accept anything less. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=305.38s)]
*  Pam Shriver had never talked to Elena Rabacca, no, she had never talked to her coach. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=311.82s)]
*  She knew nothing about it. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=315.3s)]
*  She just decided, I don't like this relationship and I'm going to publicly imply that the coach [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=316.3s)]
*  is abusive. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=319.7s)]
*  And someone on Twitter responded and said, not sure, but it seems that she is quite happy [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=322.3s)]
*  with him despite these antics. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=325.78000000000003s)]
*  And then Shriver responded, happy with not being treated respectfully, not a good life [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=328.32s)]
*  pattern. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=332.92s)]
*  So this created a big controversy that her coach was abusive to her, that he was toxic [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=335.48s)]
*  and disrespectful, that she should fire him, even though she never once even insinuated [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=342.06s)]
*  that she thought that that was the case. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=348.24s)]
*  They all decided for her that she was being treated unfairly, even though she's a very [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=350.03999999999996s)]
*  wealthy tennis player. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=354.84s)]
*  She makes many millions of dollars a year. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=357.24s)]
*  She's surrounded by agents, she has a lot of power. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=359.76s)]
*  And they decided that even though she never complained, this coach should somehow be disciplined [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=362.84000000000003s)]
*  or even fired. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=368.88s)]
*  And as this controversy grew, she actually went onto Instagram and said, after a great [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=370.94s)]
*  Australian Open where she made the final, I have seen some disturbing comments on social [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=376.6s)]
*  media about the behavior of my coach, Stefano Vukov. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=380.40000000000003s)]
*  I want to clarify any misinterpretations. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=383.84s)]
*  Stefano has believed in me for many years before anyone else did. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=386.32s)]
*  We plotted a strategy together and how I could achieve great things and his method shows [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=390.2s)]
*  in my Graham Slam success so far. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=394.26s)]
*  He is a passionate coach with a lot of knowledge about tennis, unlike people that are making [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=396.96s)]
*  these comments. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=401.0s)]
*  He has great knowledge about me as a person and as an athlete. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=402.8s)]
*  Those who know me well will know that I would never accept a coach that didn't respect me [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=405.88s)]
*  and all our hard work. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=410.03999999999996s)]
*  I may be quiet on court and in general, but inside me is a competitive athlete that wants [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=412.0s)]
*  to achieve great things and Stefano has helped me greatly in this way. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=416.56s)]
*  So please disregard any fake news to the contrary. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=420.24s)]
*  And she's talked about this often, that he's a very vocal, animated coach and she is very [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=425.12s)]
*  stoic. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=429.76s)]
*  When she went wumbled in, she barely expressed any emotion. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=430.76s)]
*  She's just very quiet and internal, kind of closed. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=432.36s)]
*  And so they make a good team according to her. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=436.15999999999997s)]
*  And yet people just didn't stop, even when she kept defending him and saying, no, this [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=439.8s)]
*  is a very healthy relationship. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=443.56s)]
*  It's helped me a lot. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=444.56s)]
*  She's never once even implied that she was being treated unfairly. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=445.92s)]
*  All these people in tennis and in media kept saying, this is really toxic. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=451.5s)]
*  This relationship is terrible. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=457.6s)]
*  She's being abused. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=459.1s)]
*  Remember, this is not a 15 year old girl. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=460.1s)]
*  She was 22 when she went wumbled and she's now 25, 25 years old. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=462.92s)]
*  At the end of last year, she briefly announced that he would no longer be part of her team [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=469.52s)]
*  and there was a lot of gossip that the reason was that he had been suspended from being [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=474.59999999999997s)]
*  allowed to be a coach by the Women's Tennis Association, but it was all kind of gossipy. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=479.47999999999996s)]
*  But then at the end of last year, at the beginning of this year, she announced that he was coming [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=484.53999999999996s)]
*  back and would be her coach again and would travel with her to Australia where they are [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=489.0s)]

*  from coaching because he treats her improperly, disrespectfully, abusively, that their relationship [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=627.5200000000001s)]

*  I'm excited to announce that Stefano will be joining the team for the 2025 season. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=667.9599999999999s)]

*  And then in response, Pam Schreiber announced on Twitter, quote, it's time for our entire [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=674.9599999999999s)]
*  sport to finally stand up to known abuse and cult-like manipulations of players. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=678.52s)]
*  This is a very sad situation and my prayers are with Elena Robacona. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=684.4s)]
*  My prayers are with her. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=688.56s)]
*  For a couple of years from 2020 until about 2023, the Women's Tennis Association innovated [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=692.52s)]
*  this new feature where coaches were allowed to go onto the court on changeovers when they [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=699.36s)]
*  change sides and give coaching to the player and in exchange, they would have to wear microphones [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=704.92s)]
*  so that the audience could hear. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=712.24s)]
*  So the audience is getting a sort of glimpse into the player-coach relationship, how they [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=713.24s)]
*  admit match, make adjustments or analysis of strategies. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=716.84s)]
*  And that was where a lot of people started deciding it was the middle of a match, very [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=720.82s)]
*  intense match, high level match, and he would go onto court. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=724.22s)]
*  He had about 90 seconds to try and tell her what she was doing wrong, what she needed [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=727.1s)]
*  to do more of. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=731.0600000000001s)]
*  And this is when people decided that they didn't like how he talked to her. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=732.0600000000001s)]
*  So here's just a little bit of a glimpse, some of the clips that caused all of that [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=736.34s)]
*  anger. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=739.7800000000001s)]
*  Because I know you feel comfortable in this moment there, I get it. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=740.7800000000001s)]
*  But you see the down line, go for it. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=743.7800000000001s)]
*  You understand? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=744.7800000000001s)]
*  Go for it in this moment. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=745.7800000000001s)]
*  You have many times that the ball is, you're too much stuck on this ball. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=746.7800000000001s)]
*  You have many times that the ball is, you're too much stuck on this ball. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=747.7800000000001s)]
*  You have many times that the ball is, you're too much stuck on this ball. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=748.7800000000001s)]
*  You have many times that the ball is, you're too much stuck on this side and you want to [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=749.78s)]
*  repeat some angle that you don't have any space. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=750.78s)]
*  You understand? [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=751.78s)]
*  So when the ball is short, attack the forehand, go forward. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=752.78s)]
*  You understand? [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=753.78s)]
*  It's perfect because you see that at the end of the day. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=754.78s)]
*  He's missing from that side. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=755.78s)]
*  And the backhand is making one million balls. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=756.78s)]
*  And either you play like really, you have to overheat four, five, six balls to get [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=757.78s)]
*  the point from that side. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=758.78s)]
*  And we've been playing a little bit too much to the backhand side. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=759.78s)]
*  A little bit too much. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=760.78s)]
*  Okay? [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=761.78s)]
*  It's fine when you feel it play a big target. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=762.78s)]
*  Play on the forehand. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=763.78s)]
*  But hello. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=764.78s)]
*  When the ball is short, you don't need to overheat it because sometimes the ball is [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=765.78s)]
*  short and you're swinging so big. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=783.18s)]
*  Okay? [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=785.6999999999999s)]
*  And then you're missing by this much or a little bit longer. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=786.6999999999999s)]
*  You go off the rhythm. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=789.3s)]
*  Make yourself space when she's spinning the ball. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=791.14s)]
*  When the ball is coming to you, okay. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=793.14s)]
*  Hold the rhythm. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=794.74s)]
*  But when you see this kind of ball, give yourself a little bit of space. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=796.7s)]
*  It's very difficult to play off the bounce with these balls. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=799.7s)]
*  Come on. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=800.7s)]
*  Let's go this game. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=801.7s)]
*  What is it? [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=802.7s)]
*  Trying to find the rhythm takes some time. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=803.7s)]
*  We were indoors for some weeks. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=806.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=807.7s)]
*  So of course. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=808.7s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=809.7s)]
*  I don't want you to slap the balls. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=810.7s)]
*  I want you to put pressure on the forehand side to be ready. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=811.7s)]
*  When the balls are a little bit short, approach them. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=816.7s)]
*  And don't hit them like wait and then stay in the same spot. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=818.7s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=822.7s)]
*  But remember, you have to be ready. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=823.7s)]
*  Remember, the slower the hand, yeah, the slower the hand, the worse the idea. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=825.6600000000001s)]
*  You understand what I mean? [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=828.6600000000001s)]
*  A little bit wider with the legs, a little bit down. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=829.6600000000001s)]
*  Extend the hand more forward because when you try to do a little bit more spin, your [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=832.6600000000001s)]
*  follow-through is becoming a little bit too short. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=836.6600000000001s)]
*  So, okay, extend into the shot. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=838.6600000000001s)]
*  All right. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=839.6600000000001s)]
*  So that's some of that. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=840.6600000000001s)]
*  And then here's a little bit more. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=841.6600000000001s)]
*  See, I know nothing. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=842.6600000000001s)]
*  Seeing I see you, but I know you better. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=843.6600000000001s)]

*  We need to right now, everything. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=854.62s)]
*  Listen. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=856.62s)]
*  Don't talk, Jesus Christ. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=857.62s)]
*  Every time you want to complain about something. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=858.62s)]
*  My God. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=860.62s)]
*  Listen. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=861.62s)]
*  Everything is okay. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=862.62s)]
*  You're playing good. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=863.62s)]
*  As a manager, energy a little bit better. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=864.62s)]
*  So that's the big offense when he says, listen to me. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=867.62s)]
*  Don't talk, Jesus Christ. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=871.62s)]
*  You're always wanting to talk. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=872.62s)]
*  You're always complaining. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=873.62s)]
*  And she was laughing. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=874.62s)]
*  They obviously have a very close relationship. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=875.62s)]
*  That's how he motivates her. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=877.62s)]
*  This is the relationship that they have, the dynamic that she wants that has worked very [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=878.62s)]
*  well for her. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=881.62s)]
*  And so people looked at all these things and said, this is wrong. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=884.58s)]
*  She may not think it's wrong, but it's really wrong. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=887.58s)]
*  We can't allow this to happen. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=891.58s)]
*  And so they created such a narrative, such a defamation attack on him that he was some [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=893.58s)]
*  kind of an abuser, that he was psychologically manipulating her, that he actually got suspended. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=900.58s)]
*  And once he got suspended and the WTA said, this can't be your coach. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=905.58s)]
*  We're not going to allow him onto the stadium. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=910.58s)]
*  We're not going to allow him onto the facilities pending an investigation. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=913.5400000000001s)]
*  She gave interviews where she repeatedly defended him and expressed an outrage that her autonomy [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=915.5400000000001s)]
*  and her judgment were being overridden by other people. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=920.5400000000001s)]
*  Here is an interview she gave on January 4th of this year. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=923.5400000000001s)]
*  Well, I'm working with Goran. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=930.5400000000001s)]
*  And these articles came out. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=932.5400000000001s)]
*  I mean, I can only say, and I said it already before, that he never mistreated me or it [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=935.5400000000001s)]
*  was never anything like that. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=941.5s)]
*  And I mean, I'm working with Goran. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=942.5s)]
*  I'm happy the way we work now for the couple of weeks. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=945.5s)]
*  And as I also said that Stefano is joining my team, rejoining the team, because I know [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=949.5s)]
*  the person for six years and there is a lot of things we can do outside of the court too. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=955.5s)]
*  And of course, I'm not really happy with the situation. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=960.5s)]
*  I'm not happy with the comments which I see, especially from the people who are on the [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=965.5s)]
*  tour. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=970.46s)]
*  It's active coaches, commentators. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=971.46s)]
*  I don't think that it's fair. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=973.46s)]
*  And yeah, but the only thing I can say is like he never mistreated me. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=976.46s)]
*  I have respect to him for everything he did from the very beginning when I was 200, all [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=983.46s)]
*  the way what we did. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=989.46s)]
*  I don't know, you can name me other coaches who had the same success with players who [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=992.46s)]
*  have been 200 and then winning Grand Slam and being in the top. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=998.4200000000001s)]
*  So no matter how much you keep saying, this is the coach that I want, he never mistreated [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1003.4200000000001s)]
*  me, the way he coaches me is what I need and what I want. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1007.4200000000001s)]
*  All these people continue to say that she's somehow a victim and just doesn't realize [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1010.4200000000001s)]
*  it and they know better even though they don't know her and never met her. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1015.4200000000001s)]
*  So she went to the Australian Open this week and she gave an interview prior to the tournament [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1018.4200000000001s)]
*  beginning and she was asked about this and she again had to just emphatically say that [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1026.22s)]
*  these people have no idea what they're talking about. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1033.22s)]
*  Can you talk us through the situation with Stefano and what capacity you'd like him, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1036.22s)]
*  what role he's going to be playing on your team, what you'd like him to be doing on your [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1045.38s)]
*  team and how much you've been told about what he'll be able to do moving forward? [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1048.78s)]
*  Well first of all, with the whole situation I don't want to speak much about what's going [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1055.54s)]
*  to be next but definitely as I said before I don't agree with a lot of things what WTA [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1059.98s)]
*  do in the sense of my relationship with Stefano as I said before that I have never made any [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1065.98s)]
*  complaints or any of these things and I always said that he never mistreated me so that's [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1074.82s)]
*  one thing and since the situation how it is now I don't really want to speak about this [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1082.6599999999999s)]
*  more and I want to focus on my matches here. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1089.82s)]
*  So she said I don't want to speak about this more, my coach never mistreated me, he's being [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1092.34s)]
*  unfairly accused and of course they kept asking about it and then here's a little bit more [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1096.7s)]
*  of what she said. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1099.6599999999999s)]
*  Okay Ben and Courtney, Ben? [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1100.7s)]
*  I just wanted to ask you were mentioning not being happy with the comments that other coaches [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1102.74s)]
*  and commentators were making, do you understand why they're making these comments or why they're [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1106.26s)]
*  concerned about the situation? [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1111.1s)]
*  Well I get that one of the coaches, Pam Sugar, I don't know her personally, she never came [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1112.7s)]
*  to me, she never talked with me but I know her story, it's sad but it doesn't mean that [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1119.02s)]
*  other players are facing the same issues and since she doesn't know me I don't know her [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1124.1399999999999s)]
*  I don't think it's fair to make any comments like that especially being an active coach [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1129.1799999999998s)]
*  and being a commentator, journalist and so on. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1133.94s)]
*  Courtney? [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1137.58s)]
*  So she's talking about one of the main accusers who never even came and talked to her, doesn't [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1138.6599999999999s)]
*  know her. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1142.9399999999998s)]
*  This accuser Pam Schiver had a coach for her entire adult, for her entire life starting [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1144.22s)]
*  when she was 15 until she was 30, her whole playing career and she waited until he was [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1150.46s)]
*  82 years old and he died and afterwards she accused him of having sexually assaulted her [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1155.46s)]
*  from when she was 15 and then she thought she was in love with him, she stayed in a [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1163.06s)]
*  romantic relationship with him even though he was married all the way until he was 30 [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1167.58s)]
*  and I guess she thinks that because it happened to her it's happened to everybody else but [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1172.6999999999998s)]
*  no matter how many times this tennis player, Linda Robachan, keeps saying I'm not a victim, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1177.06s)]
*  people should stop trying to protect me from things I don't need protection from, they [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1181.22s)]
*  just can't stop because they really believe that she is incapable of deciding for herself [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1185.58s)]
*  and needing protection and the reason why I bring this all up is because it's so obvious [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1191.62s)]
*  that if this were a male player and the coach was speaking to her, not just in the way that [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1196.18s)]
*  he speaks to her but in a much more aggressive way which is very common in sports, nobody [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1201.8600000000001s)]
*  would be saying anything, these people who think that they're such allies of women, that [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1206.22s)]
*  they're such feminists, that they're standing up for women against abusive men are doing [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1209.42s)]
*  so simply because they think that only men can be spoken to that way and not women, that [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1216.06s)]
*  women are too fragile and can't handle it. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1219.82s)]
*  Has anyone watched an NFL game, a football game and seen how coaches and players scream [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1221.7s)]
*  insane vulgarities at each other, threatening each other with physical abuse in the heat [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1228.54s)]
*  of the game and nobody ever says oh this coach is acting abusively and inappropriately and [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1233.18s)]
*  disrespectfully and this is a toxic relationship, just take a little bit, this is just some [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1238.98s)]
*  random montage of a few clips that happens all the time. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1243.04s)]
*  A minute or two later, he comes back over to the sideline, Brian Dayball, one of the [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1251.7s)]
*  coach of the year candidates going into the second half. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1257.14s)]
*  On Russell Williams, Wilson, Quincy Williams on Wilson. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1259.74s)]
*  Possession there and I'll tell you when Dallas' defense came over to the sideline, they were [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1264.5s)]
*  gassed and Chris Rashard just getting in the faces of his linebackers urging them. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1268.54s)]
*  In week four and we have a marker down on the field and Wissenhut is hot. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1273.18s)]
*  Who do you think that's on? [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1279.22s)]
*  I think that's on Malpia. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1282.7s)]
*  He's confused, right? [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1287.7s)]
*  But look at this, Tom Brady and Bill O'Brien, his offensive coordinator, filling the blanks. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1300.7s)]
*  That is a heated conversation. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1312.7s)]
*  See Josh is like, you had the end cut, he was open. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1315.7s)]
*  Tom's like, you know what, I know he was open. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1319.7s)]
*  You know what, I know he was open, I know it. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1322.7s)]
*  Just Tom, I just. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1326.7s)]
*  I mean that's what you see all the time and you can just apply this and the reason why [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1327.7s)]
*  I wanted to talk about this other than the fact that I do think it's interesting unto [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1332.7s)]
*  itself is because you see this happening all the time. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1335.7s)]
*  You criticize some high level government official or some influential media figure and it's [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1338.7s)]
*  a woman, a lot of people will come and say you're generating violence and harassment [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1344.7s)]
*  toward women as though women can't be criticized in the same way as men. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1351.7s)]
*  Or a lot of times when women say I don't feel victimized, this is not a concern to me, a [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1355.7s)]
*  lot of other people will come and say oh she just doesn't know, she's been acclimated to [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1361.7s)]
*  accept abuse without even realizing that it's abuse. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1365.7s)]
*  Imagine just the audacity of overriding some other adult's judgment about what's best for [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1369.7s)]
*  their own life, about what kind of relationship they find fulfilling and they find productive. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1374.7s)]
*  And so much of this is based on like so much identity politics. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1379.7s)]
*  This condescension toward women or to minority groups, it's the same exact dynamic. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1383.7s)]
*  This sort of patronizing attitude that people in these minority groups or women are too [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1390.7s)]
*  fragile and too weak to be treated in the same way as other people and it really is this sort [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1395.7s)]
*  of sexism or bigotry or just kind of lack of faith in other people that masquerades as [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1400.7s)]
*  enlightenment and liberal chivalry and protection. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1408.7s)]
*  And that's why I found this tennis scandal so interesting because it's a particularly [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1412.7s)]
*  extreme version where this woman is saying and you saw her and you hear her over and [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1417.7s)]
*  over, none of this ever happened. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1421.7s)]
*  These people who are saying this have no idea what they're talking about. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1423.7s)]
*  I want him to continue as my coach. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1426.7s)]
*  It's been a very fruitful relationship and even though they pretend that they're allies [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1428.7s)]
*  of women, the reality is that they don't really believe that adult women are capable of [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1432.7s)]
*  making their own decisions, of enduring the same sorts of criticism, even a tiny fraction [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1436.7s)]
*  of what those male football players endure that nobody would ever think to comment on it. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1442.7s)]
*  So it is a really interesting scandal. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1446.7s)]
*  It seems like it doesn't have a resolution that they're going to continue to keep this [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1448.7s)]
*  coach banned, notwithstanding the fact that there's no victim, there's no complaining [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1452.7s)]
*  victim because other people have decided that this little lady needs protection and they [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1455.7s)]
*  know better for her life than she knows what is best for her. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1460.7s)]
*  Did you resolve to get healthier this year as part of your New Year's resolution in 2025? [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1465.7s)]
*  If you did, great. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1469.7s)]
*  If you didn't, you should think about it. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1471.7s)]
*  So then the question is, how are you going to do it with supplements? [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1473.7s)]
*  Okay, that's good. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1476.7s)]
*  Some green fruit and vegetable drink. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1478.7s)]
*  Fine. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1480.7s)]
*  But then ask yourself, do any of these promise better health? [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1481.7s)]
*  They do not. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1483.7s)]
*  What's the point of green drinks and health supplements? [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1485.7s)]
*  If you aren't 100% healthy, you can't do it. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1487.7s)]
*  You can't do it. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1489.7s)]
*  You can't do it. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1491.7s)]
*  So, what do you do with those green food and health supplements if you aren't 100% confident [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1493.7s)]
*  that they'll improve your health? [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1496.7s)]
*  The Field of Greens better health promise makes it radically different. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N82_zLDnRgc&t=1498.7s)]
