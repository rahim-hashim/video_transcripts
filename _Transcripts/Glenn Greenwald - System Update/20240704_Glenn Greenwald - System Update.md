# Dem Oligarchs Forcing Biden Out of Presidential Race
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [July 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU)
*  There are all sorts of very fascinating dynamics that have emerged with the, I would say, close [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=0.0s)]
*  to unprecedented attempt to force Joe Biden, the current sitting elected president, out [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=13.52s)]
*  of a election that he obviously wants to run in, that he was named the Democratic nominee for, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=21.36s)]
*  and one that he has no intention of leaving. And yet there is a concerted effort on the part of [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=32.16s)]
*  the media that had long protected Joe Biden, but that is so desperate to do anything to [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=38.72s)]
*  ensure Donald Trump doesn't win, but also the kind of 500 or a thousand people that really run the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=44.16s)]
*  Democratic Party, the very large funders, the oligarchs that fund the Democratic Party, and [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=50.56s)]
*  both of them are in a concerted effort to force Joe Biden out of a race that whatever you think [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=56.400000000000006s)]
*  of Joe Biden, he is the president and wants to remain in. And that obviously raises all kinds [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=61.760000000000005s)]
*  of interesting questions about what type of democracy the United States is. We're constantly [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=66.80000000000001s)]
*  hearing from the Democratic Party that they and they alone can protect and preserve American [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=71.12s)]
*  democracy. And this raises a lot of questions. Now, one of the questions before we get to that [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=75.76s)]
*  is that we have long heard over the last several weeks from Biden defenders that the reason it's [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=82.08000000000001s)]
*  so inappropriate to force Joe Biden out of office is because the Democratic Party voters, their [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=88.64s)]
*  sacred voters who have the power in our system of government to make decisions, were given a wide [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=96.0s)]
*  choice and they decided that they wanted Joe Biden to be their presidential nominee in 2024, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=102.4s)]
*  and it's therefore inappropriate to try and deny them those that wish. Now, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=108.08000000000001s)]
*  the reality is that as the Democratic Party claims that it is the only believer in or [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=116.32000000000001s)]
*  protector of American democratic values, the Democratic Party for years now has been acting [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=122.72s)]
*  in an extremely repressive anti-democratic way, especially when it comes to choosing [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=129.92s)]
*  who the nominee for the presidency that party will have. That's been the case in 2016 and in [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=135.67999999999998s)]
*  2020, but also in 2024. The idea that Democratic voters were given a free choice and decided that [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=142.79999999999998s)]
*  they were going to vote for Joe Biden as the nominee that they wanted is an absolute joke. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=149.27999999999997s)]
*  The Democratic Party, more than a year ago, was clear and explicit [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=154.16s)]
*  that they were not going to allow any primary challenges to Joe Biden, that even if there were [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=160.96s)]
*  primary challengers, and there were like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Marianne Williamson and others, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=165.76s)]
*  they would not allow any debates, they would not give those candidates any chance to even [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=172.64s)]
*  get on ballots, and that they had declared before any vote was cast that no matter what, the [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=179.12s)]
*  presidential nominee of the Democratic Party would be Joe Biden. Now, that stands in stark contrast [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=185.84s)]
*  to what the Republican Party did. You'll probably recall that a lot of different [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=192.56s)]
*  well-known and established and popular and very well-funded politicians like current [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=196.64s)]
*  Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley and Tim Scott and former Vice President Mike [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=202.4s)]
*  Pence ran for the Republican nomination. They were given the opportunity to appear on screen [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=207.92000000000002s)]
*  and in debates, and people voted for Donald Trump. He was the actual choice of the Republican Party [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=213.20000000000002s)]
*  to be the nominee. The Democratic Party did the opposite. They foreclosed any possibility [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=218.24s)]
*  of having a Democratic vote. Here was Simone Sanders, who worked both for the Biden White House [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=225.12s)]
*  and also for Kamala Harris, and then like so many of them, like Jen Psaki, she left to do the same [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=232.56s)]
*  thing at MSNBC. She's an official Democratic Party spokeswoman, but for MSNBC, she went on [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=237.76000000000002s)]
*  Mourning Joe in May of 2023, and this is what she announced about the upcoming Democratic [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=243.28s)]
*  primary to determine who will be the nominee for 2024. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=250.96s)]
*  Bobby Kennedy Jr. doing well. He's at 19%. Hasn't really gotten that much out there. I mean, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=253.68s)]
*  it's starting to hear more and more talk about him. Are we going to actually have a challenge here? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=265.28000000000003s)]
*  I'm trying not to laugh, Joe. There's not going to be. Can I stop you for a second? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=271.52s)]
*  Do you know how many people said the same thing about Donald Trump in 2015 on this show? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=277.2s)]
*  Except I will note. The same exact thing. Yes, because there was going to be a Republican [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=283.04s)]
*  primary, but I really think that the mealy-mouthed Democrats, as I like to call them, and some of my [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=288.0s)]
*  progressive friends. Okay, so first of all, she's saying that Joe Scarborough tried to say, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=294.32s)]
*  you're laughing at the idea that anybody might be able to win over Joe Biden, and then Joe Scarborough [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=302.72s)]
*  said, well, people were saying the same thing in 2016 about Donald Trump. They were scoffing at [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=308.96s)]
*  the idea that he might win. She said, yeah, but the difference is the Republican party actually [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=314.23999999999995s)]
*  allowed a primary in 2016, so anybody might win, whoever the voters choose. In contrast, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=319.28s)]
*  we're the Democratic party, and we are not going to have a primary. We're not going to allow anyone [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=326.15999999999997s)]
*  to challenge Joe Biden, and that's why I'm saying I know for certain Biden will win, because there's [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=330.0s)]
*  not going to be any kind of free and fair election. There's not going to be an election at all. Listen [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=335.12s)]
*  to what she says. And who would like to live in a fantasy land? They need to come back to reality, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=338.4s)]
*  and the reality is this. The sitting president of the United States of America is a Democrat, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=346.71999999999997s)]
*  a Democrat that would like to run for reelection, so much so that he has declared a reelection [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=351.03999999999996s)]
*  campaign. In that case, the Democratic National Committee will not facilitate a primary process. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=355.84s)]
*  There will be no debate stage for Bobby Kennedy, Marianne Williamson, or anyone else. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=361.28s)]
*  We're going to have another Bobby Kennedy in an empty chair in the debate, right? There will be no [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=366.4s)]
*  debate. Yeah, no debate. The Democratic National Committee administers the debates, and they're [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=370.96s)]
*  not going to set up a primary process for debates for someone to challenge the head of the Democratic [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=375.12s)]
*  party. I mean, one more. Do you hear what she said? She said the Democratic party, the DNC, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=380.96s)]
*  will not facilitate a primary election. There will be nobody permitted to challenge Joe Biden. We will [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=388.0s)]
*  not have any presidential debates. The Democratic party won't allow them, and we are telling you [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=394.8s)]
*  right now before a single vote is cast that the nominee of our party will be Joe Biden. Not because [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=400.8s)]
*  I'm predicting that based on what the voters might do, but that we're not going to give the voters any [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=407.04s)]
*  opportunity to actually choose. There's no choice, she said. And that's exactly what the Democratic [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=412.96000000000004s)]
*  party proceeded to do. In fact, there was in some states not even a Democratic party ballot. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=419.12s)]
*  So this idea that, oh, it would be contrary to democracy to force Joe Biden out of the race [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=426.4s)]
*  because he was the nominee chosen by the base of the voters of the Democratic party is a complete [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=432.72s)]
*  joke. I heard Jen Psaki saying that. I heard Joe Scarborough saying that. So many of them have said [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=438.56s)]
*  that. David Axelrod said it. It's the exact opposite of reality. Now, obviously, this is [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=444.8s)]
*  not the first time that the Democratic party, the saviors of American democracy, have acted [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=450.56s)]
*  anti-democratically, as we know, in 2016. The DNC cheated in every conceivable way possible to ensure [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=454.96000000000004s)]
*  that Bernie Sanders could not possibly win the nomination over Hillary Clinton, even if he got [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=462.72s)]
*  the most votes. And you don't need to believe, to listen to me, to believe that happened. Here is a [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=468.24s)]
*  stalwart Democratic party loyalist named Senator Elizabeth Warren who went on PBS in November of [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=474.32s)]
*  2017 and said this. We're learning today that a new book that is coming out by Donna Brazile, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=481.12s)]
*  the former acting chair of the Democratic National Committee, that the campaign of [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=488.64s)]
*  Secretary Hillary Clinton was far more influential at the Democratic party, the Democratic National [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=492.88s)]
*  Committee than we previously knew. Do you think, though, that what we're learning from Donna [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=498.96s)]
*  Brazile's book suggests that the campaign, that what the Democratic National Committee did [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=503.28s)]
*  meant this election was rigged? Yeah, I think it was. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=507.68s)]
*  It's a pretty powerful charge. Well, what we have to focus on now as Democrats is we recognize the [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=512.24s)]
*  process was rigged and now it is up to Democrats to build a new process, a process that really [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=519.84s)]
*  works and works for everyone. Now, isn't it amazing, by the way, how if Republicans say [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=528.96s)]
*  that they think the 2020 election was rigged, that's considered almost illegal. It's called [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=537.6800000000001s)]
*  election denialism, whatever. But Elizabeth Warren came right out and said, and so did Donna Brazile, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=547.52s)]
*  who ran Al Gore's campaign, was the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=555.12s)]
*  that the Democratic party rigged the election in 2016 to ensure that Hillary Clinton won [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=559.4399999999999s)]
*  and that voters had no choice. Here is another thing the Democrats did from Politico in October [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=564.8s)]
*  of 2016. Donna Brazile is under siege after giving Clinton debate questions. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=572.48s)]
*  As you might know, Donna Brazile was a CNN commentator at the time. CNN was hosting a [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=581.28s)]
*  debate between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton and she got exposed for having passed [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=586.48s)]
*  debate questions that CNN prepared and intended to ask only to Hillary Clinton but not to Bernie [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=593.84s)]
*  Sanders. And here's how it got exposed, quote, after hacked emails published Monday by WikiLeaks [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=598.4s)]
*  appeared to reveal that Donna Brazile during her time as a CNN commentator gave advance notice to [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=606.0799999999999s)]
*  Clinton's camp about a debate question, Brazile has lost a CNN contract, which had been suspended [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=610.64s)]
*  since Brazile took over the DNC in July and found herself used as fodder for one of Donald Trump's [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=616.16s)]
*  favorite talking points. That in this quote rigged election, the DNC has been in the bag for Clinton [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=621.52s)]
*  since the beginning. Isn't it amazing though, I go this is a Donald Trump talking point when we [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=627.6s)]
*  just heard Elizabeth Warren say exactly the same thing? And by the way, is it any wonder why the [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=632.16s)]
*  Democrats wanted so badly Julian Assange to rot in prison given how much corruption he exposed on [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=638.16s)]
*  the part of the Democratic Party and the Hillary Clinton campaign, including what Donna Brazile did? [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=644.0s)]
*  And just to remind you, here from The Guardian in July of 2016, quote, Debbie Wasserman Schultz [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=649.84s)]
*  to resign as DNC chair as email scandal rocks the Democrats. Quote, Schultz said she would step down [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=654.56s)]
*  after the convention. She has been forced to step aside after a leak of DNC emails showed officials [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=663.04s)]
*  actively favoring Hillary Clinton during the presidential primary and plotting against Clinton's [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=669.76s)]
*  rival, Bernie Sanders. They rigged the election in 2016. They cheated constantly. They denied voters [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=674.3199999999999s)]
*  the opportunity for a free and fair election just like they did in 2024, as we just heard from [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=682.24s)]
*  Simone Sanders. And they would have gotten away with it. People would have suspected it, but [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=687.44s)]
*  couldn't prove it unless and until WikiLeaks published the truth about what the Democratic [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=691.92s)]
*  Party did in the emails that they published, which is of course why Democrats to this very day [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=697.92s)]
*  despise Julian Assange and want him in prison. Not because they think he endangered national security, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=702.5600000000001s)]
*  but because they think that he helped elect Donald Trump in 2016 by exposing true, authentic, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=706.72s)]
*  and genuine corruption on the part of the Clinton wing of the Democratic Party. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=714.1600000000001s)]
*  This is the party constantly claiming they're the only ones who believe in the values of democracy. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=718.4s)]
*  They cheated in 2016. Their top officials had to resign. They got caught passing questions [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=723.0400000000001s)]
*  of the Clinton campaign and rigging the entire thing. 2024, they just said, we're not having an [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=727.36s)]
*  election at all. And then in 2020, as you might remember, Bernie Sanders won the first three [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=733.2800000000001s)]
*  primaries, including in Nevada, where he had a gigantic victory. He looked well on the way [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=741.36s)]
*  to winning the nomination until Barack Obama intervened and basically made deals with and [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=746.88s)]
*  threatened and cajoled every candidate who might divide the vote with Joe Biden to drop out of the [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=752.5600000000001s)]
*  race. The only one they allowed to stay in was Elizabeth Warren because they knew she would take [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=758.08s)]
*  votes away from Bernie Sanders, which would help Biden. And rather than a free or fair election, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=763.2s)]
*  it was one that was completely shaped and controlled by the intervention in secret of [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=768.08s)]
*  Barack Obama. Here from the New York Times in April of 2020, quote, accelerate the endgame, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=772.4000000000001s)]
*  Obama's role in wrapping up the primary, quote, with calibrated stealth, Mr. Obama has been [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=777.76s)]
*  considerably more engaged in the campaign's denouement than has been previously revealed. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=784.32s)]
*  Even before he endorsed Mr. Biden on Tuesday for months, Mr. Obama had kept in close contact with [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=789.2800000000001s)]
*  senior party officials in hopes of preventing a repeat of the protracted and nasty 2016 presidential [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=797.36s)]
*  race. Then in the weeks after it became clear that Mr. Biden was the party's near-certain nominee, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=804.08s)]
*  Mr. Obama telling a friend he, quote, needed to accelerate the endgame had at least four [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=809.84s)]
*  conversations, long conversations, with his former vice president's remaining rival, Senator Bernie [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=815.6800000000001s)]
*  Sanders. Mr. Obama's efforts to ease the senator out of the race played a significant role in Mr. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=822.5600000000001s)]
*  Sanders' decision to end his bid and endorse Mr. Biden. According to people close to the Vermont [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=827.84s)]
*  Independent, Mr. Obama did not directly encourage Mr. Sanders' rivals to endorse Biden ahead of the [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=832.88s)]
*  decisive Super Tuesday primaries, but he did tell Pete Buttigieg, a moderate, that he would [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=838.16s)]
*  never have more leverage than on the day that he was quitting the race. And the former South Bend [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=844.0s)]
*  mayor soon joined the avalanche of former candidates backing Mr. Biden. Meaning, look, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=849.52s)]
*  if you drop out now, Pete, and help Joe Biden, you have a lot of leverage right now. Biden got the [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=855.68s)]
*  nomination because Buttigieg dropped out at Obama's urging. The minute Biden wins, he names Pete [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=862.72s)]
*  Buttigieg, whose only experience was becoming mayor of South Bend, Indiana, with 8,000 votes. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=869.84s)]
*  He puts him in charge of the Department of Transportation, an area in which, obviously, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=877.52s)]
*  Pete Buttigieg has no experience and was completely unqualified to run because of that quid pro quo. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=884.4s)]
*  Here from Fox 35 in Orlando in March of this year, quote, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=889.68s)]
*  why Florida Democrats will not even vote in the presidential preference primary. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=893.12s)]
*  Quote, if you are registered with the Democratic Party, you will not receive a ballot in this PPP. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=898.16s)]
*  Since the Florida Democratic Party nominated Joe Biden as their sole candidate, there is no ballot [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=902.4s)]
*  for registered voters, voters registered with the Democratic Party. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=907.8399999999999s)]
*  So there's your party that saves American democracy, that is safeguarding the values of democracy. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=911.28s)]
*  It is the very opposite of what democracy is. And while I want to be the last person to ever defend [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=920.0799999999999s)]
*  Joe Biden in any way, I do think it's worth noting, just to close this up, that there is something a [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=927.4399999999999s)]
*  little bit odd from a perspective of what democracy is, that we have an elected president [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=937.12s)]
*  who, according to the Democratic Party, won the nomination. He is the Democratic Party nominee [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=944.56s)]
*  for president. And now, because a lot of people, very powerful and influential people, are frightened [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=949.4399999999999s)]
*  that Biden is going to lose to Donald Trump, they are now organizing in secret, using their power [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=957.76s)]
*  to force the elected president out of the White House and out of the race. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=963.76s)]
*  Kind of smells like a little bit of a coup in some sense. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=968.48s)]
*  And it doesn't matter what Democratic Party voters want in polls. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=973.6800000000001s)]
*  It doesn't even really matter what the media is saying, because what they're saying is what [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=978.8000000000001s)]
*  they're told to say. The reality of American democracy is that there are about 500 to 1,000 [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=982.08s)]
*  people who actually control what they're saying. And that's because of the fact that [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=988.32s)]
*  they control both parties. The billionaires and the mega donors who facilitate the campaign. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=992.64s)]
*  And those are the people who are really making the decisions about who will be the [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1002.08s)]
*  nominee for president. Here's the New York Times on July 1st, quote, the road to a crisis, how [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1007.1999999999999s)]
*  Democrats let Biden guide to renomination. Quote, an 81-year-old candidate and no Plan B. Quote, [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1013.12s)]
*  how did we get here, one leading Democrat asks. The answer is complicated. Many party leaders, [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1019.84s)]
*  donors, activists and ordinary voters stunned by the president's faltering debate appearance [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1025.52s)]
*  now fear he will lose to former President Trump and drag Democrats to devastating [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1030.64s)]
*  defeats in congressional and state elections. Mr. Biden is surrounded by a tight circle of [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1034.72s)]
*  longtime aides and family members who have encouraged his desire to seek a second term. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1040.08s)]
*  At key moments, those who tried to sound the alarm about Mr. Biden's potential weaknesses, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1044.88s)]
*  among them David Axelrod, Mr. Obama's chief strategist and James Carville, who helped elect [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1049.52s)]
*  Bill Clinton in 1992, were slapped down by Democrats, often in the brutal discord of [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1054.96s)]
*  social media sites like X and chastised by top Biden aides for being disloyal. Quote, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1059.68s)]
*  I said then privately and publicly if Biden ran, he would be the nominee, Mr. Axelrod said. I felt [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1065.84s)]
*  a primary challenge would fail and only help Trump. I'm sure there were potential Democratic [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1073.2s)]
*  challengers who made the same calculation and didn't want to jeopardize their future by running [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1077.92s)]
*  and taking that risk. But now here's what's really going on from the New York Times two days later, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1082.56s)]
*  July 3rd. Quote, big donors turn on Biden quietly. Some of the president's past supporters want a new [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1088.48s)]
*  candidate, but they are leery of going public. Quote, as of late Tuesday, the party's moneyed [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1097.2s)]
*  class was carefully monitoring post debate poll results and the positioning of elected Democrats [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1103.28s)]
*  for signs that support for Mr. Biden was cracking. At a breakfast on Friday morning at the Hotel [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1108.48s)]
*  Jerome in Aspen, Colorado, where nearly 50 Democratic donors had gathered for a pre-planned [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1114.48s)]
*  meeting convened by the Super PAC America Bridge, one person asked the crowd for a show of hands of [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1121.28s)]
*  how many thought Mr. Biden should step aside. Nearly everyone in the room raised their hands, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1126.8s)]
*  according to two people present. On a private email list, including members of another liberal [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1131.28s)]
*  donor collective called Way to Win, participants expressed frustration with the Democratic party's [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1136.8s)]
*  circling of the wagons around Mr. Biden and urged that Vice President Kamala Harris be considered [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1141.76s)]
*  for the top spot on the ticket. On Tuesday, both American Bridge and the Democratic Alliance hosted [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1148.48s)]
*  calls for donors. Anxious about the situation of the more than a dozen donors who spoke on the [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1154.48s)]
*  Bridge call, only one argued that the party should stick with Mr. Biden. Others expressed a desire [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1159.68s)]
*  to move on. The debate has particularly riven Democratic party donor groups that are typically [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1165.28s)]
*  fairly harmonious. At Way to Win, a donor collaborative founded during the peak of Trump [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1171.28s)]
*  era resistance, organization leaders have touted Ms. Harris as a potential replacement for Mr. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1176.48s)]
*  Biden. Jen Fernandez-Ancona, a founder of the group, stressed Mrs. Harris's electoral viability [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1182.16s)]
*  to allies in an internal email chain reviewed by the Times, quote, I absolutely believe we can do [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1188.4s)]
*  it with Harris at the top of the ticket and a good VP choice. Here's Ari Emanuel, the extremely [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1194.0800000000002s)]
*  wealthy Hollywood agent and brother of former Chicago mayor and Obama Chief of Staff, Rahm [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1201.2s)]
*  Emanuel, who is opining here at the Aspen Ideas Festival. These are where these people congregate. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1207.84s)]
*  These are the people who actually make the decisions while we call what we have a democracy. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1215.9199999999998s)]
*  Listen to what Ari Emanuel said. All right, Democrats are jumping out of the window. What [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1220.48s)]
*  are you thinking? Well, I'm pissed off at the Founding Fathers. They had the start date of 35. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1224.72s)]
*  They just didn't give us the end date. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1233.44s)]
*  Well, everybody died, so they didn't have to give the end date. I don't want to deal with [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1239.2s)]
*  Donald Trump and what he said was true. It's a given certain things. I'm not going to talk [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1247.2s)]
*  about CNN. Here's what Biden did. He said he was going to run for one term and he's doing it to [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1254.32s)]
*  restore democracy. He now runs for a second term. First bit of malarkey, as he would say. Then [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1264.08s)]
*  he says that this is for the quintessential thought about saving democracy and it's so important, [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1274.0s)]
*  etc. His cohorts have told us that he's healthy for over a year. I think it was two weeks ago [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1288.08s)]
*  there was an article in the Wall Street Journal and I had a father who died at 92 but at 81 I [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1300.08s)]
*  took away his car. It's a very simple test for me. If you were driving from downtown Beverly Hills [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1309.04s)]
*  to Malibu, would you want Biden to do it at night? Would you want Trump to do it at night? Neither. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1320.48s)]
*  Okay, so you just see his frame of reference there. If you're driving from Beverly Hills to [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1326.96s)]
*  Malibu, he's at the Aspen Ideas Festival. These are where decisions actually get made about [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1332.24s)]
*  American democracy. Just to underscore the point as the final article here from the New York Times, [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1337.92s)]
*  this was June 29th, that really kicked off the entire cycle of people like Ari Emanuel, very [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1344.64s)]
*  powerful, very rich, big donors to the Democratic Party who for the first time [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1349.76s)]
*  decided that they were going to criticize Joe Biden. They need to throw him out because they're [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1358.32s)]
*  worried he will lose to Trump. They don't care what the primary process resulted in. They don't [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1362.24s)]
*  care what Democratic Party registered voters decided, whether they wanted Biden or they don't [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1368.8799999999999s)]
*  care about any of that. These are the people who run the party. These are the people who fund the [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1376.4s)]
*  party. And therefore, it's like 500 of them run both parties. And the New York Times here tells [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1379.68s)]
*  the story, quote, major Democratic donors asked themselves what to do about Biden. Quote, some [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1387.8400000000001s)]
*  floated interventions and worried about how to reach and wondered about how to reach Jill Biden. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1393.76s)]
*  Others hoped the president would bow out of the race on his own. Many came to terms with the low [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1400.0s)]
*  chances that he will do so. The Democratic Party's perennially nervous donor class [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1404.88s)]
*  descended into deep unease on Friday as some of the wealthiest people in America commiserated [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1412.5600000000002s)]
*  over President Biden's weak debate performance and puzzled over what, if anything, they could [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1418.88s)]
*  do to change the course of the race. There were discussions with political advisors about arcane [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1422.96s)]
*  rules under which Mr. Biden might be removed from the ticket against his will [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1429.36s)]
*  and replaced after before the Democratic National Convention, according to a person familiar with [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1435.6799999999998s)]
*  the effort in Silicon Valley. A group of mega donors, including Ron Conway and Larene Powell [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1441.4399999999998s)]

*  possible catastrophe. Now, Ron Conway is one of those billionaire hedge fund managers. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1453.9199999999998s)]
*  Larene Powell jobs is not only the widow of Steve Jobs, which is where she got all of her billions [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1459.4399999999998s)]
*  of dollars from that she uses to fund the Democratic Party, but she's also the owner of The Atlantic, [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1464.24s)]
*  a magazine monomaniacally devoted to stopping Donald Trump. These are the people who, [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1470.72s)]
*  for all we want to call our society democracy and our voting political system of democracy, [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1477.28s)]
*  are the ones who actually run things. And you see them all like rats, like in secret, [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1481.6s)]
*  plotting about what they're going to do. Are they going to remove Joe Biden [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1486.6399999999999s)]
*  against his will? Are they going to try and get to Jill Biden and persuade her? Are they going to try [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1490.3999999999999s)]
*  and prop up Biden? Quote, the donors wondered about whom they could in the Biden fold. They [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1497.52s)]
*  could contact to reach Jill Biden, the first lady who in turn could persuade her husband not to run. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1504.24s)]
*  A Silicon Valley donor who had planned to host an intimate fundraiser featuring Mr. Biden this [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1509.84s)]
*  summer decided not to go through with the gathering because of the debate, according to a person told [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1514.32s)]
*  directly by the prospective host. Another major California donor left a debate watch party early [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1520.3999999999999s)]
*  and emailed a friend with the subject line, quote, utter disaster. In group chats and hushed [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1526.56s)]
*  discussions, some wealthy Democrats floated interventions and others hoped Mr. Biden would [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1531.52s)]
*  have an epiphany and decide to exit on his own and still more strategized about steering dollars to [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1537.92s)]
*  down ballot candidates. The most optimistic donors wanted to wait for the pull it up polling to see [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1543.52s)]
*  the scope of the fallout. The crisis in the donor class outlined in interviews of almost two dozen [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1549.04s)]
*  donors and fundraisers, many of whom insisted on anonymity to discuss their private conversations, [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1555.52s)]
*  could not come at a worse moment for Mr. Biden. Former president Donald J. Trump has outraised [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1560.72s)]
*  him in each of the last two months, erasing the president's one scaping financial advantage [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1565.44s)]
*  and opening one of his own. So on both sides, you see the total fraud of this democracy narrative. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1569.92s)]
*  You see the Democratic Party running their party with nothing resembling a democracy where voters [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1576.16s)]
*  have almost no say on purpose and the outcome of the election or who their nominee will be. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1582.88s)]
*  And then on the other side, you see who actually runs the party. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1589.92s)]
*  People like Steve Jobs' widow and hedge fund managers who fund the Democratic Party with [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1592.4s)]
*  hundreds of millions of dollars. This is why it was such a joke to hear in 2016 about how a few [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1597.92s)]
*  Facebook fake pages from Russia and a few Twitter bots somehow shifted the election when these [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1605.3600000000001s)]
*  elections are flooded with billions of dollars from the richest people in the United States who [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1612.72s)]
*  have immense power over each of the political parties and their agendas. And the idea that [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1618.0800000000002s)]
*  Democrats really do believe or that the media allies really do believe that somehow the [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1625.2s)]
*  Democratic Party is the sole guardian of, protector of, and believer in democratic values when the [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1628.96s)]
*  party is essentially the living, breathing antithesis of what democracy is supposed to be about [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1636.88s)]
*  is exactly the opposite of reality just as the narrative about what the Supreme Court ruling did [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1641.68s)]
*  and what its actual context is in history was all about. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37KAAbespU&t=1651.68s)]
