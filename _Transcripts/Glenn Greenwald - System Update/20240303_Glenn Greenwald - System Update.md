# Congress Triggered: No Safe Spaces for College Students
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [March 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w)
*  Well, last night we covered this new attempt to create a narrative that depicts Jewish [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=0.0s)]
*  Americans as a particularly vulnerable and especially endangered and vulnerable victim [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=12.72s)]
*  group of the United States. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=19.32s)]
*  There was a cover story by Time Magazine owned by a hardcore supporter of Israel billionaire [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=20.32s)]
*  and written by a longtime supporter of Israel Noah Feldman who was part of the Bush-Cheney [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=25.84s)]
*  effort to govern Iraq but also was a leading proponent of Trump's impeachment called the [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=30.6s)]
*  New Anti-Semitism on the Cover of Time. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=37.4s)]
*  We dissected that article and then you have Barry Weiss giving a speech on the 92nd Street [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=39.64s)]
*  Y after a Pulitzer Prize winning author had an event there who was canceled, who had his [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=43.96s)]
*  event canceled because he was a critic of Israel. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=49.44s)]
*  They invited Barry Weiss instead to come and speak on the state of American Jewry. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=51.28s)]
*  They had all these luminaries like Jerry Seinfeld in attendance and Barry Weiss told them that [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=56.04s)]
*  American Jews are unsafe in the United States. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=64.56s)]
*  They are the real victim group. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=69.2s)]
*  And obviously a lot of this is an attempt to shield Israel from criticism to imply that [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=71.04s)]
*  you become the new anti-Semite by questioning Biden's policy of financing Israel's war [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=75.08s)]
*  That's what this is all done, this is what that is all designed to achieve. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=81.32s)]
*  Now today House Republicans who have spent years mocking the notion that students need [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=85.64s)]
*  to feel safe from criticism, from protests, from ideas that upset them on campus, mocking [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=97.36s)]
*  these people as fragile children who need to suck on their little blankets and get therapy [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=103.6s)]
*  dogs in safe spaces, ever since October 7th have decided that Jewish students are unsafe [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=110.52s)]
*  not because they're being physically assaulted. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=116.44s)]
*  The number of Jewish students who have been injured because of physical attacks on American [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=120.72s)]
*  campuses since October 7th is zero or close to zero. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=124.67999999999999s)]
*  Certainly nowhere near a kind of epidemic of the sort they're trying to depict. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=130.6s)]
*  What they're actually saying is that Jewish students are unsafe not because they're being [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=134.12s)]
*  physically assaulted or threatened with physical violence but because the words they're hearing [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=137.12s)]
*  are violent. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=141.92000000000002s)]
*  Words are violence. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=143.52s)]
*  That was the claim of the liberal left for years to try and usher in censorship in the [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=145.84s)]
*  name of protecting marginalized groups and apparently a lot of people on the American [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=150.96s)]
*  right eager to shield Israel from criticism believe that that theory is absolutely true. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=154.32s)]
*  It just doesn't belong being invoked to protect black people or Latinos or immigrants or [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=162.88s)]
*  Muslims or trans people or gay people or women or anybody else, only American Jews. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=168.72s)]
*  That's where it's valid. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=173.07999999999998s)]
*  That somehow even though if you look at the metrics of American Jews it's hard to find [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=176.2s)]
*  a group thriving more and you have these students at the top most elite college campuses from [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=179.48s)]
*  Harvard and Yale and Princeton and MIT and Penn and Columbia proclaiming themselves victims [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=188.68s)]
*  when as Batya and Grisaghar said in the video we showed you it's hard to imagine anybody [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=193.88s)]
*  more privileged than they and yet we had a congressional hearing today where Jewish students [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=199.04000000000002s)]
*  were paraded around and they talked about their victimhood status. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=208.12s)]
*  Again none of them were physically assaulted. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=211.04000000000002s)]
*  They're upset by pro-Palestinian protesters and you had people like Elise Stefanik whose [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=214.48s)]
*  big star-making moment was when she demanded more censorship from college administrators [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=219.92s)]
*  who said we have to look at the context of these statements to decide. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=224.66s)]
*  Threatening these college administrators again is saying we're going to get more safety from [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=229.56s)]
*  you for these students no matter what. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=232.72s)]
*  Here was the New York Times account of it today. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=235.56s)]
*  Quote, Jewish students described facing anti-Semitism on campus to members of Congress. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=237.32s)]
*  Now just let's imagine that this headline said something slightly different. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=241.56s)]
*  Instead of Jewish students let's imagine that it said black students. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=247.4s)]
*  I don't think I can write in this pen but black students describe facing racism on camp [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=252.6s)]
*  Yeah this is barely literate. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=265.56s)]
*  It looks like the scratching of some kind of neurotic person in the middle of a seizure [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=268.32s)]
*  but I'm asking you to imagine a headline that said instead of this black students described [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=272.84s)]
*  feeling facing racism on campus to members of Congress. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=277.76s)]
*  At a discussion held by a House panel student criticized the university for not cracking [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=281.68s)]
*  down on racism. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=286.84000000000003s)]
*  An anti-war group pointed out that Muslim and Arab students are facing harassment too. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=289.84000000000003s)]
*  People would mock this. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=293.76s)]
*  They would say oh these poor marginalized self-victimized students at Harvard and Yale [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=294.96s)]
*  constantly talking about how bad they have it but because it's not Jewish students, it's [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=300.0s)]
*  not black students claiming they face racism on campus but instead it's Jewish students [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=304.8s)]
*  claiming they face anti-Semitism everything switches and suddenly the Republicans that [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=309.71999999999997s)]
*  would ordinarily be mocking the safety narrative suddenly embrace them. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=314.12s)]
*  And again don't say that it's different because this is physical endangerment because it's [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=317.32s)]
*  not. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=323.24s)]
*  No one claims these students have been assaulted or threatened with violence or the victims [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=325.4s)]
*  of violence. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=328.18s)]
*  They're upset and angry that people are writing off ads and protesting in defense of Palestinians [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=329.18s)]
*  against against Israel. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=335.46s)]
*  Here is what the article says. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=338.41999999999996s)]
*  Quote, nine Jewish students from prominent universities told members of Congress on Thursday [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=342.74s)]
*  that they feel unsafe on campus but that their complaints of anti-Semitism had been waved [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=348.62s)]
*  away by university administrators. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=353.40000000000003s)]
*  At a bipartisan roundtable organized by the House Committee on Education in the workforce, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=356.0s)]
*  the students described various episodes of anti-Semitism they had experienced on campus [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=361.0s)]
*  since the October 7th attack by Hamas on Israel accusing their schools of pandering to violent [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=365.28000000000003s)]
*  and disruptive protesters while minimizing the threat to Jewish students. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=370.44s)]
*  Several investigations are underway to examine claims of anti-Semitism and anti-Muslim bias [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=374.88s)]
*  on campuses. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=379.84000000000003s)]
*  The Department of Education has opened inquiries into discrimination against Muslim students [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=381.64s)]
*  at Harvard and other universities. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=385.59999999999997s)]
*  And the House Committee is investigating anti-Semitism at Harvard, Penn, MIT, and Columbia. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=388.06s)]
*  And Ms. Fox has said the examination could be expanded. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=393.28s)]
*  The roundtable would help inform next steps in the inquiry, she said. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=395.7s)]
*  Passionate, angry, and defiant, the students on Thursday repeatedly described feeling scared [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=400.28s)]
*  and abandoned in spite of their efforts to be heard by university officials. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=405.36s)]
*  Now this is exactly what I was describing earlier as an abandonment of principles for [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=410.0s)]
*  immediate political convenience and political gain. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=413.48s)]
*  You have the entire right mocking cancel culture, censorship, victimhood narratives, never since [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=416.52000000000004s)]
*  October 7th, much of the right, not all of it, but much of it, in the name of protecting [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=421.78000000000003s)]
*  Israel has embraced all those narratives. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=425.16s)]
*  Not ironically, because for many, many years, this is not new, as we've devoted shows to [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=427.40000000000003s)]
*  documenting. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=434.56s)]
*  Israel critics, both students and faculty, have been among the most frequent targets [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=436.92s)]
*  of cancer censorship. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=441.42s)]
*  That is just true. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=442.52s)]
*  One organization that was extremely happy with the House Republicans today was the Anti-Defamation [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=445.12s)]
*  League. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=450.06s)]
*  Its chairman, Jonathan Greenblatt, who is executive director, tweeted the following, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=451.5s)]
*  quote, powerful testimony in Congress today from a Jewish MIT student. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=456.52s)]
*  It's unacceptable that college administrators are not taking physical threats made against [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=461.12s)]
*  their Jewish students seriously. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=465.44s)]
*  It's beyond time that they listen and act to make their campuses safer. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=467.92s)]
*  Here was a video from the House Committee on Education, which was the committee that [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=473.52s)]
*  held this hearing, and you can see some of the students there. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=479.76s)]
*  That they can't police free speech, but this is not about free speech. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=482.4s)]
*  And I think that's one thing that we've noticed is that there are actual threats. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=486.0s)]
*  There are people's offices who have been attacked. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=490.96s)]
*  People have banged on office doors, tried to unlock office doors, and that has nothing [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=493.82s)]
*  to do with free speech. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=498.91999999999996s)]
*  That is people's lives at risk. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=499.91999999999996s)]
*  That is people fearing physical violence. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=502.0s)]
*  There have been people calling for physical violence on our campus, and literally nothing [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=503.88s)]
*  has been done. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=508.08s)]
*  All right, let me just say this. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=509.08s)]
*  If you are somebody who is in an office and someone trying to physically break into your [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=511.71999999999997s)]
*  office to do physical harm as she's claiming, or if someone is calling and threatening you [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=516.3199999999999s)]
*  with physical violence, you don't call the dean, you call the police. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=519.9s)]
*  Those are already crimes. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=522.62s)]
*  Those are crimes that the police are duty bound to investigate and to arrest anybody [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=525.9399999999999s)]
*  who's trying to break into your office, trespass to your office or your home to try and harm [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=529.14s)]
*  you physically. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=533.5799999999999s)]
*  If that's what's happening, those are already crimes. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=534.5799999999999s)]
*  But the vast bulk of these grievances are always, oh, we hear protests, we hear slants, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=539.38s)]
*  chants, we hear slogans. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=542.9s)]
*  And if all it is is this, then why do you need to go to Congress? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=546.34s)]
*  Call the police. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=549.1s)]
*  The police presumably take crimes like this seriously. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=551.38s)]
*  Now here is the Republican Congresswoman, Elise Stepanek, who, as I said, made her big [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=555.26s)]
*  star turn moment when questioning... [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=561.38s)]
*  That answer, and just straight... [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=563.74s)]
*  Here she's questioning the student. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=570.4200000000001s)]
*  Thank you for that answer. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=572.34s)]
*  And just straight to the cameras, for the lawyers for these universities have failed. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=573.5400000000001s)]
*  If you think this is going to get brushed under the rug, the list is getting longer [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=578.46s)]
*  by the day. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=582.62s)]
*  This Congress will not stop until we hold you accountable. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=583.62s)]
*  That's a promise. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=586.62s)]
*  Now again, you bring any other group, black students, Latinos, immigrants, trans people, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=589.94s)]
*  LGBTs, Muslims, to the same committee, to these same members of Congress, and they will [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=599.5s)]
*  mock the idea that they deserve safe spaces. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=603.6600000000001s)]
*  And presumably if they're complaining of violence, they will say, call the police. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=606.38s)]
*  But every single thing that the American right has claimed for years to mock when it comes [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=612.06s)]
*  from the left, they have been embracing since October 7th. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=617.02s)]
*  Again, not all parts of the American right. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=620.22s)]
*  There are a lot of parts of the American right, including prominent right-wing officials and [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=622.02s)]
*  pundits and journalists who have said no to a lot of this, especially the attempts to [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=627.1s)]
*  impose censorship in the name of protecting Israel, to equate Israel criticism with anti-Semitism. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=633.54s)]
*  But this is completely recognizable as the kind of victimhood narrative that many conservatives [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=639.9399999999999s)]
*  have long scorned and mocked when applied to literally every other victim group, every [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=646.54s)]
*  other minority group, every other marginalized group. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=652.38s)]
*  And suddenly since October 7th, they've found great political value in disseminating this [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=654.38s)]
*  narrative. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=661.3s)]
*  One of the ways that you can know if you're a marginalized group is whether you have access [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=662.9399999999999s)]
*  to or excluded from the key institutions of society. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=666.42s)]
*  So when you have access to the cover of Time magazine, and when you're getting invited [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=671.5799999999999s)]
*  to speak at the 92nd Street, why when a Pulitzer Prize-winning author has his event canceled [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=674.78s)]
*  because he's criticizing Israel, and when the House Republican Congress repeatedly opens [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=681.4599999999999s)]
*  the doors to you of Congress to invite you in and to venerate your grievances? [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=685.6999999999999s)]
*  Those are not indicia of marginalization, but quite the contrary. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nSWgLrF3w&t=691.22s)]
