# Glenn DISMANTLES Marco Rubioâ€™s Deportation Lies
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [April 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M)
*  Here's Marco Rubio when being asked about what the justification is for having deported [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=0.0s)]
*  this Turkish PhD student whose crime is writing it out bad. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=13.06s)]
*  Here's how he quote unquote responded. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, a Turkish student in Boston was detained and handcuffed on the street [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=20.36s)]
*  by plainclothes agents. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=26.0s)]
*  A year ago, she wrote an opinion piece about the Gaza war. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=27.5s)]
*  Could you help us understand what the specific action she took led to her visa being revoked? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=30.82s)]
*  What was your State Department's role in that process? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=38.38s)]
*  We revoked her visa. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=41.7s)]
*  It's an F1 visa, I believe. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=42.7s)]
*  We revoked it and here's why. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=45.260000000000005s)]
*  And I'll say it again, I said it everywhere. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=46.7s)]
*  Let me be abundantly clear. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=48.18s)]
*  If you go apply for a visa right now, anywhere in the world, let me just send this message [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=49.7s)]
*  out. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=53.58s)]
*  If you apply for a visa to enter the United States and be a student and you tell us that [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=54.58s)]
*  the reason why you're coming to the United States is not just because you want to write [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=58.379999999999995s)]
*  op-eds but because you want to participate in movements that are involved in doing things [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=61.699999999999996s)]
*  like vandalizing universities, harassing students, taking over buildings, creating a ruckus, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=65.78s)]
*  we're not going to give you a visa. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=71.38s)]
*  If you lie to us and get a visa and then enter the United States and with that visa participate [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=73.3s)]
*  in that sort of activity, we're going to take away your visa. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=78.06s)]
*  She didn't do any of that. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=80.82s)]
*  This is a completely deceitful statement designed to mask what they're actually doing. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=82.16s)]
*  They promised mass deportations of people in the country illegally. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=90.02s)]
*  They're not giving that to you. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=93.64s)]
*  Joe Biden deported more people in these two months of last year than Donald Trump did. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=97.03999999999999s)]
*  Obama deported way more. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=103.75999999999999s)]
*  The immigration group's called Obama the deporter in chief because of how many people he deported. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=105.03999999999999s)]
*  Now they have closed the border almost entirely. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=111.96s)]
*  It's like down 94 percent and sometimes the deportation count comes from deporting people [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=115.24s)]
*  when they're detained at the border but there's nothing even remotely like mass deportations [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=122.55999999999999s)]
*  taking place of people in the United States illegally. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=127.03999999999999s)]
*  Their priority is not even people in the United States illegally. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=129.56s)]
*  Their priority is people who are in the United States illegally who committed the ultimate [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=132.74s)]
*  crime of criticizing Israel and they're lying to justify it. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=137.2s)]
*  Everybody knows she didn't go and vandalize anything. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=141.88s)]
*  No one suggests that she did anything illegal, anything aggressive, anything violent. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=144.76s)]
*  The only reason she ended up on these lists from these pro-Israel groups that are dictating [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=151.79999999999998s)]
*  to the US government who can and cannot stay in the United States is because she wrote [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=156.72s)]
*  this op-ed and I want to show you that op-ed in a second just to let you decide if you [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=160.84s)]
*  think it's anything radical let alone remotely pro-Hamas or glorifying terrorism other than [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=165.24s)]
*  unless you think that criticizing Israel or opposing Israel is inherently to be pro-terrorist [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=172.44s)]
*  which is what a lot of people think they just don't usually admit it and that's why Mark [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=177.56s)]
*  Ruby has to fabricate a bunch of claims that he knows isn't true about her when her only [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=180.84s)]
*  crime was writing this op-ed. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=185.48000000000002s)]
*  Here's the rest of him. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=187.64000000000001s)]
*  Now once you've lost your visa you're no longer legally in the United States and we have a [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=188.64000000000001s)]
*  right like every country in the world has a right to remove you from our country. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=193.04s)]
*  So it's just that simple. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=196.76s)]
*  I think it's crazy. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=198.16s)]
*  I think it's stupid for any country in the world to welcome people into their country [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=199.16s)]
*  that are going to go to your universities as visitors. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=203.07999999999998s)]
*  They're visitors and say I'm going to your universities to start a riot. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=205.84s)]
*  I'm going to your universities to take over a library and harass people. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=210.32s)]
*  I don't care what movement you're involved in. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=214.4s)]
*  Why would any country in the world allow people to come and disrupt? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=216.44s)]
*  We gave you a visa to come and study and get a degree not to become a social activist that [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=219.6s)]
*  tears up our university campuses and if we've given you a visa and then you decide to do [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=224.6s)]
*  that we're going to take it away. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=228.72s)]
*  I encourage every country to do that by the way because I think it's crazy to invite students [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=229.88s)]
*  into your country that are coming onto your campus and destabilizing it. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=234.12s)]
*  We're just not going to have it. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=237.88s)]
*  So we'll revoke your visa and once your visa is revoked you're illegally in the country. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=239.07999999999998s)]
*  By the way not only is that a complete fabrication for this Turkish PhD student at Tufts it's [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=243.0s)]
*  also a complete fabrication of what happened to Mahmoud Khalil the first person in the [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=249.48s)]
*  United States legally who was snatched up under this program. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=256.92s)]
*  He was in the US legally and he didn't vandalize any buildings. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=260.71999999999997s)]
*  He didn't occupy any buildings. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=269.84s)]
*  He didn't attack anybody. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=271.8s)]
*  And also I just want to say this whole framework of oh this is happening because the people [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=275.8s)]
*  lied on their visa applications. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=280.71999999999997s)]
*  If you apply for a student visa in 2022 or 2023 before October 7th you're not prescient. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=282.32s)]
*  You can't see the future. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=290.76s)]
*  You don't know that the Israelis are going to destroy Gaza and all of civilian life in [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=291.8s)]
*  Gaza in a way that pretty much every human rights group in the world has said has been [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=296.56s)]
*  unparalleled and unseen in decades. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=301.71999999999997s)]
*  They're not professional protesters. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=306.28s)]
*  They rose up and protested like a lot of people did in response to what the Israelis were [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=308.6s)]
*  doing in Gaza. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=311.8s)]
*  Something they couldn't have known at the time they applied for their visa. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=312.8s)]
*  But there is nothing on the visa application that says are you a critic of Israel? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=316.04s)]
*  Do you oppose Israel? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=321.16s)]
*  Do you believe in the Palestinian cause? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=322.56s)]
*  Because of course that is well within the realm of free speech. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=324.36s)]
*  Here's the rest of Marco Rubio. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=328.76s)]
*  You have to leave. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=329.76s)]
*  Every country in the world has a right to decide who comes in as a visitor and who doesn't. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=331.16s)]
*  If you invite me into your home because you say I want to come to your house for dinner [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=335.28000000000003s)]
*  and I go to your house and I start putting mud on your couch and spray painting your [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=339.48s)]
*  kitchen I bet you're going to kick me out. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=342.76s)]
*  Well we're going to do the same thing if you come into the United States as a visitor and [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=344.84s)]
*  create a ruckus for us. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=348.68s)]
*  We don't want it. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=349.8s)]
*  We don't want it in our country. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=350.8s)]
*  Go back and do it in your country. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=351.8s)]
*  But you're not going to do it in our country. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=352.8s)]
*  Sure. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=354.88s)]
*  Just tell me your follow up and I'll tell. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=355.88s)]
*  Depending on your question I'll answer it or not. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=357.88s)]
*  All right. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=360.96s)]
*  I know invite all of the guys. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=361.96s)]
*  Can I get a follow up real quick? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=362.96s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=363.96s)]
*  Could you confirm there's been a report that 300 people stay for this and we're both 300. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=364.96s)]
*  Maybe more. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=371.52s)]
*  Might be more than 300 at this point. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=372.52s)]
*  We do it every day. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=373.52s)]
*  Every time I find one of these lunatics I take away their visa. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=374.52s)]
*  You're saying it could be more than 300 people. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=376.96s)]
*  Sure. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=378.52s)]
*  I mean at some point I hope we run out because we've gotten rid of all of them. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=379.52s)]
*  But we're looking every day. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=383.2s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=385.32s)]
*  Like I said these are all false claims. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=386.32s)]
*  False claims. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=387.96s)]
*  Some of the leading protesters of Columbia who occupied Hamilton Hall were American Jewish [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=391.08s)]
*  students who are now expelled because the Trump administration required it. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=394.84s)]
*  So congratulations on protecting American Jews by getting them expelled from college [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=401.4s)]
*  for protesting. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=405.15999999999997s)]
*  Fantastic. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=406.79999999999995s)]
*  Jews all over are very grateful. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=408.35999999999996s)]
*  But these are not the people who have been doing this. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=411.67999999999995s)]
*  The people they're targeting. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=414.52s)]
*  And they're prioritizing it over what they promised people in the campaign that people [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=415.52s)]
*  voted for them on the basis of not removing legal immigrants who are Israel critics but [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=419.2s)]
*  removing people and mass deporting people who are in the country illegally. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=424.72s)]
*  They're not doing that. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=427.92s)]
*  This is their priority. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=429.26000000000005s)]
*  To protect Israel from criticism and activism. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd6JlWTz5M&t=430.68s)]
