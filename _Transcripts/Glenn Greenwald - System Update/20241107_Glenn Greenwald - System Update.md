# Dems Blame Latino and Black Voters For Kamala's Loss
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [November 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A)
*  I just want to show you a couple of reactions to what happened here [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=0.0s)]
*  throughout the week leading up to the election and then also in response to it [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=13.92s)]
*  as well. So as I was saying people in cable studios and on the op-ed pages [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=18.68s)]
*  make a great deal of money, they never interact with people who are ordinary [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=27.82s)]
*  voters, and so they have no idea what people care about and don't. Here was [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=31.740000000000002s)]
*  Nicole Wallace, the former Bush Cheney speechwriter turned popular liberal MSNBC [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=36.620000000000005s)]
*  host on November 4th listening to a JD Vans speech and she claimed that what [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=41.14s)]
*  JD Vans said here was one of the worst mistakes, was the worst mistake she has [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=50.260000000000005s)]
*  ever seen in politics and basically implied that it would destroy the Trump [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=55.1s)]
*  Vans campaign just because of this. Listen to what she said. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=59.42s)]
*  See and the trash's name is Kamala Harris. Forgive me one more time. In two days we are [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=63.06s)]
*  going to take out the trash in Washington DC and the trash's name is [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=76.26s)]
*  Kamala Harris. In my humble view, lights out. Women, you can disagree with us. We've [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=80.1s)]
*  actually learned to take it for our whole careers all the time in every forum, but [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=89.33999999999999s)]
*  you call us trash? Oh, oh, oh JD Vans. You just deft up in a way that I've never [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=94.1s)]
*  seen in my political life and I worked for Sarah Palin. I mean what's this [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=102.1s)]
*  happen? I mean she was essentially implying very clearly that that one [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=106.06s)]
*  comment where she was saying this is all based on the garbage comment where Biden [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=114.54s)]
*  said and it wasn't a big deal he just sort of said it because his brain wasn't [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=120.06s)]
*  working the only garbage I see is Trump supporters and then in response JD Vans [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=124.78s)]
*  said we're gonna be taking up the garbage on Election Day and her name is [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=128.5s)]
*  Nicole Wallace said oh lights out. I'm speaking here for all women. This [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=132.45999999999998s)]
*  multimillionaire who works in the studio who's been in the White House and [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=138.78s)]
*  American political life for decades she speaks for all American women. She's here [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=142.54s)]
*  to say that if you call any women politician garbage American women are [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=146.85999999999999s)]
*  going to rise up in unison and destroy you. That's how much of a fantasy world [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=152.57999999999998s)]
*  these people live in where they're focused on the most blatant trivialities [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=161.26s)]
*  because that's the only things they care about in their lives and the American [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=166.62s)]
*  voter obviously could not care less about any of it and it's so obvious they [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=171.3s)]
*  do this every day and yet nobody listened to them and there will never be [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=175.54s)]
*  self-reflection. In fact most of the reaction was to blame the voters for [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=179.42s)]
*  being stupid for being racist. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=184.26000000000002s)]
*  You're gonna see a kind of level of contempt being spewed by liberals at [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=188.26000000000002s)]
*  these groups that is ugly and barely contained and this is just not even 24 [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=195.94s)]
*  hours later. We've shown you before how when they sent Barack Obama to Pennsylvania [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=201.18s)]
*  to talk to black male voters reluctant to vote for Kamala Harris instead of [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=207.78s)]
*  trying to convince them that voting for her would improve their lives he just [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=212.54s)]
*  hector them and judge them and condemn them saying you're probably just [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=217.02s)]
*  misogynist afraid to vote for a woman. This is how Democrats behave always if [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=221.1s)]
*  they see someone out of line and not doing what they're told it always must [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=227.82s)]
*  be because that person has something wrong with them. It can never be the [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=231.18s)]
*  fault of the Democratic Party. Here this morning on Morning Joe with Al Sharpton [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=235.06s)]
*  they had a discussion about this significant increase in Latino voters [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=241.3s)]
*  for Donald Trump and this got out of hand pretty quickly. I just say really [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=246.74s)]
*  quickly too Democrats need to be mature and they need to be honest and they need [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=253.02s)]
*  to say yes there is there's misogyny but it's not just misogyny from white men [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=259.34000000000003s)]
*  it's misogyny from Hispanic men right it's misogyny from black men things [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=265.98s)]
*  we've all been talking about who do not want a woman leading them might be race [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=271.34000000000003s)]
*  issues with Hispanics they don't want a black woman as President. You know the [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=276.86s)]
*  Democratic Party I've always found when you're sitting around talking they love [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=283.82s)]
*  to just sort of balkanize everybody into these separate groups and say oh white [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=287.18s)]
*  people don't like women and black people. No this is it is time for the [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=294.26s)]
*  Democrats to say okay and you and I've talked about this before a lot of [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=300.82s)]
*  Hispanic voters have problems with black candidates. Right. And with other Hispanics. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=305.65999999999997s)]
*  Exactly. And some of the most misogynist things I've heard going on [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=312.09999999999997s)]
*  and there's get out the vote tour came from black men I mean misogynist things [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=318.9s)]
*  so you're absolutely right it's not simplistic and we've got to have real [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=323.38s)]
*  honest conversations about it. Real honest conversations. Real honest [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=327.26s)]
*  conversations time to come down hardcore on these people for their misbehavior you [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=332.42s)]
*  see a bunch of millionaires sitting in a cable studio and they're saying those [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=337.38s)]
*  black voters those Latina voters who didn't vote for Democrats they're just [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=341.42s)]
*  bigots they they're hateful they have big problems with misogyny this is what [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=347.26s)]
*  Democrats do all the time. They cannot engage in self-critique it they cannot [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=352.74s)]
*  conceive of why people don't vote for them except for something defective or [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=359.3s)]
*  wrong with the person and obviously that's a big part of the perception that [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=364.38s)]
*  people have that liberal elites look down upon them speak with them and about [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=369.18s)]
*  them with condescension are very snide and patronizing because it's exactly [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=374.02s)]
*  what they are. Here's former Obama advisor David Axelrod on CNN talking about some of the reasons [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=379.82s)]
*  Kamala lost. It wasn't a mandate to wantonly use the power of the presidency [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=386.85999999999996s)]
*  to punish his political enemies it wasn't a mandate to help enrich himself [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=394.65999999999997s)]
*  and his friends it wasn't a mandate to single out groups in our society for [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=400.26s)]
*  scorn or worse you know I'd love to hear from Van on this but let's be honest [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=408.14000000000004s)]
*  about this okay let's be absolutely blunt about it there were appeals to [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=416.26s)]
*  racism in this campaign and there is racial bias in this country and there is [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=421.34000000000003s)]
*  sexism in this country and anybody who thinks that that did not in any way [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=425.66s)]

*  Kamala Harris's defeat on the unwillingness of Americans to vote for a [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=447.98s)]

*  problem with the Democratic Party for as long as I can remember if you remember [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=667.76s)]
*  after Hillary lost a very winnable race in 2016 she had a long list of people to [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=671.4s)]
*  blame Jim Comey the New York Times WikiLeaks Jill Stein it went on and on [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=676.16s)]
*  and on on Putin of course and the one thing Hillary Clinton never did or [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=685.12s)]
*  anyone close to Hillary Clinton ever did is to say what is it that we're [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=691.28s)]
*  presenting to the American people that makes us so unlikable why is it that we [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=694.7199999999999s)]
*  are so incapable of getting Americans to like us and wanting to vote for us even [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=700.6999999999999s)]
*  if we're running against Donald Trump and I think maybe 2020 concealed that a [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=705.96s)]
*  little bit because of the extraordinary reality of COVID remembered Biden didn't [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=712.84s)]

*  felt like there was a lot of chaos going on it makes sense that they would want [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=721.6s)]
*  to reach out to somebody who seems more stable which is Biden who's been around [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=724.64s)]
*  forever but even that was an extremely close election now I think they're back [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=728.1600000000001s)]
*  to having to grapple with the fact that they are a party that Americans hate but [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=731.92s)]
*  they cannot and will not ask why what is it about them that has made that what [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=738.4799999999999s)]
*  about their ideology what about how they do politics no it's that people are [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=743.52s)]
*  racist and stupid and misogynistic and just not good enough people to [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=748.24s)]
*  appreciate the glory of the Democratic Party candidate exactly like their media [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=753.68s)]
*  allies when seeing why it is that or seeing that they've completely lost the [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=757.88s)]
*  faith and trust of the American public refused to ask what they did to cause it [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=764.56s)]
*  now one of the things we're going to be covering over the next two weeks very [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=770.4399999999999s)]
*  intensively in next several weeks or probably longer is starting to watch how [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=773.8s)]
*  Donald Trump's administration take shape because the big question mark for a [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=778.76s)]
*  Donald Trump presidency to me has always been is he going to make the same [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=782.92s)]
*  mistakes that he made in the first administration where he admitted so many [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=786.48s)]
*  people into his administration and powerful positions who did not clearly [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=790.6s)]
*  not share his stated ideology often subverted it simply because they [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=795.88s)]
*  flattered him people like Mike Pompeo or Nikki Haley John Bolton and on and on [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=802.88s)]
*  or and I've heard this from a lot of people close to Trump and from that [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=807.4s)]
*  circle itself no this time he really learned his lesson he understands that [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=813.64s)]
*  there's a lot of snakes in Washington trying to slither their way into his [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=818.76s)]
*  good graces in order to undermine and subvert him not to promote what he wants [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=822.52s)]
*  and this time they're going to be very village it vigilant I wasn't very [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=828.08s)]
*  reassured when I saw Mike Pompeo probably the worst person the worst [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=832.52s)]
*  mistake of Trump's first term where Trump made him the CIA director and then [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=835.72s)]
*  moved him to the Secretary of State he stayed there all four years and in the [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=842.96s)]
*  position of CIA director he actually plotted to murder Julian Assange he was [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=846.76s)]
*  more responsible than anybody for getting the asylum from Ecuador elliptic [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=850.7800000000001s)]
*  so they could arrest Assange getting Assange indicted and just a standard [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=855.24s)]
*  warmonger in neocon for a long time and at the very last couple rallies in [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=860.2800000000001s)]
*  Pennsylvania Pompeo was there he spoke he was welcomed by Trump on the stage [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=865.52s)]
*  bench bureau said we're trying to convince Sam Harris and Barry Weiss that [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=871.16s)]
*  Trump was going to be very reliable for Israel said I have it on good authority [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=876.4399999999999s)]
*  that Mike Pompeo was going to be in a position of very high influence now [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=879.88s)]
*  there are a lot of different factions around Trump that wield a lot of say and [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=886.4s)]
*  there's going to be a kind of factional conflict so that's something that we're [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=890.24s)]
*  going to have to keep an eye on I'm sure that's something we're going to be [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=894.4399999999999s)]
*  covering a great deal as the next couple of weeks unfolds leading up to the [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=896.52s)]
*  transition into the Trump presidency but this election last night could not [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=901.0s)]
*  have been better constructed to show the elite class the media how worthless they [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=907.32s)]
*  are how out of touch they are how despised they are how irrelevant they [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=914.56s)]
*  are and yet the chances that they're going to start to ask those questions [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=919.52s)]
*  there's been a couple of articles saying wait are we really so out of touch that [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=924.28s)]
*  nobody even listens us to anymore how can it be that we all agree that Trump is [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=930.56s)]
*  Hitler and yet the whole country just went by an overwhelming margin and voted [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=934.68s)]
*  for Hitler it's finally dawning on them like maybe they don't listen to us [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=938.1999999999999s)]
*  anymore oh you think maybe they get their information from other places and [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=942.28s)]
*  not from them but I don't think it's going to lead to any self-critique it [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=947.8s)]
*  can't they're too ingrained and too embedded into those cultural assumptions [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=951.24s)]
*  and I think ultimately they're just going to wither away and wither away and [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=955.84s)]
*  die and die and die they may be floated by the big corporations that support [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=960.28s)]
*  them and can afford to suffer their loss but there clearly is a massive realignment [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=964.72s)]
*  not just of voters but of the way people get information in the way people trust [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=971.28s)]
*  information and that can only be a positive thing given how destructive and [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=975.9599999999999s)]
*  how deliberately dishonest corporate media has been. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuyANh7_r7A&t=980.16s)]
