# Neocon Queen Victoria Nuland ADMITS Not Wanting to End Ukraine War Diplomatically
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [September 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q)
*  A video emerged where this interviewer Mikhail Zygar interviewed Victoria [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=0.0s)]
*  Nuland who used to be Dick Cheney's top foreign policy advisor then ran Ukraine [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=13.48s)]
*  for Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and now runs Ukraine for Joe Biden. The only [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=19.92s)]
*  time she was out of power was when Donald Trump was in office. She's now [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=26.52s)]
*  left the government I think in part because she didn't get the promotion she [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=30.12s)]
*  wanted. She wanted to be Secretary of State. It didn't look like she was going [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=33.72s)]
*  to get it so she's out for now but she's still the architect, one of the main [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=36.36s)]
*  architects not only of the war in Ukraine but also the ten-year earlier coup [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=39.879999999999995s)]
*  that led to the ousting of the democratically elected president who was [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=44.72s)]
*  too close to Moscow in the view of Victoria Nuland and replaced by somebody [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=49.04s)]
*  she chose who the US could borrow control and she's asked here about reports that at the very start there were active robust [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=53.24s)]
*  negotiations between the Ukrainians and Russians to resolve this before it [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=60.36s)]
*  became this war and that the UK under Boris Johnson especially the US as well [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=63.56s)]
*  intervened and put a stop to those negotiations to make sure that this war [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=68.96s)]
*  continued instead it wasn't peacefully resolved and here's what she said when [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=72.88s)]
*  asked. There was a story first told by former Israeli Prime Minister Neftal [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=76.4s)]
*  Taliban that both sides were really close to the end to the the [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=80.96s)]
*  successful end of the negotiations and then Prime Minister Boris Johnson [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=86.03999999999999s)]
*  interfered and stopped Ukrainians prevented Ukrainians from signing [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=91.28s)]
*  the deal and then Ukrainian representative Arahami kind of confirmed [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=98.28s)]
*  that yes he said in an interview that there was some kind of advice from Boris [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=103.75999999999999s)]
*  Johnson to stop negotiating and to win this war militarily. Where is the myth? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=109.56s)]
*  Where is the truth? I mean look at that nauseating grin but I just want to make [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=116.76s)]
*  clear what that question was. He wasn't just asking hey by the way were there [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=120.86s)]
*  some negotiations that you stopped? He was citing extremely knowledgeable [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=125.56s)]
*  first-hand sources such as the Prime Minister of Israel at the time Neftali [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=129.16s)]
*  Bennett and even high-level members of the Ukrainian Parliament who have said [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=132.76s)]
*  publicly there was a ton of progress between Moscow and Kiev early in the [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=138.3s)]
*  war February and March where essentially Ukraine would agree not to seek NATO [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=144.3s)]
*  membership it would provide a sort of semi-autonomous zone in the eastern [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=150.36s)]
*  part of Ukraine as well as in Crimea where by the way the people of Crimea [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=157.16000000000003s)]
*  the people in eastern Ukraine identify far more with Russia than they do with [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=162.22000000000003s)]
*  the Zelensky government in Ukraine and then essentially would assuage Russia's [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=165.8s)]
*  concerns without having the Ukrainians face a destruction of a generation of [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=172.42000000000002s)]
*  men by dying in a war and the destruction of their country and leaving [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=177.88000000000002s)]
*  it as a rump state. So there's people who with very reliable knowledge who have [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=182.56s)]
*  said explicitly that that was happening and that it was the British and [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=188.4s)]
*  Americans who intervened and put a stop to those negotiations and that's what as [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=193.52s)]
*  she sits there and grins this is what the interview asked for and here's what [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=197.72s)]
*  she said. Where is the truth? Relatively late in the game the Ukrainians began asking for [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=202.52s)]
*  advice on where this thing was going and it became clear to us clear to the [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=211.52s)]
*  Brits clear to others that Putin's main condition was buried in an annex to this [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=218.92s)]
*  document that they were working on and it included limits on the precise kinds [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=229.0s)]
*  of weapons systems that Ukraine could have after the deal such that Ukraine [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=235.48s)]
*  would basically be neutered as a military force. Now let me just say she's [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=241.07999999999998s)]
*  first of all notice here that the whole premise the conceit of that entire [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=247.04s)]
*  answer is oh the Ukrainians were really dumb they thought like they had a chance [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=250.28s)]
*  to make a deal with Russians but we their masters in London and Washington [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=254.16s)]
*  we saw something they didn't understand that buried in this appendix was the [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=259.32s)]
*  real Putin goal namely that he wanted to limit the amount of weapons that were [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=264.48s)]
*  present on Ukrainian soil precisely because the West has long been saying [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=268.24s)]
*  that they're gonna make Ukraine part of NATO the West changed the government in [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=273.44s)]
*  Kiev right on the other side of the most sensitive border and in case you think [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=277.44s)]
*  that that's some kind of unprecedented condition the reason the Cuban Missile [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=282.88s)]
*  Crisis happened is because the Cuban government after the failed Bay of Pigs [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=287.68s)]
*  operation 1961 to overthrow the Castro government which the CIA led and failed [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=292.56s)]
*  to accomplish wanted security against future US attempts to invade and engineer [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=297.76s)]
*  a coup and so they asked the Soviet Union will you put nuclear weapons in our [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=304.52000000000004s)]
*  country as protection against US invasions and the Soviet Union did had [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=307.56s)]
*  nuclear submarines around Cuba that was what the Cuban Missile Crisis was about [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=315.64s)]
*  the United States said we will absolutely not accept the presence of [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=319.56s)]
*  these weapons in a country 90 miles from our southern most border in Florida and [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=322.24s)]
*  not only did that almost lead to war it almost led to a nuclear war it came it [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=328.72s)]
*  was just a matter of luck that it didn't just to give you a sense for how [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=332.92s)]
*  dangerous these things can spiral so of course the Ukrainians don't want [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=336.16s)]
*  extremely threatening weapons because the Russians rather in Ukraine because [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=341.28000000000003s)]
*  of what is happening now namely that they now have very sophisticated long [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=345.8s)]
*  range missiles that they're now given they've been given the green light to [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=349.84s)]
*  shoot deep into mosque and into Russian territory and I assume those were [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=353.56s)]
*  negotiable those limits those limits are all over the place we obviously don't [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=359.44s)]
*  allow certain kinds of weapons to be in certain government countries where we [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=362.91999999999996s)]
*  feel threatened by it we do that all the time but the idea that she would sit [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=365.91999999999996s)]
*  there so smugly and be like yeah we did we they asked our advice they didn't ask [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=370.08s)]
*  her advice they knew that they had to do what they were told by Washington in [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=375.88s)]
*  Britain because that's who was going to fund them and arm them and protect them [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=380.64s)]
*  they were there wasn't an equal relationship they had to do what they [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=385.71999999999997s)]
*  were told in the message from London and Washington if she's admitting while she [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=388.28s)]
*  smirks is like yeah we looked at this deal and we're like no you can't do that [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=391.4s)]
*  you're not thought your country go up in flames sorry this is not a deal we can [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=397.35999999999996s)]
*  accept there were no similar constraints on Russia Russia wasn't [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=401.4s)]
*  required to pull back Russia wasn't wasn't required to have a buffer zone [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=407.47999999999996s)]
*  from the Ukrainian border wasn't required to have the same constraints on [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=411.91999999999996s)]
*  its military facing Ukraine and so people inside Ukraine and people outside [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=415.96s)]
*  Ukraine started asking questions about whether this was a good deal and it was [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=424.28s)]
*  at that point that it that it fell apart it fell apart because people inside [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=427.96s)]
*  Ukraine the ones who were asking the advice also said people outside Ukraine [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=434.12s)]
*  meaning me the master of Ukraine she's gonna smirking over the fact that she [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=437.64s)]
*  sabotaged a peace deal that had it been permitted to go forward not only would [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=442.0s)]
*  have saved hundreds of billions dollars in American money which no one cares [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=447.28s)]
*  about keep pouring that into Raytheon and General Dynamics and Boeing that's [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=450.15999999999997s)]
*  what it's for but also would have saved hundreds of thousands of lives of both [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=453.4s)]
*  young Russian men and young Ukrainian men would have averted the complete [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=459.47999999999996s)]
*  destruction of Ukraine what will be the reconstruction of it through JP Morgan [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=463.35999999999996s)]
*  and BlackRock and a whole bunch of other Volta funds that will profiteer off it [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=469.32s)]
*  at the expense of the American taxpayer as usual she's proud of the fact that [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=473.44s)]
*  she intervened with Boris Johnson to veto any negotiations she wanted that [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=477.88s)]
*  war to go forward she desperately wanted it and they admit it now they say that [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=483.2s)]
*  look this is a great war for us we haven't had to sacrifice a single one of [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=488.12s)]
*  our soldiers are pretty one of our citizens we're just forcing Ukrainians to [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=491.44s)]
*  die and if they don't want to fight we're taking them at gunpoint we're [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=495.59999999999997s)]
*  putting them in prison we're threatening to execute them if they desert their [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=501.4s)]
*  only they're the only ones are dying so what's great for us and we get to weaken [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=505.48s)]
*  Russia at the same time even though Russia is not actually being weakened so [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=508.56s)]
*  this should forever end any doubt about this obviously truthful historical [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=512.72s)]
*  narrative that the reason why this war wasn't diplomatically resolved at the [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=517.04s)]
*  beginning was because Victoria Nuland and Boris Johnson vetoed it because they [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=520.84s)]
*  knew they weren't going to be the ones who suffered instead they were going to [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg2Rzturj4Q&t=524.64s)]
