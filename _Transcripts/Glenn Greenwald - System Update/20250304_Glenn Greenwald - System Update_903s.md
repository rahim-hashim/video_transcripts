# Repression in the West Bank EXPOSED in Oscar-Winning Documentary
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [March 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY)
*  Well, you know, yesterday, the film No Other Land, the documentary, the Israeli-Palestinian [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=0.0s)]
*  documentary, won Best Documentary at the Oscars. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=12.64s)]
*  And as the New York Times reported, this is a film that received no U.S. distribution [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=17.48s)]
*  rights, no major streaming platforms picked up the film, no major distributor. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=24.0s)]
*  It is shown at some small independent theaters that kind of individually took it up, but [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=29.4s)]
*  there's no major distribution. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=34.64s)]
*  And that's unlike all the other Oscar winners. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=35.64s)]
*  And according to the New York Times, this is typical for topical, controversial documentaries. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=39.2s)]
*  But you look into the recent history of political documentaries, whether they're about labor [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=45.56s)]
*  rights or even gender issues or the war in Ukraine or Russia, the last two winners of [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=49.959999999999994s)]
*  the Oscar for Best Documentary related to Russia. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=56.48s)]
*  These are all films that had major distribution that Netflix or Amazon and the major carrier, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=59.52s)]
*  major streamers picked up. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=63.6s)]
*  It seems to be a pattern that's applied to any film that is critical of Israeli human [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=65.64s)]
*  rights, of the Israeli treatment of Palestinians. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=71.28s)]
*  We've seen over a dozen films struggle to obtain distributors in the U.S. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=74.72s)]
*  Or even some films have been kicked off of Netflix and, you know, those license have [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=79.76s)]
*  not been renewed thanks to a very concerted, very organized pro-Israel pressure campaign [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=84.56s)]
*  that if you stream these films, if you show them in the U.S., you're going to be pressured [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=91.4s)]
*  or attacked by these interest groups. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=98.24000000000001s)]
*  And I wanted to talk to you a little bit about this because it's not necessarily, it's possible [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=101.6s)]
*  that there's a government role in this. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=105.46000000000001s)]
*  It's not clear if there is any. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=108.08s)]
*  It's simply kind of the sensor of a third party using intimidation, using criticism. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=110.04s)]
*  And it's effectively blocking American audiences from viewing these films. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=115.76s)]
*  I think that might change for no other land after this accolade in Hollywood. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=120.2s)]
*  But for the most part, we've seen many films fail to obtain distribution. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=127.28s)]
*  I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about this dynamic. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=131.32s)]
*  Sure. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=133.72s)]
*  I mean, so I always say there are like two components to there's censorship, like actual [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=134.72s)]
*  government censorship or even censorship, not necessarily from government, but universities. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=139.08s)]
*  And then there's cancel culture, which is different. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=143.68s)]
*  And it operates. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=146.8s)]
*  I think in many ways, cancel culture is a little bit more insidious. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=147.8s)]
*  It means it loses your you might lose your job if you say certain things. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=151.2s)]
*  It's not allowing people to hear the perspectives of Palestinians. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=155.36s)]
*  That's pressure campaigns in these types of situations to silence one set of voices. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=160.28s)]
*  And it works. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=167.16s)]
*  I think that Americans have kind of unequivocally, for the most part, supported Israel for many [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=168.48s)]
*  decades because they haven't heard the Palestinian perspective at all. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=172.32s)]
*  We hear constantly about the Israelis perspective, about the historical suffering of the Jews, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=175.68s)]
*  which, of course, I don't want to downplay. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=181.0s)]
*  But we don't hear this other side. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=183.16s)]
*  I know someone asked me really early on in covid why I why I was skeptical of the propaganda [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=186.24s)]
*  around it. And I said and it's true that I had I had [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=194.2s)]
*  been attuned to the fact that the US media is very good at propagandizing people because [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=198.16s)]
*  I was aware of what happens around the Palestine issue. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=202.96s)]
*  My father is from the West Bank. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=206.24s)]
*  And so I grew up hearing his stories and just very, very aware of how one sided the view [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=207.84s)]
*  that Americans heard it. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=213.48s)]
*  And there's a very good reason for this. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=214.72s)]
*  I think that if Americans knew the horrendous conditions the Palestinians suffered in the [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=215.96s)]
*  occupied territories and the West, sorry, and Gaza, they would not support it. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=220.6s)]
*  They wouldn't be OK with it. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=225.04s)]
*  I mean, just the occupation, the oppression, imprisonment without charges, killing children, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=226.07999999999998s)]
*  constantly strangling the economy, just overt racism, the lack of equal rights, more so [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=232.04s)]
*  in Gaza and the West Bank versus Israel than like Palestinians who live in Israel. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=240.88s)]
*  That's always twisted. That's another thing. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=246.95999999999998s)]
*  But I think the fact that it couldn't the film can find a distributor here is very indicative [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=250.39999999999998s)]
*  of this issue. And it's just been so successful, so successful. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=255.6s)]
*  And you're also deemed anti-Semitic if you say that because you're sort of saying there's [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=259.68s)]
*  this Jewish cabal that's making sure these voices can't be heard. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=265.15999999999997s)]
*  And that's not what I'm saying. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=270.6s)]
*  But there clearly is there clearly are orchestrated efforts to silence Palestinians voices. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=272.04s)]
*  That's right. And I think it really also brings attention to what's been happening in the [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=277.68s)]
*  West Bank. I think Americans generally do not. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=282.96s)]
*  Pay attention to the Israel-Palestine conflict, even though they see these figures of billions [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=285.64000000000004s)]
*  of dollars in foreign aid and military aid going to Israel. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=291.40000000000003s)]
*  They see kind of these episodic eruptions in violence. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=294.72s)]
*  They don't pay attention to the day to day, particularly in the West Bank. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=299.24s)]
*  And there's this kind of dichotomy between Gaza and the West Bank, where people conflate [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=303.24s)]
*  the two issues. They say, OK, well, Hamas engaged in October 7th. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=308.44s)]
*  So, of course, there's going to be repercussions on the Palestinian people, whether you agree [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=312.92s)]
*  or not. That's perhaps the mindset for a lot of Americans. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=318.04s)]
*  Many do not realize that Hamas is not in control of the West Bank, that the repression in [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=321.08000000000004s)]
*  the West Bank has been ongoing well before October 7th. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=327.24s)]
*  And in seeming retribution for October 7th, the repression has increased in the West [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=330.92s)]
*  Bank over the last year and a half. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=337.20000000000005s)]
*  I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about that and about your family's roots in [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=339.68s)]
*  the West Bank. Sure. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=342.79999999999995s)]
*  Yeah. So my dad grew up there. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=345.2s)]
*  He's from a village near Jenin. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=347.44s)]
*  It's actually closer to Nablus, but I think like Nablus didn't make for us go to girls [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=348.91999999999996s)]
*  named after Jenin. So he named me after Jenin. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=352.79999999999995s)]
*  But he so he was from a very small village. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=356.76s)]
*  It was actually founded by his grandfather. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=359.0s)]
*  Everyone who lived in the village was a very close blood relation. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=360.71999999999997s)]
*  He was grew up very, very poor. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=363.32s)]
*  And he was about 15 when the West Bank fell under Israeli occupation. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=365.44s)]
*  It had been Jordanian occupation. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=369.12s)]
*  And he said actually at first it was relatively benevolent and there were more economic [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=372.08s)]
*  opportunities. So they were happy. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=377.28s)]
*  They didn't hate Israel because they were Jewish. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=378.84s)]
*  They actually preferred it. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=381.36s)]
*  But then there were some violent attacks against Jewish people, and that resulted in more [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=383.12s)]
*  crackdowns and increasing security measures in the occupied West Bank. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=390.92s)]
*  So increasing oppression and what this means in the daily life of Palestinians, which I [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=395.24s)]
*  could go on about forever. But I mean, you have no rights whatsoever. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=400.24s)]
*  So you can be killed by an Israeli soldier and probably the soldier won't suffer any [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=403.24s)]
*  consequences or very minimal. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=408.12s)]
*  You can be imprisoned without charges for indefinitely. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=409.64s)]
*  Your property can be taken and it is all the time. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=414.0s)]
*  You can't travel easily. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=416.52000000000004s)]
*  You have to go through checkpoints. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=417.88s)]
*  That's a huge part of a lot of people to get to work or to visit family or to travel at [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=419.08s)]
*  all. They have to go through these checkpoints where they have to wait for many hours. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=425.28s)]
*  They can be searched. They can be strip searched. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=428.2s)]
*  They can be killed. Their property can be taken. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=429.88s)]
*  It's extremely humiliating. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=431.91999999999996s)]
*  And they just don't have any rights whatsoever. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=434.03999999999996s)]
*  So the life under the occupation is really brutal. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=437.24s)]
*  And my dad came to the United States for that reason. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=440.84s)]
*  He that was one reason he pursued an education so that he could come here. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=443.68s)]
*  And this has been going on since 1967 in the West Bank. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=449.12s)]
*  Before that, Palestinians in Israel proper were dispossessed. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=456.08s)]
*  But that's kind of another story. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=458.96s)]
*  So most Americans don't know about this. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=460.59999999999997s)]
*  Another issue is that very religious, typically very religious Jewish settlers have been [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=463.84s)]
*  coming in and taking the land. Actually, half of our family's land was taken for an Israeli [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=469.59999999999997s)]
*  settlement a couple of decades ago. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=474.0s)]
*  We can like you can point to the settlement and see it on the other mountain. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=476.36s)]
*  So they just take the land and there's nothing you can do about it. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=481.08s)]
*  And the Israeli government doesn't do anything about it. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=483.4s)]
*  Yeah, it's it's a brutal situation. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=487.24s)]
*  Yeah. And it seems like the repression has just been increasing. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=490.12s)]
*  What one thing that I you know, I struggle with, I'm kind of just as a journalist, as a [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=493.68s)]
*  spectator, as someone who's interested in these issues, is that, you know, I'm hoping for [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=498.96s)]
*  a positive outcome. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=504.32s)]
*  I want people to live in peace and to see each other's common humanity. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=505.52000000000004s)]
*  And one problem I see on both the right and the left is just incredibly dehumanizing [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=510.96000000000004s)]
*  rhetoric. You see this on the activist left, sometimes on college campuses and in the [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=516.6800000000001s)]
*  streets of these demonstrations where they kind of attempt to delegitimize all of Israel [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=522.9200000000001s)]
*  or claim that rather than a Jewish project, this is a this resembles white supremacy, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=527.9200000000001s)]
*  which is simply inaccurate. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=534.04s)]
*  You see you see some calls for violence, but really just kind of an angry disposition [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=536.8399999999999s)]
*  that I don't think it helps resolve the issue. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=542.4s)]
*  I mean, at the end of the day, you have neighbors living alongside each other in the West [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=544.52s)]
*  Bank and other parts of Israel that they just need to get along. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=548.7199999999999s)]
*  They need equal rights and rhetoric that kind of separates the two does not kind of get [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=551.9599999999999s)]
*  us onto that path. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=556.4399999999999s)]
*  And I'm interested in kind of the horseshoe theory of some of the critics of the film, No [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=557.7199999999999s)]
*  Other Land, because I've seen pro-Israel voices that are associated with the right or [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=562.48s)]
*  associated with the Israeli government say, you know, this is a disgusting film that's [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=566.6800000000001s)]
*  anti-Semitic. I'm totally erasing the fact that there were several Israeli filmmakers [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=571.08s)]
*  and Israeli journalists who helped create this film. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=577.04s)]
*  And on the American left, some on the far left saying, oh, you know, why are they these [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=579.64s)]
*  are collaborators working with the occupiers? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=584.8000000000001s)]
*  Why is it an Israeli filmmaker working with the Palestinian? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=586.76s)]
*  You know, it's kind of the same argument, but from different sides of the spectrum. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=589.88s)]
*  And I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about that. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=593.92s)]
*  Yeah, well, it's a it's an opportune moment because I spent the morning arguing on Twitter [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=595.64s)]
*  with some of the extreme pro-Palestine people who were criticizing, especially Yuval Abraham, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=599.68s)]
*  who was the Israeli, main Israeli director, and saying, you know, he had spoken at his [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=606.24s)]
*  speech, he had said something about October 7th and how Hamas had acted horribly, which it [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=613.4s)]
*  had because targeting of civilians is always wrong and we should all agree on that. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=617.4s)]
*  And they're like this novelist, for example, Susan Abdalhwala, who I think is from the [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=622.04s)]
*  Jenin area, she wrote something like this wasn't even this wasn't Yuval's film. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=627.76s)]
*  This is all just, you know, he's like I don't I forgot what the term was, but he's just [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=633.5600000000001s)]
*  part of the colonial project. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=640.28s)]
*  This was Basel. Basel is the Palestinian. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=641.96s)]
*  This was really Basel's film. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=644.52s)]
*  So congrats to Basel. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=645.92s)]
*  And Yuval was welcomed by Basel's family, but he deserves no credit. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=647.16s)]
*  And I'm just like, what is this? This is so cruel and nasty and petty. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=651.12s)]
*  How are we? I mean, we have to work together. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=654.8s)]
*  We the people who want peace on both sides of this have to come together and find their [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=657.9599999999999s)]
*  common humanity. I don't think that's like a silly, naive point of view. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=661.92s)]
*  Why are we going to I mean, you either just keep killing each other, which is what's [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=666.8399999999999s)]
*  happening now, or we start to find ways to work together and live in peace. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=669.68s)]
*  And I thought also just being angry about the film, getting recognition at the Oscars [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=675.0s)]
*  or complaining about it for this reason, because Yuval was part of it, I think is also [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=680.44s)]
*  silly. I mean, it's a huge moment for Palestinian suffering to get two or three or four [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=686.12s)]
*  moments at the Oscars of airtime. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=691.36s)]
*  This is how fringe, quote unquote, fringe ideas become mainstream is through these kind [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=693.56s)]
*  of cultural institutions. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=699.04s)]
*  And for I think Conan O'Brien said a billion people were watching, maybe a billion people [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=701.64s)]
*  heard about this, a lot of whom probably know nothing about the Palestinian side of the [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=706.5999999999999s)]
*  story. That's huge. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=710.28s)]
*  So, I mean, I was kind of frustrated with these people. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=712.3199999999999s)]
*  And I think it also I think it's actually very unhelpful. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=714.3199999999999s)]
*  Like it turns people off. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=717.8399999999999s)]
*  It makes Palestinians look like extremists. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=719.16s)]
*  It makes them look like they're not willing to work with other people. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=721.4s)]
*  So, I mean, right now, their babies being starved to death in Gaza. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=724.12s)]
*  Like, let's stop that. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=727.68s)]
*  That's what that's what needs to stop. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=730.76s)]
*  Yeah. It reflects perhaps a pathology on the left that is maybe motivated by some type [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=733.0s)]
*  of anti-authoritarian vibe, but it actually in effect, it is self-austricizing. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=739.92s)]
*  They prefer to be an underground movement. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=746.56s)]
*  They prefer to be on the fringes. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=748.3199999999999s)]
*  So when they gain when their causes gain mainstream recognition, they almost act with [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=750.04s)]
*  disgust because anything mainstream or corporate is seen as an anathema to them. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=754.5600000000001s)]
*  So it's a very unhelpful dynamic because it really distances the actual cause of [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=760.96s)]
*  helping Israelis and Palestinians find common ground and end this conflict. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=768.04s)]
*  If you have activists that just are reflexive in terms of hating any type of mainstream [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=773.08s)]
*  coverage or recognition. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=779.24s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, and this like the reality of the situation is that most of the people we [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=781.0799999999999s)]
*  have in Congress don't even see Palestinians as human. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=786.0799999999999s)]
*  I mean, they've sneered at the idea of their suffering for 16 months when there were [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=788.8s)]
*  reports, I'm sure, you know, about 65 health care workers in Gaza said that they were [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=794.8s)]
*  seeing a pattern of children shot in the head, which made it make it clear that IDF [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=799.84s)]
*  soldiers were targeting children and purposely executing them, which is really shocking. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=806.1999999999999s)]
*  And it contradicts Israel's claim that any civilian deaths are accidental. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=810.04s)]
*  You can also see from the mass cartage, they're not accidental. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=815.36s)]
*  But I think this really drives it home. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=817.8s)]
*  So they were those 65 health care workers testified in Congress and not a single senator [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=820.04s)]
*  showed up, not one. They couldn't be bothered. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=825.04s)]
*  If this was testimony about Israeli children being shot in the head by Hamas, you can you [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=827.92s)]
*  can bet every single senator would be there. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=833.08s)]
*  So, I mean, the dehumanization of Palestinians is so extreme and they're being killed [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=835.1999999999999s)]
*  right now. And right now, Benjamin Netanyahu just said that he was closing the border so [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=840.4399999999999s)]
*  that no aid would be let into Gaza. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=845.1999999999999s)]
*  This means this is going to harm lots of people who need food and medical care and other [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=846.8399999999999s)]
*  supplies. This is a moral emergency, not just a moral emergency. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=851.36s)]
*  This is an emergency. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=856.04s)]
*  And this needs to stop now. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=857.9599999999999s)]
*  And being nit picky because this isn't exactly how you think, which how how the film, you [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=859.44s)]
*  know, you would have wanted the film to just be Palestinian directors. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=867.6s)]
*  OK, let's argue about that in 10 years. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=870.08s)]
*  But not right now. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=872.12s)]
*  No, I think that's right. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSp5MGp3ZRY&t=875.36s)]
