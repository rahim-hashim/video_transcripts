# Prof. John Mearsheimer on Ukraine's Losses and NATO Escalations
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [May 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE)
*  Basically, from the very beginning of the war, you were saying that this war is so misguided [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=0.0s)]
*  for the West to be encouraging and fueling because there's simply no way that Ukraine [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=12.46s)]
*  can defeat a power as great as Russia. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=17.06s)]
*  The population difference alone, let alone all the other disadvantages with Ukraine, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=19.82s)]
*  even if it has NATO funding, made it almost certain that eventually Russia would win or [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=24.02s)]
*  at least never get expelled from Ukrainian territory, which is what the Americans and [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=29.68s)]
*  NATO defined as victory. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=34.12s)]
*  And at the time, very few other people were willing to say it, either because they didn't [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=36.2s)]
*  see it or believe it or because they were so scared of saying anything against Ukraine [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=39.64s)]
*  because of the media accusation that you are a Kremlin apologist or propagandist or whatever. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=43.84s)]
*  I think everybody now acknowledges that you've been vindicated in this. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=49.0s)]
*  Even the Western media is now admitting that the Ukrainian war effort is on the verge of [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=52.1s)]
*  collapse. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=57.92s)]
*  Russians are advancing in all sorts of ways. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=59.0s)]
*  There's all kinds of challenges and problems that Ukraine faces just in terms of the battlefield [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=62.160000000000004s)]
*  itself, the war itself. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=67.64s)]
*  What do you now make of that? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=70.52s)]
*  I think your description is apt. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=73.68s)]
*  I think that the balance of power has shifted over the past two years. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=75.84s)]
*  The Ukrainians looked like they were doing quite well in 2022. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=81.36s)]
*  Remember, the war started in February of 2022. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=85.16000000000001s)]
*  And for the rest of that year, the Ukrainians looked like they were on a roll. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=89.0s)]
*  And we thought at the time that sanctions were going to work and we thought that we could [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=94.32000000000001s)]
*  defeat the Russians. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=98.68s)]
*  But the Russians mobilized their forces in late 2022. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=99.92s)]
*  And over the course of 2023, the balance of power shifted and it's now shifted much [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=103.92s)]
*  more in 2024. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=111.0s)]
*  So the Russians have a significant advantage in manpower. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=113.48s)]
*  I would guess they have a two to one advantage in manpower. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=118.12s)]
*  And furthermore, the Ukrainian forces are worn out. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=121.67999999999999s)]
*  They get very little rest and relaxation. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=126.2s)]
*  They don't get pulled off the front lines and get a chance to recharge their batteries. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=128.64s)]
*  The average age of a Ukrainian soldier is said to be 43 years old. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=133.96s)]
*  This is an army when you look at its manpower levels and the quality of the manpower is [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=139.16s)]
*  in really deep trouble. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=144.16s)]
*  Then when you look at the weaponry on both sides, the Russians probably have about a [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=146.32s)]
*  10 to one advantage in artillery. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=151.72s)]
*  The Ukrainians are forming new brigades. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=154.96s)]
*  And instead of forming armored brigades or mechanized brigades, they're forming pure [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=158.84s)]
*  infantry brigades because they don't have enough tanks and armored vehicles to create [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=165.12s)]
*  mechanized or armored brigades. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=170.84s)]
*  The Russians, on the other hand, are pumping out tanks and artillery rounds and artillery [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=173.48000000000002s)]
*  pieces like crazy. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=178.44s)]
*  So the balance of weaponry is decisively in favor of the Russians and that balance is [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=180.24s)]
*  growing more and more favorable for the Russians. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=186.32000000000002s)]
*  And then the final factor regarding the battlefield has to do with air power. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=189.32000000000002s)]
*  What the Russians did is they had this huge inventory of dumb bombs. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=193.76s)]
*  These are bombs that don't come that close to hitting the target when you drop them. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=197.92s)]
*  But they created these little packages that you could put on the bomb, each bomb, that [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=203.23999999999998s)]
*  made it a smart bomb. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=208.76s)]
*  And in effect, what you could do with that bomb then is put it in the pickle barrel. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=211.07999999999998s)]
*  So the Russians have these big bombs that they're dropping from the sky because the [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=215.88s)]
*  Russians control the air. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=220.07999999999998s)]
*  And these bombs are deadly effective. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=222.8s)]
*  They're big and they're accurate. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=225.16s)]
*  So when you marry all these things together, the balance of manpower, the balance of weaponry [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=227.44s)]
*  on the ground, and the balance of air power, it's clear that the Ukrainians are doomed. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=231.88s)]
*  So one of the... [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=238.08s)]
*  And this is my last question for you just because actually I have a lot more questions [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=239.08s)]
*  for you, but just in the respecting our time, yours and the show's, I'll just ask one more, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=242.36s)]
*  which is one of the consistent themes you have voiced since the beginning, and I remember, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=248.4s)]
*  I think I've asked you this every time you've been on, is the US and NATO set a definition [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=254.68s)]
*  of victory that seemed almost impossible to achieve, which was we're going to expel the [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=260.72s)]
*  Russians from every inch of Ukrainian territory, including Crimea. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=266.88s)]
*  And so anything short of that, the Russians keeping Crimea, the Russians occupying any [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=272.68s)]
*  part of the eastern provinces of Ukraine, would automatically be defined as a defeat [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=278.56s)]
*  of NATO and the US by Russia, something that is a humiliation that NATO and the United [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=283.94s)]
*  States, I think, will do everything to avoid. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=289.62s)]
*  So that brings us to this kind of escalatory language we're now hearing, not just President [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=293.08s)]
*  Macron's musing about the possibility of deploying NATO troops and having them fight [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=298.44s)]
*  directly alongside the Ukrainians against Russia, which would be World War III, but [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=302.88s)]
*  also there's a lot of pressure on Biden, and he's now doing it in part to lift the restriction [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=307.04s)]
*  that has been on the use of American weapons since the beginning of the war, that American [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=312.76s)]
*  weapons cannot be used to bomb inside Russia, to bomb targets inside of Russia. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=317.0s)]
*  Do you think that, is there any scenario in which the US or NATO will accept defeat [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=323.24s)]
*  as they defined it, or will they do increasingly escalatory things to try and prevent it? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=330.12s)]
*  What is the danger here? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=335.24s)]
*  Well I think your description of how we painted ourselves into a corner is correct, and we [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=338.6s)]
*  show no evidence of backing off. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=346.40000000000003s)]
*  The really smart thing for us to do at this point in time, not only from our own point [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=350.20000000000005s)]
*  of view, but from Ukraine's point of view and Ukraine's best interest, would be to try [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=355.64000000000004s)]
*  to negotiate some sort of settlement right now, before more Ukrainians die and before [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=361.0s)]
*  they lose more territory. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=366.6s)]
*  But if you look at what we're doing, we're going in exactly the opposite direction as [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=368.22s)]
*  you described it. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=371.88000000000005s)]
*  So the question is, what are we going to do as the situation on the battlefield continues [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=373.94s)]
*  to deteriorate? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=379.62s)]
*  It's now clear that we've basically have given the Ukrainians a green light to hit Russian [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=381.26s)]
*  territory, the Russian homeland, with these missiles like the Atacams missile that we've [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=388.06s)]
*  given to the Ukrainians. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=394.3s)]
*  I actually think the Russians will counter those missiles, and I think it will end up [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=396.94s)]
*  not being that big a deal. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=403.26s)]
*  But I may be wrong, and if I'm wrong, the Russians have made it clear, Putin has recently [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=405.34s)]
*  made it clear, that the retaliation from Russia will be significant. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=410.58s)]
*  And who knows what that means? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=416.94s)]
*  It could mean that the Russians will attack bases or storage sites in Poland or somewhere [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=418.8s)]
*  in the Baltic states, who knows for sure. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=426.58s)]
*  But the Russians will play hardball if those Atacams missiles and scout missiles that [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=429.48s)]
*  they get from the French are really having an effect. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=435.76s)]
*  So I'm actually hoping that those missiles don't work so we don't have escalation. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=439.6s)]
*  But it's hard for me to see where this one all ends, given that we're committed to winning [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=444.84s)]
*  and the Russians are winning, which means we're losing. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=451.64s)]
*  I would imagine that at some point we're going to get a frozen conflict, right? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=455.76000000000005s)]
*  That's what's going to happen. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=460.56s)]
*  It's going to look like the 38th parallel on the Korean Peninsula. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=461.56s)]
*  But even if you get a frozen conflict, Glenn, I think both sides will continue to go after [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=465.96000000000004s)]
*  each other, not in terms of a hot war, but in terms of looking for opportunities to undermine [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=472.12s)]
*  each other's position. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=478.72s)]
*  The Ukrainians and the Americans will go to great lengths to cause the Russians problems [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=480.64s)]
*  in those areas of Ukraine that they annex to Russia. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=486.32s)]
*  And the Russians will go to great lengths to sow dissension in Europe and to cause trouble [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=490.15999999999997s)]
*  in terms of transatlantic relations. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=494.8s)]
*  So I think as far as Europe is concerned, you see nothing, you can see nothing but trouble [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=497.58s)]
*  for as far as the eye can see. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=504.94s)]
*  All of this tells me that that decision on April 8th to bring Ukraine into NATO was really [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=507.6s)]
*  a catastrophic decision. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=514.52s)]
*  The consequences of that, the negative consequences of that, cannot be underestimated. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=516.44s)]
*  If that decision had not been made and Ukraine had not moved to become a member of NATO, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=522.44s)]
*  it had remained a neutral state, Ukraine would be intact today and we wouldn't be talking [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=529.24s)]
*  about a possible escalation involving a great power war. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=535.48s)]
*  We wouldn't even be talking about a war in Ukraine. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=540.74s)]
*  We made a catastrophic decision and the Americans are principally responsible. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=543.6800000000001s)]
*  And in fact, it was the Bush administration that is principally responsible for this disastrous [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=548.96s)]
*  decision. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=554.64s)]
*  Professor Mayor Shimer, it is always a pleasure to have you on the show, even though oftentimes, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=555.64s)]
*  maybe almost always, the message is not necessarily uplifting. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=561.4s)]
*  I'm thrilled that you've developed this sort of rock star status online where more and [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=565.2s)]
*  more people are hearing you. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhBDG-aXEE&t=569.64s)]
