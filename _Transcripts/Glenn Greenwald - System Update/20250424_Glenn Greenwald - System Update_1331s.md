# What Happened to the Epstein Files?
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [April 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI)
*  Remember the Epstein files? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=0.0s)]
*  The Epstein files, those are the things that Donald Trump spent 2024 promising to release. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=9.6s)]
*  And those are the files that were supposedly released back in February when Pam Bondi invited [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=16.52s)]
*  a bunch of right-wing influencers to the White House and handing them big, flamboyant notebooks [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=24.64s)]
*  that sent them Epstein files and they were all smiling, thinking that they had an exclusive [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=30.6s)]
*  on all this good stuff that was for the first time going to be publicly revealed. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=35.64s)]
*  And as it turned out, the whole thing was a sham. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=40.32s)]
*  All these documents had been long ago made public in a whole variety of ways through [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=42.08s)]
*  various litigations and FOIA requests on the part of media outlets. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=47.36s)]
*  There was absolutely nothing new in any of them. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=50.16s)]
*  And here is Pam Bondi talking about that on Fox News on February 21st, 2025, which is [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=53.4s)]
*  basically two full months ago now. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=60.64s)]
*  Oh, Jay may be releasing the list of Jeffrey Epstein's clients. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=62.8s)]
*  Will that really happen? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=67.2s)]
*  It's sitting on my desk right now to review. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=69.2s)]
*  That's been a directive by President Trump. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=72.36s)]
*  I'm reviewing that. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=74.52s)]
*  I'm reviewing JFK files, MLK files. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=75.52s)]
*  That's all in the process of being reviewed because that was done at the directive of [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=78.8s)]
*  the president from all of these agencies. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=82.0s)]
*  So have you seen anything there? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=83.84s)]
*  You said, oh, my gosh. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=85.44s)]
*  Not yet. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=88.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=90.08s)]
*  Now, the whole issue of the client list and the like, I understand why that gets people [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=91.52s)]
*  interested and excited. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=97.76s)]
*  But the reality is, is that we've already seen so much evidence of the people with whom [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=99.68s)]
*  Jeffrey Epstein was cavorting. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=104.72s)]
*  People just of the highest status and wealth throughout the world that basically brought [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=107.2s)]
*  down Prince Andrew of the British royal family. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=115.44s)]
*  We know Bill Clinton and Donald Trump both had extensive relationships, social relationships [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  with Jeffrey Epstein, which doesn't mean that they were on his island or having sex with [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=122.4s)]
*  underage girls. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  But we know all the people who have been associated with Jeffrey Epstein for a long time. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=128.76s)]
*  There may be some client lists, although Pam Bondi says I haven't seen anything shocking [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=132.76s)]
*  so far. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=136.08s)]
*  But to me, that's not really the most interesting question just because of how much disclosure [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=137.24s)]
*  there's already been around who's been on those fights, who's been to the island. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=141.60000000000002s)]
*  We pretty much know the answers to all of those questions. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=145.72000000000003s)]
*  To me, the much more interesting question is the geopolitical one. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=149.52s)]
*  Obviously, when you have the most powerful people on the planet being put into compromising [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=153.4s)]
*  positions on Jeffrey Epstein's island, on his plane, in his mansion in Palm Beach, in [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=159.88s)]
*  his mansion in the middle of Manhattan, and we know that there's all kinds of tapes and [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=169.24s)]
*  recordings that have been made that gives enormous amounts of blackmail power over these [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=175.64s)]
*  people, the questions of whether foreign governments, whether intelligence agencies in our country [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=181.28s)]
*  or others, in some way exploited that information, helped arrange it. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=185.6s)]
*  There's always been a question of what was the real source of Jeffrey Epstein's massive [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=191.4s)]
*  wealth. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=196.64s)]
*  We're talking here about a kind of wealth that is a multi-billionaire wealth. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=197.64s)]
*  He wasn't just somebody who was extremely wealthy. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=202.84s)]
*  There were zillions of people like those. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=204.48s)]
*  There were all sorts of ways to become wealthy on that level. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=206.0s)]
*  We're talking about somebody who had just the kind of wealth that only billionaires [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=208.79999999999998s)]
*  have, constant flying jets, massive jets that were private that he took everywhere, 80 to [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=214.28s)]
*  $100 million properties all over the world, the ability to purchase a private island, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=224.56s)]
*  to donate massive sums of money, to gain entrance into all sorts of... [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=230.84s)]
*  Where did that money come from? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=234.52s)]
*  Nobody really has ever been able to answer that. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=236.60000000000002s)]
*  We know a couple of things, including his relationship with somebody named Les Wexler, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=238.66s)]
*  who himself is a multi-billionaire with whom Jeffrey Epstein worked. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=243.02s)]
*  But there's no real expertise, identifiable expertise that Jeffrey Epstein had. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=248.54000000000002s)]
*  He never did anything on Wall Street that was particularly impressive. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=253.02s)]
*  And the question has always been, was there some government, some intelligence agency [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=257.14s)]
*  behind him with whom he was working or for whom he was working to create essentially [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=260.58s)]
*  a honey trap that would give these intelligence agencies knowledge of and therefore power [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=265.02s)]
*  over what a lot of people were doing? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=269.7s)]
*  That to me is the answer that we don't have any resolution on. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=271.5s)]
*  Maybe the answer to that is no. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=276.98s)]
*  But we really haven't had any sort of documentation providing guidance on that one way or the [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=279.4s)]
*  other. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=285.96s)]
*  And we know for certain that these files are in the custody of the US government, which [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=286.96s)]
*  is repeatedly promised to release them, pretended to release them back in February, although [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=291.8s)]
*  they didn't. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=296.14s)]
*  And the question is, where are the answers to that question? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=298.9s)]
*  When will we get the answers to that question, if ever? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=302.97999999999996s)]
*  And what we're being told right now is that the reason we can't have them is because there's [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=307.41999999999996s)]
*  a lot of redactions that need to take place for national security purposes. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=310.73999999999995s)]
*  I understand that some of these files would need to be redacted before released. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=316.02s)]
*  You don't want to release the names, for example, of victims who haven't been identified, who [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=319.09999999999997s)]
*  don't want to be identified, of some of the girls who were sex trafficked. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=322.5s)]
*  That'll make sense. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=325.94s)]
*  And perhaps you don't even want to release the names of the people who were Jeffrey Epstein [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=329.06s)]
*  associates, but where you have no evidence they engaged in any wrongdoing because that [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=332.3s)]
*  can harm their reputation. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=336.42s)]
*  I understand that as well. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=337.66s)]
*  But why would there be national security redactions unless Jeffrey Epstein had relationships with [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=340.62s)]
*  foreign governments? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=347.46000000000004s)]
*  And if Jeffrey Epstein had relationships with foreign governments, it seems like we could [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=349.58s)]
*  probably narrow down, which are the most likely. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=352.54s)]
*  And that leads me to the question of whether or not it's really possible that if those [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=356.40000000000003s)]
*  answers exist within the files of the US government under the Trump administration, whether we [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=361.76s)]
*  will ever actually see those at all. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=365.76s)]
*  And at the very least, we ought to keep up the pressure. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=369.52000000000004s)]
*  Here was the Department of Justice, the Public Affairs Division on February 27th of this [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=372.44s)]
*  year with the title, Attorney General Pam Bondi Releases First Phase of Declassified [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=376.64s)]
*  Epstein Files. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=382.92s)]
*  And that was when it turned out that they made a big fanfare out of, oh look, we're [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=385.16s)]
*  fulfilling our promise, you're getting the Epstein files. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=388.08000000000004s)]
*  They invited these Twitter influencers to the White House, here's Rogan O'Hanley, and [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=392.16s)]
*  they posted pictures of themselves. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=397.88000000000005s)]
*  There they are. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=399.44000000000005s)]
*  I think that's Taya Ryak, the proprietor of Libs of TikTok, walking out with their binders. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=400.44000000000005s)]
*  The binders said, Epstein files. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=407.12s)]
*  They showed them to the public. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=410.76000000000005s)]
*  So you see, it's like the Epstein files. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=411.76000000000005s)]
*  Look, we got the Epstein files. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=413.32000000000005s)]
*  We're so happy. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=414.84s)]
*  We're so smiley. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=415.84s)]
*  We're celebrating. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=416.84s)]
*  We're finally going to get the answers. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=417.84s)]
*  Look, they're giving it to independent media. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=418.84s)]
*  We're right outside the White House. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=420.52s)]
*  And there you see the closeup, the Epstein files, phase one. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=422.35999999999996s)]
*  And it turned out these documents were an absolute joke, not a single page that was [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=427.28s)]
*  in them that was previously unseen. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=433.2s)]
*  Now, Trump has been asked about this on a couple of occasions, including on April 22nd, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=439.68s)]
*  which was yesterday. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=446.16s)]
*  He was in the Oval Office and he was asked, hey, what about those Epstein files? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=447.16s)]
*  And here's what he said. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=451.68s)]
*  Which documents? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=453.56s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=456.56s)]
*  I'll speak to the attorney general about that. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=461.36s)]
*  I really don't know. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=463.96s)]
*  I know that we've done the RFK. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=465.44s)]
*  The Kennedy Martin Luther King is out there very shortly. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=468.59999999999997s)]

*  this is dispositive. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=1082.18s)]
*  What's dispositive are the records in the possession of the Trump administration. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=1083.98s)]
*  And what concerns me aside from how long it's taking is the fact that we're being told that [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=1089.74s)]
*  there has to be redactions made for national security. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=1094.74s)]
*  And for me, if there's some secret client list that we haven't seen before that contains [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=1100.14s)]
*  a bunch of names of people who had sex with Jeffrey Epstein's girls, of course, I guess [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=1104.38s)]
*  we should see that, especially if it contains the names of powerful people. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=1111.1s)]
*  I don't think that's the sort of thing that has been concealed given all the litigation. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=1114.1799999999998s)]
*  But I do think what is substantive and what is very possibly out there in documentation [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=1121.5s)]
*  is the extent to which Jeffrey Epstein had ties to intelligence agencies, our own or [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=1126.78s)]
*  others, and to what extent these operations were part of those intelligence agencies. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=1133.06s)]
*  I guess I should say that I have some doubt, given everything we've seen in the Trump administration [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=1139.38s)]
*  about the first three months and the importance of Israel and the Gulf states and everything [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=1146.7s)]
*  that they're doing, that if such documents exist, they would actually ever see the light [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=1151.26s)]
*  of day. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=1156.74s)]
*  But given that people have basically stopped talking about the Epstein documents, we thought [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=1157.74s)]
*  it was time to remind people that they're still out there, that they have not been released, [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=1161.02s)]
*  that there was that fake showing of releasing them at the beginning of the administration [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=1165.38s)]
*  that resulted in nothing. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=1169.5s)]
*  And the only way to make sure that these documents get released and get released in a form that [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=1172.0200000000002s)]
*  is actually meaningful is to keep the pressure up. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=1176.38s)]
*  I know I talk about this sometimes, but it really is true that so many people I know [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=1187.1000000000001s)]
*  who as they get older start thinking that they've learned everything there is to learn. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=1192.78s)]
*  We even have that cliche that captures this sort of thinking, which is you can't teach [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=1197.3s)]
*  an old dog new tricks. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=1200.6599999999999s)]
*  I always try and convince people, and I've actually tried to learn myself and teach myself [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=1202.6999999999998s)]
*  and make sure I remember that actually your brain is always growing and is always capable [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=1208.46s)]
*  of learning new things. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=1212.34s)]
*  And it's not only possible but important to continue to do that for the health of your [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=1213.34s)]
*  brain, for the satisfaction that you get from continuing to expand your brain. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=1217.46s)]
*  There's so much out there, no matter how much you study, no matter how many places you've [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=1222.46s)]
*  been that you just don't know about that are really worth knowing. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-zU9jk8YI&t=1225.62s)]
