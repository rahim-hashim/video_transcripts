# Michael Tracey Confronts Members of Congress About What it Means to be "America First" at the RNC
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [July 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A)
*  Alright, Glory Glory Hallelujah. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=0.0s)]
*  Here we are back once again, night two, Republican National Convention, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=8.9s)]
*  and behold, bask in the glory of the Republican Convention. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=16.12s)]
*  I've never had a better time in my entire life. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=21.32s)]
*  Can't you see my glee and joy just radiating? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=23.7s)]
*  I know the camera woman can see it, but can you at home see it? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=29.76s)]
*  See, I'm breaking the fourth wall. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=32.4s)]
*  So what we're going to do again is just meander around, see who we bump into, you know the [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=38.24s)]
*  routine. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=43.92s)]
*  I usually can identify lots of obscure people who 99.9% of America would have no reason [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=47.040000000000006s)]
*  to ever be able to identify, but that's my burden. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=53.6s)]
*  Oh, so here's Sheriff Joe Arpaio, so we'll try him. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=56.96s)]
*  You know, it's a newfangled title that they gave to journalists for whatever reason in [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=79.6s)]
*  this day and age. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=84.64s)]
*  You are Sheriff Joe. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=88.88s)]
*  I thought you were Sheriff Joe. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=91.16s)]
*  How are you doing, sir? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=92.16s)]
*  I'm Michael Tracey. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=93.16s)]
*  Sheriff Joe, so you were one of the very original endorsers of Donald Trump in the 2016 cycle, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=94.16s)]
*  is that right? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=103.84s)]
*  Day one. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=104.84s)]
*  When the day came down the escalator? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=105.84s)]
*  Next day. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=109.56s)]
*  Next day. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=110.56s)]
*  First rally. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=111.56s)]
*  June 15th. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=113.48s)]
*  Something like that, right? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=114.48s)]
*  2015. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=115.48s)]
*  Went on a stage, nobody would do it. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=116.48s)]
*  I did. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=119.36s)]
*  I said three things. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=120.36s)]
*  There's a silent majority out there and everybody started screaming. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=122.88s)]
*  Then I said we're born on the same day, which we are. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=128.32s)]
*  June 14th? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=131.72s)]
*  Yeah, then I said you're going to be the next president. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=132.72s)]
*  I was right, but I've been with him forever. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=136.48000000000002s)]
*  So what went through your mind when the terrible incident happened on Saturday? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=140.44s)]
*  What was your first reaction? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=145.08s)]
*  Very sad. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=146.08s)]
*  Because a month before I was at his rally here, he called me on a stage. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=147.08s)]
*  The only one he called. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=154.24s)]
*  So I walked over and we hugged and kissed. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=155.92000000000002s)]
*  And then a month later they're trying to kill him? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=160.04000000000002s)]
*  Bad. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=164.84s)]
*  We've spoken to a few people who believe there was divine intervention at play that spared [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=166.84s)]
*  him the worst of the bullet. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=171.48s)]
*  Do you think there was something metaphysical going on or what's your belief? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=173.64000000000001s)]
*  I've escaped a lot of bad situations. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=179.6s)]
*  So someone upstairs is looking out for me. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=183.76s)]
*  So are you going to be running for office again? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=188.84s)]
*  You've run for office a few times recently. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=192.28s)]
*  Well, I'm running for my hometown mayor. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=194.8s)]
*  But you didn't win, right? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=197.84s)]
*  Recently. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=199.52s)]
*  No, okay, so I lost. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=200.52s)]
*  No, I'm just clarifying factually. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=202.44s)]
*  People, the federal judge, George Soros, everybody ganged up on me. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=204.6s)]
*  You could have won. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=208.88s)]
*  Anybody could. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=209.96s)]
*  What they did to me. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=211.32s)]
*  Are you going to run again? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=212.32s)]
*  I'm running for mayor. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=213.32s)]
*  Oh, you're running now? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=214.32s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=215.32s)]
*  All right, well, good luck. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=216.32s)]
*  I have more people in jail than in my town. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=217.32s)]
*  What's the population of the town? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=224.48s)]
*  I'm assuming you could secure Trump's endorsement if you sought it. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=225.95999999999998s)]
*  I don't ask for a door. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=233.0s)]
*  I don't ask for a door. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=235.4s)]
*  Would you accept it if offered? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=237.44s)]
*  He doesn't have to endorse me. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=240.12s)]
*  We all know our connection. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=242.51999999999998s)]
*  How about attorney general in the second Trump administration? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=243.92s)]
*  Do you interested? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=246.48s)]
*  Attorney general. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=249.4s)]
*  Attorney general of the United States. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=250.4s)]
*  First of all, I'm not a lawyer. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=251.4s)]
*  You're a sheriff. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=253.52s)]
*  You were a sheriff for many years. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=254.52s)]
*  You got to be a lawyer. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=256.72s)]
*  So I don't know my future. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=259.72s)]
*  I do know I never asked for a job. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=262.72s)]
*  All right, Sheriff Joe, thank you. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=265.72s)]
*  Another Sheriff Joe Arpaio. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=268.72s)]
*  Well-known figure in Arizona. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=271.72s)]
*  Controversial at times, fair to say. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=274.72s)]
*  I threw him some softball questions because I think he's about 90 years old now. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=277.72s)]
*  He's still running for office. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=282.92s)]
*  But maybe that's my bias. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=285.92s)]
*  Slide over that way. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=288.92s)]
*  Oh. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=291.92s)]
*  Oh, just made you slide over. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=292.92s)]
*  OK, let's proceed. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=299.92s)]
*  I'm a corrupt sister. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=302.92s)]
*  That I have been and my family has been. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=305.92s)]
*  He is committed to providing economic opportunities. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=308.92s)]
*  Helping those suffering from addiction with long-term, inpatient drug programs. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=313.92s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=320.92s)]
*  Get out. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=323.92s)]
*  Look at the photo they have up there. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=324.92s)]
*  That's pretty funny. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=333.92s)]
*  They have a strong focus on black Americans at this year's Republican Convention. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=336.92s)]
*  Which, you know, more power to them. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=345.92s)]
*  So there's a member of Congress who I don't recognize. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=348.92s)]
*  Who is that? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=353.92s)]
*  Andy Barr. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=356.92s)]
*  Andy Barr, right. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=357.92s)]
*  We have one second for a rumble stream. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=359.92s)]
*  OK, sure. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=368.92s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=369.92s)]
*  So what is your view on the... [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=370.92s)]
*  I wish I had the Congressional roll call in front of me. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=375.92s)]
*  The $24 billion Israel supplemental from April. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=379.92s)]
*  Were you a yes or a no on April? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=384.92s)]
*  I was a yes. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=386.92s)]
*  You were a yes. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=387.92s)]
*  Why? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=388.92s)]
*  Do you think there's any biblical or religious justification for US support for Israel? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=389.92s)]
*  Well, look, a strong Israel that is able to defend itself is not just in the interest [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=395.92s)]
*  of our greatest ally, democracy in the Middle East, Israel. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=403.92s)]
*  It is in the interest of the United States. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=406.92s)]
*  A strong Israel is a bulwark against terrorism in a very dangerous and difficult part of [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=409.92s)]
*  the world. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=416.92s)]
*  And they are a forward operating base for our fight against radical Islamic terrorism. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=417.92s)]
*  Do you see there being any tension between the America First point of view and also so [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=426.92s)]
*  stalwartly supporting Israel? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=431.92s)]
*  Well, it seems like there might be some tension there. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=433.92s)]
*  At least some conservatives have to complain about that. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=435.92s)]
*  If anyone is confused about that, let me set the record straight. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=437.92s)]
*  Being pro-Israel is America First. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=441.92s)]
*  Plain and simple. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=445.92s)]
*  And aside from the strategic imperatives around Israel being a bulwark for US interest, do [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=447.92s)]
*  you believe there to be any religious underpinning for the rationale there? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=453.92s)]
*  Explain. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=456.92s)]
*  Of course. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=457.92s)]
*  Look, as a Christian, I've been to Israel, the Holy Land, four times. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=458.92s)]
*  And in the Commonwealth of Kentucky, we do have a Jewish population that is, of course, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=461.92s)]
*  instinctively pro-Israel. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=467.92s)]
*  But the Christians of Kentucky understand that Israel is the biblical homeland of the [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=469.92s)]
*  Jewish people. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=478.92s)]
*  And it is our heritage as Christians as well. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=480.92s)]
*  And so it is extremely meaningful for the people of our country to hearken back to our [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=483.92s)]
*  Judeo-Christian heritage. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=489.92s)]
*  And remember that those who bless Israel are blessed by God. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=491.92s)]
*  And do you anticipate that Donald Trump will more faithfully execute your vision of the [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=497.92s)]
*  correct US policy vis-à-vis Israel? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=501.92s)]
*  Well, of course. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=503.92s)]
*  And as Nikki Haley said, you know, I form a rival to President Trump, it's pretty clear [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=505.92s)]
*  whose side Joe Biden's on. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=511.92s)]
*  Joe Biden is the one pushing back on our friends in Israel instead of pushing back [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=513.92s)]
*  on the enemy in Hamas. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=520.92s)]
*  Last thing I'll let you go, I saw you, there was an issue where you're trying to get some [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=522.92s)]
*  regulation, or I can't give you the full details, but involving Tennessee whiskey, sorry, Kentucky [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=525.92s)]
*  whiskey, is that right? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=531.92s)]
*  Kentucky bourbon. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=533.92s)]
*  Yeah, Kentucky bourbon, that's right. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=534.92s)]
*  What's the update on, explain what you're advocating and what progress there's been [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=535.92s)]
*  legislatively on that. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=539.92s)]
*  Here's the thing, it's a multi-billion dollar industry for the Commonwealth of Kentucky. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=541.92s)]
*  I'm the co-chairman of the Congressional Bourbon Caucus. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=545.92s)]
*  And let me just say this about Kentucky bourbon whiskey, it is the drink of freedom. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=551.92s)]
*  That I agree with. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=556.92s)]
*  There's bipartisan agreement there. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=558.92s)]
*  All right, thank you very much. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=560.92s)]
*  God bless Israel, God bless the United States. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=561.92s)]
*  All right, thanks Congressman. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=563.92s)]
*  There you go. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=564.92s)]
*  There's Congressman Andy Barr, Kentucky. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=565.92s)]
*  See, there's a couple, sometimes there's so many generic looking Republicans, I don't [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=568.92s)]
*  instantly recall their names, but I have to have somebody jog my memory, but I would have [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=573.92s)]
*  recalled, eventually that's Andy Barr. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=579.92s)]
*  Similarly with, so there's Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, definitely [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=581.92s)]
*  ozempic, pilled, which again, I don't judge, I probably should take it myself. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=591.92s)]
*  And while I was briefing the president, I'm the upcoming president. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=596.92s)]
*  I know, somebody's tapping me on the shoulder to do what, I don't know. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=600.92s)]
*  All of the kids attending that day, gathered in the Rose Garden, getting ready to meet [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=602.92s)]
*  him, and we were walking out onto that beautiful, perfect colony. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=608.92s)]
*  And I saw out of the corner of the room, I saw out of the corner of the room, was a woman [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=614.92s)]
*  who was directly acting as the president of the United States. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=619.92s)]
*  Congressman Mast, how are you? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=624.92s)]
*  Good, how about you? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=627.92s)]
*  You have two minutes for rumble? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=628.92s)]
*  Sure. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=629.92s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=630.92s)]
*  So, you caused a stir after October 7th, you came to the Capitol wearing your Israeli [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=631.92s)]
*  fatigues. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=639.92s)]
*  There was maybe a segment of people on the right, not a majority, but a segment who thought [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=640.92s)]
*  maybe that was inappropriate, or maybe it showed that you were placing maybe loyalty [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=644.92s)]
*  to one country over another. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=650.92s)]
*  Did you hear that criticism? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=652.92s)]
*  What did you make of it? [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=653.92s)]
*  Do you think any of it had any legitimacy? [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=655.92s)]
*  I don't think I've ever done anything where I haven't heard a criticism in life. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=656.92s)]
*  But I have two uniforms that I've worn. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=660.92s)]
*  I've worn the uniform of the United States military, obviously injured in Afghanistan [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=663.92s)]
*  in the uniform of the IDF. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=667.92s)]
*  And I say both of those things proudly. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=669.92s)]
*  That's it. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=671.92s)]
*  Do you think there's any conflict or tension between those? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=672.92s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=674.92s)]
*  I gave my legs for this country. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=675.92s)]
*  I love this country. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=677.92s)]
*  I'd give my left and right arm for this country. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=678.92s)]
*  There's nothing I love more than the United States of America. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=680.92s)]
*  And that's it. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=683.92s)]
*  You think Israel recently has codified into law the fact that it is a Jewish state, meaning [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=684.92s)]
*  it's the Jewish state, homeland for all Jews. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=690.92s)]
*  Now, of course, that had customarily been the purpose of Israel. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=692.92s)]
*  But it was only in the past couple of years that they formally codified that through the [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=694.92s)]
*  Knesset. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=698.92s)]
*  What do you make of that? [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=699.92s)]
*  I mean, did you think that there's anything... [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=702.92s)]
*  The United States could never say that we're the homeland for any particular ethnic group, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=704.92s)]
*  right? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=709.92s)]
*  So... [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=710.92s)]
*  Israel is the place to make sure that never again happens, all right? [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=711.92s)]
*  That that happens, that never again is the truth of the land, right? [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=714.92s)]
*  And I think it was John Kerry that tried during the Iran nuclear deal to say, well, you know, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=718.92s)]
*  Israel can be a democratic state or a Jewish state, but they can't get both. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=722.92s)]
*  Anybody that have that John Kerry attitude, F'em. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=726.92s)]
*  So, what do you think would be the main difference in a second Trump administration regarding [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=729.92s)]
*  Israel versus how the Biden administration has conducted policy? [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=735.92s)]
*  Would there be fewer constraints on Israel, for example, you know, getting all the weaponry [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=739.92s)]
*  it needs to continue bombarding Gaza or what would be... [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=742.92s)]
*  Donald Trump doesn't do things that don't make sense, right? [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=746.92s)]
*  Joe Biden does. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=748.92s)]
*  Joe Biden says, OK, listen, let's assist Israel militarily, who is our ally, but let's also [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=749.92s)]
*  assist our non-ally, who is at war with our ally. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=756.92s)]
*  Let's build them a pier for $300 million and then dismantle it. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=760.92s)]
*  Let's make sure that we put pressure on Israel to not finish the job of destroying the people [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=764.92s)]
*  that still currently hold Americans hostage. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=768.92s)]
*  There's a major difference between Trump foreign policy and Biden foreign policy. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=770.92s)]
*  And it's making sure that your yes is yes, your no is no, and that you back the people [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=775.92s)]
*  that have the back of the United States of America. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=778.92s)]
*  Now, do you think there's any tension between being America first, but also having such [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=780.92s)]
*  a stalwart support for Israel? [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=784.92s)]
*  I mean, are you therefore not putting America first or like kind of one in the same? [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=786.92s)]
*  Israel is America's largest aircraft carrier in the Middle East, hands down. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=789.92s)]
*  It's our biggest aircraft carrier. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=793.92s)]
*  Did you vote? [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=795.92s)]
*  I know you voted for the $26 billion in the national security supplemental for Israel in April. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=796.92s)]
*  Did you vote for the Ukraine portion? [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=801.92s)]
*  No. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=803.92s)]
*  You did not. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=804.92s)]
*  And what was your thinking there? [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=805.92s)]
*  I think one easy thing to point at is, you know, let's look at the makeup of the GDP of Europe [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=806.92s)]
*  versus the Middle East, right? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=812.92s)]
*  In Europe, you have the EU largely $20-plus trillion in GDP, America $25 trillion, and Ukraine [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=814.92s)]
*  maybe half a trillion dollars, Russia maybe $2 trillion. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=820.92s)]
*  You have all of that GDP in Europe that should have the back of the Ukraine to a greater extent [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=824.92s)]
*  than the United States of America. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=830.92s)]
*  In the Middle East, you have Israel with every other part of the GDP of the Middle East [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=832.92s)]
*  standing against them instead of standing behind them. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=838.92s)]
*  If you ask me, instead of Democrats pushing for a two-state solution, you should be looking for [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=841.92s)]
*  a 24-state solution where the 24 Arab states take in the individuals from Gaza instead of asking Israel to give up land. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=846.92s)]
*  So it wasn't that you objected on principle to the U.S. funding or arm in Ukraine. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=853.92s)]
*  You were objecting to the proportionality vis-a-vis Europe. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=856.92s)]
*  That's certainly one part of it. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=859.92s)]
*  The other part of it is absolutely no plan for victory there whatsoever. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=861.92s)]
*  Absolutely no plan for what America gets out of it to say, hey, Putin will be out of power [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=864.92s)]
*  or there will be Russian nuclear demilitarization because they've elevated their nuclear threat posture [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=870.92s)]
*  or there will be demilitarized zones along NATO and Russia borders or take your pick of things. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=875.92s)]
*  There is absolutely no objective. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=880.92s)]
*  We are supporting Ukraine to survive and not to win, and that can't be the way that our plan is. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=882.92s)]
*  So your critique mainly of the Biden administration has not been it's provided too much support to Ukraine. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=886.92s)]
*  But similar to Israel, it's imposed similar limitations on its ability to wage the war as it sees fit. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=892.92s)]
*  There's no plan of attack whatsoever when it comes to Ukraine, and there hasn't been for 900 days. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=898.92s)]
*  Where is Ukraine currently permitted to strike within territory or Russia? [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=903.92s)]
*  They never give us the parameters of that policy. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=907.92s)]
*  The first they said it was – [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=909.92s)]
*  That's another major problem that you're bringing up, right? [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=910.92s)]
*  If you want to fight, you fight to win. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=912.92s)]
*  And one of the ways that you fight to win is you move the battle off of your neighborhood and into their neighborhood. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=914.92s)]
*  And the fact that we're arming them but saying those weapons that we arm you with, you can't use them offensively into Russia proper. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=919.92s)]
*  That's another major problem of not supporting somebody that we're supposedly supporting to win. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=925.92s)]
*  You should make that comparison. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=930.92s)]
*  So Trump has been ridiculously attacked of being upon Putin and all this sort of nonsense. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=931.92s)]
*  But as he often points out himself, the Trump administration was very aggressive on Russia sanctions, you know, abrogating certain treaties and things. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=935.92s)]
*  Do you anticipate that in a second Trump administration there will be more of that resolved to support Ukraine or to take aggressive steps against Russia? [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=944.92s)]
*  There's a distinct benefit of President Trump knowing Vladimir Putin, just like there's distinct disadvantage of Vladimir Putin knowing Joe Biden. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=953.92s)]
*  What he knows about Donald Trump is that, again, his yes is yes, his no is no. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=961.92s)]
*  If he says he'll do it, he will do it, and Vladimir Putin will back up. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=965.92s)]
*  What he knows about Joe Biden is that he's affable. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=969.92s)]
*  There are no absolutes and he can run right over them. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=972.92s)]
*  But what would Trump actually do? [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=975.92s)]
*  I mean, he says he'll solve the war in 24 hours, but would that require giving territorial concessions to Russia? [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=977.92s)]
*  All he has to do is tell Vladimir Putin what will be the consequences of whatever he decides will be the- [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=982.92s)]
*  Nuclear? [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=989.92s)]
*  Whatever Donald Trump decides will be the red lines. These will be the consequences for that. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=990.92s)]
*  But don't voters deserve to know a little more detail? [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=994.92s)]
*  Putin will know that he is serious about- [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=996.92s)]
*  Right, but don't voters, I mean journalists, whomever, deserve to know a little bit more detail as to what those red lines would be or should it just be kept a secret until he's in power? [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=998.92s)]
*  No, I don't think you deserve to know what those red lines would be. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=1006.92s)]
*  All right, I'll accept that. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=1009.92s)]
*  Thanks, everyone. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=1011.92s)]
*  I thought we had until 10 o'clock. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=1017.92s)]
*  You have 20 minutes. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=1019.92s)]
*  I'm sorry, sir. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=1020.92s)]
*  Yeah, I just got my text. I gotta go. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=1021.92s)]
*  Okay. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=1024.92s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=1025.92s)]
*  We can walk back this way. If you spot another person, I'll fudge you to another five. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=1026.92s)]
*  Okay, thank you. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=1030.92s)]
*  Okay, so that was Congressman Brian Mast of Florida. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=1031.92s)]
*  I'm pretty sure that, I hope that was Brian Mast, or else I flubbed his name. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=1034.92s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, we are not home to stand still in the face of great danger. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=1040.92s)]
*  That's another, that's another congressman whose name escapes me, but we're going to keep going. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=1047.92s)]
*  We're going to make our way through here. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=1051.92s)]
*  We do not know what the future holds. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=1054.92s)]
*  Let's see if we spot anybody else. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=1056.92s)]
*  Let's see. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=1058.92s)]
*  See, I feel like yesterday we had more wiggle room with our timing, but perhaps not. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=1059.92s)]
*  Maybe I'm looking through, yes, looking at yesterday through rose colored glasses. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=1065.92s)]
*  We're going to make our way slowly, see if we spot anybody else. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=1070.92s)]
*  I should have studied the congressional directory. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=1077.92s)]
*  To make sure that. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=1082.92s)]
*  We will show the world that if we are against the place where freedom reigns and it is not [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=1087.92s)]
*  a place where we are not going to be able to do anything, we will be able to do anything. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=1094.92s)]
*  We will show the world that if we are against the place where freedom reigns and liberty will never die. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=1102.92s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=1117.92s)]
*  Let's get some USA, good old USA from the floor of the Republican convention. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=1127.92s)]
*  2024 Milwaukee. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=1131.92s)]
*  If you're watching at home, why not stand up and bellow a few USAs. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=1133.92s)]
*  Maybe it'll give you some emotional release, maybe some pent up frustrations that you're letting out. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=1137.92s)]
*  I'll join you. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=1142.92s)]
*  Just excited about a great few days. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=1143.92s)]
*  But let us leave here energized and committed to making sure that we protect our freedom [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=1146.92s)]
*  and we have the ability to pass it on to the next generation because America is the greatest country that the world has ever known. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=1152.92s)]
*  OK, so here we are being thrown out. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=1160.92s)]
*  But hey, I did what I could. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=1165.92s)]
*  I did more than you deserve, viewer. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=1169.92s)]
*  All right, so we'll leave it there for now and we'll be back hopefully God willing tomorrow. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=1171.92s)]
*  And yada yada yada. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=1187.92s)]
*  God bless America. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgezF16I-A&t=1190.92s)]
