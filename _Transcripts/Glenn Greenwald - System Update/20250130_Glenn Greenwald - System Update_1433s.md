# Warmongering Think Tanks EXPOSED with Researcher Nick Cleveland-Stout
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [January 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA)
*  One of the primary themes of my reporting over the years is that there's a part of the federal government that really should not exist. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=0.0s)]
*  It's not really there as part of our democratic accountability. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=12.1s)]
*  It's an invisible permanent power faction in Washington that exerts enormous influence, even though they really are not supposed to be within the policy making part of our government. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=15.16s)]
*  That's the U.S. security state. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=25.34s)]
*  There's a similar framework, a similar faction in Washington that on some level exercises influence like that, even in a more opaque and sinister way. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=26.7s)]
*  And that is the network of institutions that are referred to as Washington think tanks, which play a far greater public role in shaping U.S. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=35.9s)]
*  policy, especially foreign policy, than most people realize. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=44.58s)]
*  And there are a lot of questions surrounding their funding sources and how those funding sources exist to shape their influence that they have over policy making. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=47.86s)]
*  There are a lot of reasons why Washington stays on permanent power footing. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=59.42s)]
*  And one of the major reasons is because there are so many think tanks in Washington that are there for that reason who get funding in order to influence them. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=63.980000000000004s)]
*  That funding is often very sketchy and unknown. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=71.26s)]
*  And Nick is a member of the U.S. policy unit of the Quincy Institute. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=77.86s)]
*  He has conducted a lot of research on U.S.-Brazil relations as a 2023 Fulbright fellow with a particular focus on the influence of American think tanks in Brazil. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=81.06s)]
*  And he has also produced very interesting and important reports on exactly who is behind the most influential think tanks in D.C. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=90.1s)]
*  and how that funding shapes their influence over our government. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=96.53999999999999s)]
*  And he is with us tonight to talk about that. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=99.3s)]
*  Nick, it is great to see you. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=101.66s)]
*  I'm very excited to delve into the important work you've been doing. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=102.66s)]
*  Thanks for joining us tonight. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=105.38s)]
*  Absolutely. So before we get into the actual work you're doing on think tanks, you are doing this work as part of the Quincy Institute. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=107.86s)]
*  Can you tell us what the Quincy Institute is and what it's really devoted to doing? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=114.7s)]
*  Yes, so the Quincy Institute is also a think tank. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=121.38s)]
*  We were we are sort of an anti-war think tank, you know, always looking for the next endless war to end. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=124.38s)]
*  And kind of our our focus within the democratizing foreign policy program is on exposing some of the special interests that play a role in militarizing our foreign policy, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=133.26s)]
*  you know, looking at conflicts of interest, looking at the role of lobbying, looking at the role of campaign contributions, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=143.73999999999998s)]
*  kind of that under the hood look at the role of money in foreign policy. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=150.73999999999998s)]
*  So generally people understand why it's important to know the funding sources of a influential institution. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=156.14s)]
*  But a lot of times I think it's not always incredibly helpful in terms of assessing the role that that institution plays. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=164.85999999999999s)]
*  For example, there's a lot of times a mismatch between, say, funding for a media outlet and what the role of the media outlet is actually there to do. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=173.34s)]
*  I know, for example, when I was at the Intercept and we were funded by the billionaire PR Midiar, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=179.85999999999999s)]
*  oftentimes the things he was saying were the exact opposite of the things we were doing. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=184.02s)]
*  The causes that he was supporting were ones we were working against. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=188.34s)]
*  But obviously it's something that ought to be known so that people can make their own assessments. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=191.42000000000002s)]
*  And of course, it has an influence. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=194.70000000000002s)]
*  Why do you think it's so important to do this work and for people to know the funding sources of think tanks? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=196.42000000000002s)]
*  I think it's important because it is hardly talked about in Washington. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=202.46s)]
*  I think when you think of other issue areas in domestic policy, people are aware of these sorts of conflicts of interests. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=207.42s)]
*  But think tanks are sort of the wild west in that when we made this database, which I very much encourage anyone, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=215.78s)]
*  and if you're listening, check out thinktankfundingtracker.org largely with journalists in mind. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=223.7s)]
*  We want members of the media to be better, good faith journalists to be better at disclosing these sorts of conflicts of interest, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=229.38s)]
*  because think tank experts are the people that you see on TV, that are quoted in interviews, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=238.18s)]
*  that are testifying in front of Congress, serving on congressional commissions. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=244.7s)]
*  So they have this immense amount of influence over the policy process, but rarely do these conflicts of interests get called out [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=249.9s)]
*  because they very much present themselves as these independent, objective actors. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=257.74s)]
*  Most think tanks will have some form of academic independence policy in which they say, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=265.42s)]
*  donors don't have an influence over our policy. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=274.78000000000003s)]
*  We come to our own conclusions and a specific position that an expert takes does not reflect necessarily the view of the institution. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=276.94s)]
*  But the truth is that the donors do have influence, at the very least in the case of self-censorship. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=288.42s)]
*  Most think tanks, though, do even go a step beyond that, looking at they have these programs called corporate sponsorship programs, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=298.22s)]
*  which are essentially pay to play research. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=307.22s)]
*  They will say you get access to the think tanks, resources, experts, context that they have on the Hill, receptions, all sorts of different things, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=310.5s)]
*  even in some cases being allowed to make recommendations for research areas. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=323.26s)]
*  And so it's important to understand the way in which these relationships are influencing our foreign policy, because that's step one. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=330.1s)]
*  We don't even have that. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=339.09999999999997s)]
*  You know, one of the things I remember being actually shocked by when I was probably still in a state of naiveté when I started really doing political journalism [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=341.17999999999995s)]
*  was how often it would be that people who were quoted in news articles as experts or people who appeared on television to analyze events [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=348.5s)]
*  or people who testified before Congress were getting paid by clients, lobbying clients or consulting clients [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=357.41999999999996s)]
*  who had a very obvious and clear investment in the policy debates in which they were participating or the things on which they were commenting as experts. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=365.18s)]
*  And none of it would ever be disclosed. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=373.74s)]
*  In fact, it's a very common practice to this very day. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=375.38s)]
*  If you go and look at newspaper articles that are being cited, that are citing some sort of an expert at a think tank or just some floating experts, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=377.90000000000003s)]
*  so often they're paid by people who have very vested interest for them to give exactly the analysis that they're providing with no disclosure of any kind. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=385.66s)]
*  And for whatever reason, nobody thinks there's anything wrong with that journalistically. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=394.02000000000004s)]
*  Let's look at a little bit of concrete examples. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=397.34000000000003s)]
*  I think we have and we're going to link to the tracker that you've created, which is incredibly helpful. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=401.86s)]
*  But I think we have a screenshot of it to put on the screen. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=406.94s)]
*  There is part of it. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=412.14s)]
*  And basically, and we want to encourage people to go look at this, but it lists the most influential and significant think tanks [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=415.1s)]
*  and the amount of foreign funding that they get. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=422.94s)]
*  It has groups like the Atlantic Council, Brookings, RAND, the Center for American Progress, pretty much every recognizable and significant name [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=425.1s)]
*  within mainstream Democratic and Republican Party politics in Washington. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=433.14s)]
*  How were you able? What is it that you were able to find about this and how were you able to track it? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=436.9s)]
*  So to build out this website, we looked at all of the financial disclosures from think tanks going back five years. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=442.9s)]
*  And we looked at three different categories. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=450.06s)]
*  We looked at defense contractor funding. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=451.98s)]
*  We looked at foreign government funding and we looked at U.S. government funding. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=455.22s)]
*  And we and it's important to note also that all of that is voluntary information. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=460.46000000000004s)]
*  So think tanks will have varying degrees of transparency, like all the think tanks that you just mentioned, even though they are taking these [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=466.82s)]
*  millions of dollars from special interest sources and then some. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=474.62s)]
*  They at least disclose that information so we can they might hide it, they might bury it. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=480.5s)]
*  They also will not come out with that information until the end of the year, by which time it might not even be relevant. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=487.14s)]
*  And there are plenty of ways they can they can obfuscate that information. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=493.22s)]
*  But at the very least, they disclose some about that. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=496.3s)]
*  And so the Atlantic Council, they come out as number one in defense contractor funding and foreign government funding, taking millions and millions of [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=499.78s)]
*  dollars from sources like the UAE, Northrop Grumman. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=508.18s)]
*  At the same time, they're writing about Gulf policy or defense policy. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=513.34s)]
*  But then on the flip side, you also have what's what's not in the database. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=518.74s)]
*  And that's something that we really wanted to make clear in making this is that over a third of all think tanks are actually completely opaque, or at [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=524.3s)]
*  least of the major foreign policy think tanks. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=535.34s)]
*  They don't disclose a single dime of where they're getting their funding sources. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=537.58s)]
*  And those many of those think tanks are also the ones, you know, they're not just like some black sheep organization. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=541.5s)]
*  They're also testifying in front of Congress frequently. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=549.14s)]
*  You know, Washington Institute for Near East Policy, Foundation for Defense of Democracies, American Enterprise Institute. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=553.1800000000001s)]
*  These are quite hawkish organizations in D.C. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=559.14s)]
*  that, you know, because of their their views, they they're still invited to these these private circles to testify, to serve on commissions. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=563.9399999999999s)]
*  And we think that that should raise more more eyebrows. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=575.22s)]
*  You know, you should put your cards on the table and then that helps that should help build your legitimacy. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=577.86s)]
*  Well, among the work that you've done, you spent, I think, a couple of years in in Brazil, which is where we're based in in Santa Catarina. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=584.98s)]
*  And I remember when I first I don't know if you had this experience, but when I first started living in outside the U.S. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=592.5s)]
*  and in Brazil, I remember during the first year when I was in Brazil, maybe the second year, I had this realization when I was like, wow, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=598.1s)]
*  there's never a moment when you pick up a newspaper or you turn on the television and people are talking about what country they ought to go [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=605.5400000000001s)]
*  bomb or who they should have a war with next. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=612.3s)]
*  It just isn't part of the political discourse. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=614.5799999999999s)]
*  And as someone who had been raised in the United States and lived my entire adult life in the United States, where you're just steeped in constant debates about [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=618.54s)]
*  should you bomb this country, should you overthrow that one, should you invade this one? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=626.2199999999999s)]
*  The difference once you realize it is so stark. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=630.3s)]
*  And I think if you're immersed in the United States, you don't realize just how aberrational it is that basically our foreign policy exists [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=632.5s)]
*  to just constantly prop up militarism to ensure a close to $20 million a year budget for these giant defense corporations. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=641.18s)]
*  There's obviously a massive agenda geopolitically and financially behind that. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=648.14s)]
*  What is the relationship between the work you're doing and detecting and tracing the funding sources of these think tanks to the fact that these think tanks [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=653.34s)]
*  basically provide the intellectual fuel that keeps this war machine going? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=660.02s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=668.26s)]
*  I mean, first of all, no, I'm not exaggerating. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=669.26s)]
*  Like what I what got me interested in foreign policy in the first place was living in Brazil because I realized that, oh, we like we can actually do things differently. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=672.5s)]
*  Like, it's amazing. As you said, you know, you you don't constantly see experts funded by opaque sources saying we need to invade X country. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=684.42s)]
*  And so the relationship that that has here in the US, though, is obviously very different. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=694.2199999999999s)]
*  You know, it's where we're inundated with it on the daily. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=700.42s)]
*  And what that looks like in practice, I mean, I can give an example. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=702.9399999999999s)]
*  One thing that I was following is what think tanks have been putting out in the last few weeks now that Trump is in office. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=708.9s)]
*  And they each think tank kind of released their own version, their kind of mini version of Project 2025. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=716.02s)]
*  Everyone's familiar with the Heritage Foundations and several other organizations there. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=722.58s)]
*  Project 2025, which was this kind of blueprint for what they believed that the second Trump administration should do. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=728.34s)]
*  And think tanks kind of came to terms, came to terms with the fact that Trump is going to be in office for another four years. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=735.86s)]
*  And they all released sort of a wish list. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=743.5s)]
*  And these defense contractor funded think tanks pretty much down the line were expressing sympathetic policy recommendations to their donors. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=746.18s)]
*  I mean, I saw like the Atlantic Council, for example, was saying, you know, it was very supportive of the Iron Dome for America idea. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=756.9s)]
*  It was suggesting that we need to send F-16s to Ukraine. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=764.78s)]
*  It was suggesting to send attack teams to Ukraine just amongst several policies. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=770.54s)]
*  And obviously, if the Trump administration were to take up the Atlantic Council on any one of those recommendations, it would be a windfall by orders of magnitude for their donors. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=775.26s)]
*  You know, donors like Lockheed Martin, like Northrop Grumman, who are the who would be the manufacturers of those systems of F-16s, of the Sentinel program, which is sort of the new intercontinental ballistic missile program. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=786.46s)]
*  And so and shockingly, in some cases, you even have I think you were kind of eluding this earlier, Glenn, is that a lot of these people will wear sort of these dual hats like you can have a think tank scholar who is simultaneously serving for, you know, might have a side hustle working for someone that's in the defense industry. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=801.66s)]
*  Like that is not uncommon whatsoever. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=826.22s)]
*  I think one famous example is that James Taisley, who's the CEO of Lockheed Martin, he's also on the board of the Council, Foreign Relations and, you know, CNAS has plenty of conflicts of interest there, too. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=828.78s)]
*  So there are all these kind of dual hats and it blurs. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=842.34s)]
*  It's almost, I would say, quite purposeful that they think tanks occupy this kind of nebulous space. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=846.62s)]
*  Like they're not quite, you know, they're not academia, they're not in government, they're not in media, they're not in advocacy, but they touch on all of these things. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=855.58s)]
*  And I think they also both simultaneously signal independence while signaling a certain dependence on to their donors. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=867.0200000000001s)]
*  So it's sort of like public facing independence, private facing dependence on these folks who they rely on to continue existing. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=879.7s)]
*  I remember the first time I ever noticed that the Brookings Institution uses a website with the Internet suffix dot edu, which is generally reserved for academic institutions. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=888.62s)]
*  And I just went ballistic. I think I talked about it for two years because the deceit involved in that as though they're just involved in some neutral, neutral scholarly studies. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=899.6600000000001s)]
*  When in fact that they're highly politicized actors funded by all sorts of people with vested interests in geopolitics. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=908.62s)]
*  That was just too much to bear. Again, probably from my naive mind at the time. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=914.74s)]
*  I think that I recall and this is back in the lead up to the war in Iraq back in 2002, 2003. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=919.1800000000001s)]
*  You know, like you, I was too young to have actually looked through that. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=928.6600000000001s)]
*  I think we're roughly the same age. But I went back and looked at the history of that and discovered that there was this article. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=931.34s)]
*  I remember that really stuck with me where people inside Washington were observing the fact that the range of accepted debate was let's go and invade Iraq right this second or let's wait until the inspection process plays out and wait for UN approval. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=938.1s)]
*  And then we'll go and invade Iraq and remove Saddam. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=953.46s)]
*  And the people who were saying like, hey, we shouldn't really invade Iraq like at all were really not part of the conversation in Washington. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=956.22s)]
*  They just were people who, you know, the kind of admission price to get into the door was that you had to say, yeah, of course, I believe we should go and remove Saddam. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=964.42s)]
*  And now let's have a meeting about the best way to do that. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=973.26s)]
*  And so if you are at a think tank and you're worried about your career or the influence of the think tank, the only incentive you had was to make sure to support a war. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=975.58s)]
*  That's how you ended up inside these meetings. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=984.9399999999999s)]
*  People who were against the war, you know, they were just irrelevant and excluded from that. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=987.78s)]
*  Is that pro-war incentive something that you think continues to shape and drive the think tank culture in Washington to this day? [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=993.06s)]
*  Very much so. Yeah, I think in the lead up to the Iraq War, I believe the project for New American Century, which is one of these think tanks, you know, it's now defunct. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=1003.18s)]
*  But, you know, they played a pretty common role. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=1013.9799999999999s)]
*  They were like the hardcore neocon one of like Bill Kristol and Robert Hagan and those people. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=1015.6999999999999s)]
*  Yes, and they, you know, a lot of them ended up going into the Bush administration and they sort of laid out this blueprint. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=1021.38s)]
*  And that was, you know, before a lot of other people were doing this. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=1029.42s)]
*  But, you know, before it was cool in the 90s. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=1032.58s)]
*  And, yeah, I think it still exists today. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=1035.66s)]
*  I think the incentive structure is very much the same. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=1038.26s)]
*  I think and the reason the incentive structure is the same is that these funders are not just generously doling out funds to one or two think tanks. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=1041.82s)]
*  It's sort of like, you know, placing like an outside bet and roulette. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=1056.1s)]
*  Like they are funding across the board. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=1059.54s)]
*  If you go to our website, you can see for yourself. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=1062.82s)]
*  Most think tanks that disclose their funding sources will take funding from all three of the categories that we looked at. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=1066.5s)]
*  U.S. government funding, foreign government funding, defense contractor funding, and then some. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=1073.74s)]
*  I mean, there's so many special interests that, you know, we couldn't even incorporate it into one database. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=1077.82s)]
*  You know, big tech, all sorts of things, oil and gas companies, telecommunications industry, banks. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=1084.38s)]
*  And so, you know, these these these incentive structures exist to this day. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=1091.78s)]
*  And I think you see that, for instance, with, you know, most think tanks are pretty much unequivocally supportive of sending arms, pretty maximalist positions on Ukraine, [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=1098.26s)]
*  on the U.S. supporting Israel, Israel's war in Gaza and down the line, especially on these these these flashpoints, [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=1114.1000000000001s)]
*  because those are the ones that represent, I think, the largest windfall for, you know, their donors, Taiwan, Ukraine, Israel. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=1124.66s)]
*  You know, there are there are there are dissenting viewpoints. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=1134.5s)]
*  And I don't want to say, for instance, that they all sing with one chorus only because of these these donations. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=1137.6599999999999s)]
*  But the point is that it is a prevailing incentive structure and certainly plays a role in it. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=1144.54s)]
*  It is not the entire story, you know, ideology, experience, all these things. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=1149.9799999999998s)]
*  They play a point. They play a role for sure. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=1155.8999999999999s)]
*  But I think that, you know, our point with with carrying out this investigation is that this needs to be a larger part of this conversation so that folks can kind of call balls and strikes as they see them rather than being left in the dark over, you know, [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=1158.94s)]
*  who's funding these people and, you know, all these think tanks have dot you addresses and we just think of them as these objective sources of research. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=1176.06s)]
*  And by the way, I should also say it's not really, you know, me or the Quincy and Susanus. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=1184.6599999999999s)]
*  This is like something that there's like a real crisis of confidence in think tanks writ large. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=1190.8999999999999s)]
*  I mean, this is something that a majority of Americans have said they don't trust policy experts. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=1197.02s)]
*  And the number one reason for that being that they suspect that there's some sort of hidden agenda. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=1203.1799999999998s)]
*  And so I really want to make that point clear is that, like, for the betterment of think tanks as a sector, they should disclose these funding sources and be much more forthcoming in their reports and articles and testimony that they are receiving funds from these sources. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=1207.34s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, at the risk of appearing to use this cliche of like romanticizing ordinary people, it really is so striking how often they realize things about Washington that so many people pay to follow Washington. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=1225.62s)]
*  Simply don't realize mostly because they're paid not to realize it or they're so immersed in that culture that they've lost the ability to critique it. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=1237.3s)]
*  Everything's just so normalized to them that, in fact, ought not to be. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=1243.94s)]
*  And it also strikes me that this is really work that media outlets and journalists ought to be doing. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=1246.7s)]
*  And there has been some work on it. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=1252.1s)]
*  I remember a pretty lengthy investigation from the New York Times, maybe 2015 or so, about foreign funding of think tanks, including the Brookings Institution and Center for American Progress and others. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=1253.34s)]
*  But given how often it is the media outlets that are presenting these people as these objective kind of neutral experts that we're just supposed to trust because they're not part of any ideological agenda when, of course, they are. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=1263.58s)]
*  I'm really happy that people like you and the Quincy Institute are doing it. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=1277.7s)]
*  We will link to the tracker and the other reports that you publish. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=1281.82s)]
*  I think they're incredibly helpful. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=1287.58s)]
*  And I really appreciate you taking the time to come on and talk to us about it tonight. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=1288.7s)]
*  Thanks so much for having me, Glenn. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=1292.94s)]
*  Absolutely. Keep up the great work. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=1294.0600000000002s)]
*  We all know how manipulative mainstream media can be. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=1299.1000000000001s)]
*  Certainly viewers of this show know that. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=1301.66s)]
*  Only showing us one side of the story and not the other. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=1303.3400000000001s)]
*  That's why I started my show, why I entered journalism, because I believe in freedom of speech, as I just explained, and having candid conversations about what's really going on in the world. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=1306.18s)]
*  Luckily, there's an app and a website that believes in that, too. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=1314.94s)]
*  Ground news also prioritizes free speech over controlling the narrative for every story. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=1318.38s)]
*  You can find all the articles reporting on it worldwide with context, like if a news source has any political bias, how credible they are, and if any major corporation is influencing the reporting. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=1323.8600000000001s)]
*  All I have to do when I'm using this app is swipe through coverage with tags indicating that the narrative is being controlled by liberal corporations or independent conservative voices. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=1333.6200000000001s)]
*  I can decide myself if, for example, Trump's new external revenue service is actually a dangerous or preposterous proposal, like the Huffington Post is claiming, or if it's a fair trade initiative, like the conservative Post Millennial is reporting. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=1342.86s)]
*  If I just read one of those sources, I'd have a warm perception of what's going on. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=1356.74s)]
*  But thankfully, ground news lets me see both of those headlines side by side so I can decide for myself what is accurate. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=1359.9399999999998s)]
*  Ground news even created a dedicated feed called blindspot that exposes stories that either side of the political spectrum isn't reporting on, making it possible to spot stories that people in charge don't want you to see. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=1367.54s)]
*  Ground news is bringing back transparency in the news and civil discourse right from your phone or computer. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=1378.54s)]
*  Best of all, they're independent and subscriber supported, and they're offering by viewers 40% off the same vantage plan I use to get unlimited access to all of their features this month. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1luRfpAgXA&t=1384.02s)]
