# From Wounded To Wagging His Tail Pointer's Unbelievable Determination To Survive
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [January 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k)
*  Fortunately, as many of you know, we end each week with our newly installed system update [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=0.0s)]
*  segment where every Friday night as our last segment just to end on kind of a inspiring [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=13.14s)]
*  note and a high note to leave you with for the weekend before we come back on Monday [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=18.64s)]
*  with worse news. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=21.98s)]
*  We show you a, we feature a dog who we have rescued who's either living with us at home [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=23.48s)]
*  or who is living in our shelter. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=29.96s)]
*  One of the 200 or so dogs that we rescued, we talked about their unique rescue story, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=33.480000000000004s)]
*  the way in which they responded to it, the trajectory and evolution of the dog through [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=37.4s)]
*  the life after having been rescued. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=41.64s)]
*  It's often a very inspirational story, both for the dog but for the humans who participate [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=44.28s)]
*  as well. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=48.72s)]
*  Both sides get enormous benefit and there's usually really interesting lessons to learn [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=49.72s)]
*  as well about humanity and just navigating through life from these stories as well. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=54.2s)]
*  Tonight's starring dog is named Pointer. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=60.160000000000004s)]
*  As I indicated at the top of the show, he was found by me in such a hideous and brutal [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=63.080000000000005s)]
*  state, very close to death obviously as you'll see. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=70.52000000000001s)]
*  Some of the images and videos that show the rescue can be a little bit disturbing but [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=73.60000000000001s)]
*  just know that it all has a happy outcome, a very happy ending. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=77.1s)]
*  I think it's really worth seeing just because you'll be able to see how extreme the resilience [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=80.72s)]
*  that he needed was to get through all of that and how much it has paid off for him and for [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=86.6s)]
*  everybody around him in the end. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=90.76s)]
*  So here's Pointer starring in tonight's episode of System Pup Date. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=92.6s)]
*  Hey everybody, meet the star of tonight's newest episode of System Pup Date. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=96.8s)]
*  Here he is in front of me. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=107.32s)]
*  He is Pointer, that is his name. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=108.68s)]
*  We named him that because we weren't sure what was going to happen with him for a reason [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=111.52000000000001s)]
*  about to explain it's quite a dramatic and difficult rescue story that obviously has [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=118.2s)]
*  a happy ending but he looks like a Pointer even though he's not, he looks like that breed. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=123.72s)]
*  So we just temporarily named him that, we didn't want to get too attached to him and [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=128.16s)]
*  the reason is that the way we found him was I was driving up the hill to go to our house [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=130.76s)]
*  where we lived in kind of the middle of the forest, that's when we started having a lot [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=136.98s)]
*  of dogs and there was somebody who worked at one of the houses, kind of like a handyman [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=140.01999999999998s)]
*  or whatever, and he was walking with this dog and I've never seen a dog in the state [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=145.78s)]
*  that he was. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=151.54s)]
*  He was utterly emaciated, you could see his ribs, his bones, everything just sticking [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=152.54s)]
*  out of his body and the thing that was shocking was he had a gigantic wound all across his [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=158.42s)]
*  body, just open, red, seeing the blood vessels, veins, it was like the skin was no longer [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=166.46s)]
*  there. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=174.66s)]
*  And I never imagined that he was going to survive, I mean, and then I stopped and I [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=176.70000000000002s)]
*  talked to the guy and he said I just found him like this, I'm not sure what to do, he [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=181.42000000000002s)]
*  didn't have money to bring him to a clinic which he obviously needed but he was doing [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=185.22s)]
*  what he could to do. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=188.82s)]
*  He was definitely abused because of his personality but he was also so traumatized, I mean, who [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=196.46s)]
*  wouldn't be by that? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=205.82s)]
*  And he had a lot of other things wrong with him as well but that was just the most shocking, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=208.70000000000002s)]
*  the most viscerally shocking. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=211.96s)]
*  So I took him, I took him to the vet, the vet said don't expect this dog to leave the [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=213.9s)]
*  clinic because they too had really never seen a dog in that state. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=219.42000000000002s)]
*  But somehow he was determined to live and he got slightly better and slightly better, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=224.94s)]
*  probably stayed like two weeks in the clinic until he could come home, there was obviously [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=231.06s)]
*  a huge amount of care involved. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=234.22s)]
*  And kind of every day that went by that wound closed just a tiny little bit and all the [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=236.57999999999998s)]
*  other ailments started to get treated and he started to become more active. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=243.95999999999998s)]
*  Even to this very day he's not the most trusting dog, you can kind of see there's some kind [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=250.5s)]
*  of fear in his eyes, he's super sweet. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=254.38s)]
*  But he never became like an incredibly trusting dog because I don't even know what he went [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=258.14s)]
*  through but whatever it was, it was quite traumatizing and quite difficult, it would [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=263.65999999999997s)]
*  be for anybody. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=267.58s)]
*  But he's comfortable around other dogs now, he loves people, he's been with us for I [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=269.24s)]
*  would say eight years or so, seven, eight years and I think when we found him he was [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=275.65999999999997s)]
*  probably about a year old. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=279.78s)]
*  He's got through that, all that, it took him like a full year to be recovered and then [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=281.18s)]
*  he started running, he started walking first and he started running, then he learned how [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=285.38s)]
*  to play with other dogs, he became integrated, he became integrated with other people. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=288.42s)]
*  And now he's just a cool dog, I mean he's pretty independent, he's pretty chill. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=292.66s)]
*  He we're in a part of the house where he isn't often so he's a little on guard but especially [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=297.78000000000003s)]
*  when he's in his areas he's very, very active and a happy dog, he wags his tail all the [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=304.38s)]
*  time and it's really, sometimes I can't even believe myself when I look at those pictures [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=310.98s)]
*  and videos that he was able to survive. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=315.74s)]
*  As you can see it's incredibly grave and horrifying but this is one of the most gratifying rescues [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=317.58000000000004s)]
*  we've ever done because when we picked him up he was just almost worse than his physical [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=323.42s)]
*  state was his mental state. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=327.78000000000003s)]
*  As you might imagine, he just didn't know what was happening, he was on the verge of [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=330.34000000000003s)]
*  most painful and horrible way and as that got better so did his personality and now [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=334.74s)]
*  he's, you know, this awesome dog and he's been with us for a long time, he's super healthy, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=342.5s)]
*  never had any really health problems and he's just a good, healthy, happy dog and it's incredibly [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=347.78000000000003s)]
*  gratifying rescue story, the sort of thing that is obviously very dramatic but ultimately [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=353.22s)]
*  those are the stories that really make their biggest mark on you. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXu1YJBe58k&t=358.16s)]
