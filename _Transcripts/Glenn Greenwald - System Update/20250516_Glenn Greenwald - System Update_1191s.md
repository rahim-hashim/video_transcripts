# Trump, Macron Fawn Over Rebranded Syrian Terrorist?
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [May 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0)
*  There is this very strange phenomenon that I've actually been talking about and writing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=0.0s)]
*  about for a long time, which is, I can get myself settled on the right spot as well, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=10.9s)]
*  which is how malleable and empty this term terrorism seems to be in terms of the way [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=16.62s)]
*  it's applied. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=26.2s)]
*  It's an obviously extremely central term. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=27.2s)]
*  In fact, we fought a war for 20 years after 9-11 in multiple different countries in the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=29.66s)]
*  name of stopping terrorism. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=34.5s)]
*  We constantly kill people or imprison them based on accusations that they're terrorists. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=37.58s)]
*  And yet so often, and there's that old saying that one man's terrorist is another man's [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=43.66s)]
*  freedom fighter, we take people who we like and then when we don't like them, we call [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=49.260000000000005s)]
*  them terrorists or we take people we don't like and call them terrorists and then when [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=55.54s)]
*  we decide that they're actually of use to us, we say, oh, that term doesn't apply anymore. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=58.62s)]
*  And it obviously leads to the question of what is the origin of this term? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=63.339999999999996s)]
*  Where did it come from? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=66.66s)]
*  And does it actually mean anything? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=67.66s)]
*  Here from the New York Times on May 14th, which was yesterday, there's an article about [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=71.5s)]
*  how Trump met the former, okay, put this headline on the screen because I find it so interesting. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=77.62s)]
*  It says Trump meets former militant who now leads Syria. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=83.58s)]
*  Now that word militant is a very nice word. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=88.14s)]
*  It's very benign. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=91.62s)]
*  You can be militant about anything. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=92.94s)]
*  I can be militant about wanting to cure cancer. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=95.26s)]
*  I can be militant about wanting to feed children. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=97.34s)]
*  Doesn't really scare anyone. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=101.02s)]
*  So if you were going to be accurate with this New York Times headline, you would say Trump [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=103.14s)]
*  meets former al-Qaeda terrorist who now leads Syria. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=106.42s)]
*  That's how the press and our government and most Western governments have described him [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=110.3s)]
*  until five months ago, a fugitive, monstrous al-Qaeda terrorist. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=114.7s)]
*  But the New York Times can't use that headline because of course people would be thinking, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=119.7s)]
*  wait a minute, we fought a war for 20 years against al-Qaeda and now our own president [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=123.5s)]
*  meets and embraces one of their most monstrous terrorists. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=130.02s)]
*  But this is how language changes so quickly, so instantaneously whenever it serves an advantage [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=137.42000000000002s)]
*  The article reports, quote, President Trump's conversation with President al-Mansal al-Sharah, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=144.54s)]
*  no more Jelani, who once led a branch of al-Qaeda was the first time in 25 years that the leaders [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=150.26000000000002s)]
*  of the United States and Syria had met. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=156.06s)]
*  So apparently Bashar al-Assad was beyond the pale. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=160.38s)]
*  Nobody could meet him. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=164.22s)]
*  When Tulsi Gabbard went to meet him as a member of Congress trying to understand the war there, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=166.86s)]
*  to this very day she's maligned over that. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=171.82000000000002s)]
*  That was the main attack on her, one of them in her confirmation hearing, the other being [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=174.82000000000002s)]
*  that she has long opposed war and was eavesdropping on Americans, but oh you went to Syria, you [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=179.66s)]
*  met with Assad. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=185.06s)]
*  And yet now that there's an al-Qaeda terrorist running the country, one who was in Iraq killing [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=188.3s)]
*  American soldiers, it's now okay to meet with him. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=194.98000000000002s)]
*  Here from Reuters also yesterday, Syrian leader Shahr's path from global jihad to meeting [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=198.9s)]
*  Trump. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=205.86s)]
*  What a nice path, from global jihad to meeting Trump. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=206.86s)]
*  Quote, Syria's Ahmed al-Sharah has transformed himself, or maybe the West has transformed [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=210.66s)]
*  him, from al-Qaeda militant to Syrian president in a dramatic political rise, kept on Wednesday [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=217.62s)]
*  by meeting with US President Donald Trump. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=223.82s)]
*  The encounter in Saudi Arabia is a milestone for a man who joined al-Qaeda in Iraq around [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=226.74s)]
*  the time of the 2003 US-led invasion and spent years in US prisons there before returning [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=230.66s)]
*  to Syria to join the insurgency against Bashar al-Assad. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=236.58s)]
*  Now you might question, so he was in a US prison because he was killing US soldiers [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=240.26000000000002s)]
*  as part of al-Qaeda, he was kept there and then he was released. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=247.9s)]
*  We don't usually release people we claim are al-Qaeda terrorists, we put them in Guantanamo [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=251.3s)]
*  where they stay forever. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=255.34s)]
*  But he was released and he then went and led the insurgency against Bashar al-Assad, so [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=257.18s)]
*  maybe there was like a deal struck when he was in a US prison where he agreed to become [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=261.3s)]
*  an agent of the US to help, remember it was the US policy under President Obama to wage [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=267.38s)]
*  a dirty war to get rid of Bashar al-Assad and we fought alongside al-Qaeda and even [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=273.22s)]
*  ISIS to do it. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=278.18s)]
*  There's those famous WikiLeaks documents where Hillary Clinton says we're actually fighting [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=280.54s)]
*  on the side of al-Qaeda in Syria. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=285.14s)]
*  So there's a long relationship between the US and Chalani, namely that he spent years [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=288.41999999999996s)]
*  in a US prison in Iraq until they released him to go lead the insurgency to take down [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=293.9s)]
*  Assad. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=299.84s)]
*  Quote, the meeting following Trump's announcement of an end to US sanctions on Syria is a huge [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=300.84s)]
*  boost for Shahra as he tries to bring the fractured country under his control and revive [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=305.7s)]
*  And Trump said he was looking forward to normalizing his ties with Damascus. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=311.1s)]
*  This is how Trump described him after, quote, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=318.22s)]
*  He's got the potential. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=320.34000000000003s)]
*  He's a real leader, Trump told reporters on Air Force One after meeting Shahra, whom he [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=321.34000000000003s)]
*  described as a young, attractive guy with a very strong past. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=325.66s)]
*  Quote, He's got a real shot at holding it together, Trump said. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=329.26000000000005s)]
*  Shahra took power and his Islamist fighters launched an offensive from their enclave in [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=333.46000000000004s)]
*  the Northwest in 2024 and toppled Assad, whose allies, Russia and Iran, were distracted [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=337.46s)]
*  by other wars. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=342.06s)]
*  He was long better known as Abu Mohammed al-Ghalani. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=343.53999999999996s)]
*  His nom de guerre, his war name, as commander of the Nusra Front, an insurgent group fighting [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=350.85999999999996s)]
*  Assad and for years was al-Qaeda's official wing in the conflict. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=356.29999999999995s)]
*  He cut ties with al-Qaeda in 2016, gradually recasting his group as part of the Syrian [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=360.7s)]
*  revolution rather than global jihad. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=365.66s)]
*  Shahra swapped combat fatigues for suits and ties after entering Damascus as Syria's de facto [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=368.66s)]
*  ruler in December 2024, promising to replace Assad's brutal police state with an inclusive [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=375.3s)]
*  and just order. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=380.78000000000003s)]
*  Nice little liberal democracy led by al-Qaeda. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=382.78000000000003s)]
*  Now it says there that he stopped being affiliated with al-Qaeda in 2016, but all the way up [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=385.70000000000005s)]
*  until December 2024, just again, five months ago, not even five months ago, the US had [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=394.21999999999997s)]
*  a bounty on his head for $5 million because he was an al-Qaeda terrorist. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=399.62s)]
*  Here from France 24, this is what he did before meeting Trump on May 6, quote, Macron to host [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=404.53999999999996s)]
*  Syria's al-Sharra in the new leader's first European visit. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=410.78s)]
*  Syria's new interim leader, al-Sharra, will make his first European visit in a meeting [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=415.74s)]
*  with French President Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday, the French presidency said Tuesday, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=420.78s)]
*  in an effort to bolster the ties between the two countries despite deeply sectarian violence [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=425.17999999999995s)]
*  in Syria. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=430.14s)]
*  Here from the BBC, this was December 16th, UK diplomats meet the rebel leader in Damascus. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=433.41999999999996s)]
*  Quote, British diplomats have held talks with the leader of the Syrian rebel group, Hayat [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=440.14s)]
*  Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, following its ousting of President Bashar al-Assad more than a week [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=444.61999999999995s)]
*  ago. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=449.58s)]
*  He was at a time when the US still had a bounty on his head for $5 million. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=450.58s)]
*  Here from Euronews talking about his transformation once he arrived in Syria, the headline is [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=456.09999999999997s)]
*  former al-Qaeda leader, al-Jilani, this was before they gave him a name change, rebrands [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=463.06s)]
*  as a pluralist amid doubts. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=469.26s)]
*  Ahmad al-Sharra, formerly Abu Mohammed al-Jilani, has evolved from an al-Qaeda affiliate leader [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=471.62s)]
*  to a rebranded figure promoting pluralism. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=478.46s)]
*  As Syria's insurgency topples Assad, despite his attempts at moderation, doubts remain [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=482.02s)]
*  about his democratic intentions. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=487.17999999999995s)]
*  Oh, you mean somebody who was an al-Qaeda, essentially their entire adult life, may not [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=488.97999999999996s)]
*  actually mean it when he says, yes, we welcome all religions, we love everybody, we're going [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=495.34s)]
*  to be a DEI country. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=501.38s)]
*  Diversity, equity and inclusion, that's the new Syria and I, the al-Qaeda leader, is [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=503.42s)]
*  going to lead that. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=509.78000000000003s)]
*  Here's video of how much formality and respect was given to him on his visit to Paris to [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=512.5s)]
*  meet Macron. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=520.1s)]
*  You see Macron out in front of the presidential palace, greeting him as soon as he steps [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=521.1s)]
*  out of his chauffeured car, they're both wearing very nice suits. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=524.02s)]
*  Bill Jadalani, Macron goes to greet his car, gives him a very nice handshake, invites him [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=527.14s)]
*  into the presidential palace, puts his arm around him, they wave to the crowd, they wave [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=539.78s)]
*  to the media. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=549.5s)]
*  Do you know how many countries France has bombed as well in the name of stopping al-Qaeda? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=553.42s)]
*  But we've talked about this before, we've done this many times on our show, where we [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=563.74s)]
*  showed you how essentially for a decade, from 2012 to 2022, all of the media in the West [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=568.0s)]
*  Azov battalion in Ukraine as a neo-Nazi, fascist, white supremacist militant group inside Ukraine, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=579.5s)]
*  there were bills passed to ensure that they were sanctioned, that they couldn't get any [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=587.58s)]
*  American aid or American money or American weapons. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=591.3s)]
*  They were considered one of the worst groups on the planet. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=594.22s)]
*  They worshipped members of the SS from World War II and they worshipped leaders who collaborated [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=597.22s)]
*  with the Germans to kill Poles, to kill Jews. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=604.38s)]
*  And then suddenly once Russia mass invaded Ukraine in February 2022 and the Azov battalion [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=609.5s)]
*  became the most effective and most well-trained leaders, the whole discord shifted. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=617.2199999999999s)]
*  No longer were they referred to as neo-Nazi or extremists or fascists, they were nationalists. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=623.8199999999999s)]
*  And then we saw the same newspapers that spent a decade maligning them as Nazis suddenly [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=631.6s)]
*  writing fluff pieces about their leaders, glorifying them. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=637.46s)]
*  It just shows you how quickly they'll just change the propaganda the minute that it suits [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=643.76s)]
*  them and none of these words have any meaning. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=649.6800000000001s)]
*  Here was the poster printed on the DOJ site of the now respected and beloved president. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=653.82s)]
*  Again, this was there even after he entered Damascus. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=662.12s)]
*  There's a picture of him looking much different, not wearing his suits or ties. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=665.46s)]
*  And it says, stop this terrorist, Muhammad al-Jilani. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=671.4200000000001s)]
*  And then it says reward for justice. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=676.1800000000001s)]
*  And then you see at the bottom, up to a $10 million reward. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=678.94s)]
*  And then there's some small print here that says, Muhammad al-Jilani, also known as Abu [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=682.86s)]
*  Muhammad al-Jilani, and then several other names that he uses, is the senior leader of [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=688.98s)]
*  the terrorist organization, the al-Nusra Front. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=696.4599999999999s)]
*  Al-Qaeda's affiliate in Syria. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=699.86s)]
*  Under Jilani's leadership, ANF has carried out multiple terrorist attacks through Syria, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=702.4599999999999s)]
*  often targeting civilians. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=709.02s)]
*  The US government is offering a reward of up to $10 million for information about al-Jilani. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=710.5s)]
*  Absolute confidentiality is assured and relocation may be available if you have any information [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=715.3s)]
*  contact the DOJ. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=719.5s)]
*  Now if this were 2003, I would be like, all right, maybe he had a major reform. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=722.66s)]
*  He's no, whatever. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=726.7s)]
*  This was five months ago. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=728.14s)]
*  And obviously a big part of what happened in Syria, as Netanyahu boasted, as was official [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=733.1s)]
*  policy, is that the US and Israel all wanted Assad gone. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=739.38s)]
*  And this was the person who basically led the insurgency against him. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=745.46s)]
*  With the help of the Sunnis, he took Rodney DeBasquez. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=750.62s)]
*  Netanyahu boasted about how it was the IDF that enabled this to happen. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=753.42s)]
*  And then Israel proceeded to bomb, massively bomb all the military assets of Syria, just [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=759.06s)]
*  went in and took land that they wanted. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=765.66s)]
*  And Jilani did nothing, because part of the deal obviously was that he would be much more [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=768.98s)]
*  subservient to the US and Israel and the West, using Syrian resources for the West. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=775.5s)]
*  Same thing we saw in Libya when they took out Gaddafi because they were concerned he [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=781.78s)]
*  was going to nationalize the oil reserves of Libya and use it not for the West's profit, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=784.66s)]
*  but for the benefit of the Libyan people. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=790.34s)]
*  That's one thing the West does not tolerate. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=793.4200000000001s)]
*  You know, what's so interesting about this is that if you were to have given money to [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=796.54s)]
*  Jilani six months ago, you would be guilty of a major felony of basically giving material [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=802.18s)]
*  support to terror groups. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=811.6999999999999s)]
*  And that's not just abstract. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=812.8199999999999s)]
*  Here from the New York Times in February of 2024, so basically a year ago, a Manhattan [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=814.14s)]
*  woman is convicted of using crypto to fund terror groups in Syria. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=818.54s)]
*  And the terror group that she was alleged to have funded was al-Nusra, Jilani's group. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=824.7s)]
*  So now the West is giving him all sorts of money, but just a year ago, if you gave money, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=833.58s)]
*  you would go to prison for various serious felony charges. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=839.62s)]
*  Imagine being in prison because you gave money to Jilani's group or to Jilani, and then not [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=844.62s)]
*  even a year later, seeing the entire West unite and say, no, he's not a terrorist. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=850.58s)]
*  He's a very important and respected world leader who deserves our esteem and respect. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=854.68s)]
*  And you're sitting in prison because you were convicted not even a year ago of having given [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=858.8399999999999s)]
*  him money. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=864.2399999999999s)]
*  As I said, this is something that I've been writing about a long time. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=865.2399999999999s)]
*  Other people have been writing about a long time as well. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=870.42s)]
*  Here's an article that appeared in Salon, which is the magazine where I worked, and [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=872.88s)]
*  this was August of 2011. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=878.1999999999999s)]
*  This was actually written by my colleague who became my colleague at the Intercept as [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=880.52s)]
*  well, Murtaza Hussein, and the title is, US Politicians' Favorite Terrorist Groups. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=885.5600000000001s)]
*  And this is what he wrote, quote, supporting designated terrorist organizations, especially [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=892.22s)]
*  in the context of the indefinitely ongoing war on terror, is something for which a great [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=896.52s)]
*  number of individuals in the United States are currently serving lengthy prison sentences. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=901.76s)]
*  It seems to defy logic that the members of MEK, a group which has attacked US interests [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=906.76s)]
*  all over the world, which is an Iranian exile group, are able at the same time to stroll [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=912.02s)]
*  the halls of Congress and exercise significant financial influence over US government representatives [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=917.12s)]
*  in order to achieve their objectives. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=922.4s)]
*  Make no mistake, the MEK is no less, quote, terrorist than any of the other groups for [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=924.04s)]
*  which one can go to jail for merely having contact with. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=928.38s)]
*  In addition to openly acknowledging to have killed thousands of Iranians, MEK is directly [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=931.0s)]
*  implicated in the death of American civilians and military officials in Tehran during the [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=935.62s)]
*  1970s, killing for which no MEK member has ever been brought to justice. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=940.58s)]
*  The fact that US officials are now openly consorting with them and receiving funding [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=944.26s)]
*  from them, huge numbers of American officials were on the payroll of the MEK. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=949.9s)]
*  It turns out Howard Dean was, and he went around ranting against the Iranian machine, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=955.26s)]
*  they pay US officials and new prominent US political figures and media figures to go [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=960.58s)]
*  around praising them and condemning the Iranian government, and say we need to do regime [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=964.34s)]
*  change there because they're just spreading a money around and they are a terrorist group. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=971.86s)]
*  Quote, the fact that US officials are openly consorting with and receiving funding from [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=976.5400000000001s)]
*  a group with American blood on its hands in order to promote that group's interests is [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=980.1s)]
*  something which may escape the notice of its citizenry, but it is keenly watched by Iranians [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=983.7800000000001s)]
*  and others who are looking to gauge the level of integrity and consistency in US policy. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=988.6600000000001s)]
*  The selective application of the label of quote terrorist based on who the US is choosing [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=994.0799999999999s)]
*  to fight at any given point is further evidence of the bankruptcy of this term. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=998.0s)]
*  Terrorists quote unquote are those who are interred in CIA black sites subject to legally [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=1003.48s)]
*  sanctioned torture and killed without public outcry. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=1008.52s)]
*  But as the case of the MEK shows the very definition of who is a terrorist is based [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=1011.88s)]
*  not upon what individual acts or groups commit, but how favorably or unfavorably those acts [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=1015.56s)]
*  are viewed in Washington. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=1021.3199999999999s)]
*  And of course, the most notable example is that when the Mujahideen in Afghanistan, which [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=1024.36s)]
*  attracted people from all throughout the Middle East including Osama bin Laden and others, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=1033.36s)]
*  were resisting the Soviet Union's invasion in the 1980s, the US loved the Mujahideen, [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=1039.72s)]
*  heaped all kinds of praise on them, celebrated them as freedom fighters, and then when that [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=1047.1599999999999s)]
*  group turned around and started resisting the US invasion of Afghanistan, suddenly [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=1053.28s)]
*  those very same people motivated by the very same thing suddenly became evil terrorists [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=1059.48s)]
*  that we put into Guantanamo simply for defending Afghanistan against the United States invasion. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=1064.3999999999999s)]
*  I mean, how can you not see with the Aizab battalion with the Mujahideen with Jelani and [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=1069.3999999999999s)]
*  so many other examples that this term terrorist means whatever the government wants it to [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=1077.6s)]
*  mean at any given moment, which means essentially that it doesn't actually have any real or [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=1082.68s)]
*  fixed meaning. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=1086.96s)]
*  It's as central to our discourse that word is as it is meaningless and bereft of any [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=1088.68s)]
*  real meaning. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8-5zT_JBr0&t=1094.74s)]
