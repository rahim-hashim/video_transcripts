# Substack CEO Warns Student Detainment over Op-Ed was Clear "Line in the Sand" for Free Speech
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [April 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ)
*  When I resigned from the Intercept, the media outlet that I co-founded, I immediately went [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=0.0s)]
*  to Substack, a platform I didn't know very much about and had an extremely positive experience [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=11.52s)]
*  there the entire time I was there, in large part because they were very committed to giving [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=18.1s)]
*  their writers total freedom and protecting freedom of speech. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=22.34s)]
*  So you didn't have to worry about saying something that the platform would dislike or that would [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=25.5s)]
*  ban you. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=28.66s)]
*  Substack is a platform really devoted to free speech. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=29.66s)]
*  Chris Bass is a co-founder and CEO of Substack and he has really fought, as has Substack, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=32.9s)]
*  to defend the rights of free speech while connecting users with creators, ideas, and [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=39.1s)]
*  communities they care about most. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=43.42s)]
*  It was founded in 2017. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=45.019999999999996s)]
*  Substack is building a new economic engine for culture by putting publishers in charge [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=47.019999999999996s)]
*  and enabling subscribers to support the work they deeply value. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=52.22s)]
*  Before Substack, Chris was the co-founder and CTO of the mobile messenger app Kit and [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=55.98s)]
*  from 2009 to 2017 he helped scale Kit and built a platform used by over 300 million [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=60.379999999999995s)]
*  users. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=66.34s)]
*  It is always a pleasure to welcome him to our show. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=67.34s)]
*  Chris, good evening. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=69.25999999999999s)]
*  Thanks so much for taking the time to join us. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=70.25999999999999s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=73.14s)]
*  All right, so let's get right into this because you have teamed up, you meaning Substack, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=74.14s)]
*  which I sort of consider to be the new ACLU, what the ACLU was before they kind of prioritized [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=82.26s)]
*  partisan agendas above their original values. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=88.86s)]
*  FIRE has been speaking out quite vocally even though they had developed a mostly conservative [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=93.06s)]
*  audience because they had been defending conservative speech on campus about a lot of these new [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=97.74000000000001s)]
*  censorship attacks coming from the new administration. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=102.22s)]
*  You joined with FIRE and the idea was to partner to protect writers in America, especially [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=105.9s)]
*  ones who are somehow being targeted or punished for their descent on foreign policy or Israel [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=111.82000000000001s)]
*  or any other topics. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=115.54s)]
*  I just wanted to read some of this statement and then kind of ask you what prompted it [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=116.54s)]
*  before we get into the details. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=120.02000000000001s)]
*  The statement says, in his farewell address to the nation, President Ronald Reagan remarked [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=121.98s)]
*  that America is freedom and it's this freedom that makes the country a magnet for those [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=126.06s)]
*  around the world. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=130.54000000000002s)]
*  America has sent a very different message to foreigners residing in America lawfully. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=132.42s)]
*  You can stay here but only if you give up your freedom of speech. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=137.42s)]
*  Since our founding, America has long welcomed writers and thinkers from across the globe [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=140.5s)]
*  who come to this country and contribute to the richness of our political and cultural [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=145.14s)]
*  life. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=148.54s)]
*  Christopher Hitchens was one of President Bill Clinton's sharpest critics. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=149.54s)]
*  Alexander Cockburn punched in all directions and Ayn Rand minced no words in her condemnation [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=152.38s)]
*  of socialism. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=157.46s)]
*  To preserve America's tradition as a home for fearless writing, FIRE and SUBSTAC are [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=158.86s)]
*  partnering to support writers residing lawfully in the country targeted by the government [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=164.22s)]
*  for the content of their writing. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=168.34s)]
*  Those who, as Hitchens once put it, quote, committed no crime except that of thought [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=170.06s)]
*  in writing. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=174.34s)]
*  If you fit in this category, whether or not you publish on SUBSTAC, we urge you to get [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=175.34s)]
*  in touch immediately. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=178.54000000000002s)]
*  I want to delve into the specifics of the program. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=180.74s)]
*  Before I do that, it's not all that usual for a company that is a for-profit company, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=184.58s)]
*  which is true of SUBSTAC, to take such a vocal position on controversial issues. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=191.02s)]
*  What is it that prompted you to do so? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=196.02s)]
*  SUBSTAC doesn't take positions broadly on political issues. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=200.74s)]
*  We don't take a position, for example, on immigration policy or foreign policy, but [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=204.76000000000002s)]
*  we do see freedom of speech and freedom of the press as centrally important to our business [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=209.66s)]
*  and our mission. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=216.06s)]
*  This felt really important. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=217.74s)]
*  I get that. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=220.46s)]
*  Free speech, in my view, has been central to your identity and to your function and [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=221.46s)]
*  your mission from the beginning. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=227.18s)]
*  I've never really seen it in conflict with your business model, although it certainly [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=229.01999999999998s)]
*  can be. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=233.2s)]
*  If you take any kind of position, even one just vaguely in support of free speech, that [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=234.3s)]
*  certainly can. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=238.06s)]
*  The statement refers to new sorts of attacks on the right of free thought, the right of [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=239.22s)]
*  free expression. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=245.46s)]
*  I'm just wondering, was there a tipping point or a triggering point for you over the last [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=246.46s)]
*  couple of months where you decided SUBSTAC needed to do something? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=251.62s)]
*  I think the event that put this in the SUBSTAC Ballywick was the OzTurk editorial and deportation. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=256.74s)]
*  The fact that somebody is being, as far as we know, targeted for the contents of an editorial [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=266.6s)]
*  that they co-published, to us, that's a very clear free speech issue. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=274.36s)]
*  Even though we wouldn't take a stance on any old thing that happened, that felt like a [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=281.12s)]
*  very clear line in the sand where we've had this SUBSTAC Defender program for years that [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=285.98s)]
*  helps defend free speech from legal threats. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=291.18s)]
*  It's helped dozens of cases. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=293.52s)]
*  We wanted to make sure that we were stepping in and helping wherever we could on this issue. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=294.94s)]
*  We're delighted to partner with FIRE, who's just a fantastic organization. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=301.34s)]
*  Yeah, for those who don't know and viewers of the show know because we covered that story, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=304.34s)]
*  in depth what you're referring to is a Turkish-born PhD student at Tufts who was in the United [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=308.65999999999997s)]
*  States very legally working on her PhD program. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=314.78s)]
*  She was recently snatched up by plainclothes officers on the street. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=319.59999999999997s)]
*  She was obviously very frightened. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=324.76s)]
*  She didn't even know these were agents of the state. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=325.76s)]
*  They arrived in our cars. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=327.71999999999997s)]
*  They grabbed her phone that she was using so they could have access to her phone and [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=329.52s)]
*  then shipped her away to a deportation facility in Louisiana. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=332.96s)]
*  The only thing the government alleges or the only thing groups that monitor people like [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=339.47999999999996s)]
*  this allege is this op-ed. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=342.88s)]
*  There's no claim that she even participated in the protest, let alone harassed anybody [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=345.08s)]
*  or blocked anyone's entrance or vandalized a building. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=349.04s)]
*  It's really, apparently solely about the op-ed. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=351.92s)]
*  Now you just mentioned you were happy to join with FIRE. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=356.04s)]
*  I'm just wondering how did that come about and why FIRE? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=358.04s)]
*  You know, there aren't that many consistent defenders of freedom of the press. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=362.96s)]
*  Freedom of speech is something that I think has a lot of fair weather friends. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=368.15999999999997s)]
*  You know, it's something that we've tried to be consistent about over the years and [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=372.56s)]
*  I've been very impressed by FIRE as well. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=376.12s)]
*  You mentioned in the intro, you know, they were sort of known for defending right-wing [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=378.76s)]
*  people against threats of censorship, but they also do that across the political spectrum. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=383.42s)]
*  I think they're just very values aligned on this issue and I know Greg Glukianoff. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=389.42s)]
*  I think they're fantastic and we're just happy to partner with them. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=394.46s)]
*  Yeah, I just got to underscore that. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=397.94s)]
*  I mean, I know some of the people who founded and run FIRE, including Greg who you just [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=399.53999999999996s)]
*  mentioned, who actually are quite vocal supporters of Israel, very vocal support of Israel just [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=405.82s)]
*  in their personal views and yet they've spent a lot of time defending pro-Palestinian speech [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=410.5s)]
*  on campus because their mission is to defend free speech regardless of what they think [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=414.96s)]
*  about it. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=419.1s)]
*  You know, Chris, I was thinking about this earlier today and kind of it's very ironic [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=420.1s)]
*  because when I first came to Substack, it was late 2020, so a little bit more than four [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=423.08s)]
*  years now. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=428.74s)]
*  It wasn't very well known, but it was starting to be better known before I got there and [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=430.98s)]
*  certainly over the next year, but the criticism of it at the time was that because it allowed [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=435.42s)]
*  free speech, it was basically some sort of right wing or even hospitable to fascism kind [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=440.38s)]
*  of outlet. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=447.84000000000003s)]
*  When in reality, you weren't promoting right wing speech, you were just offering a platform [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=448.84000000000003s)]
*  for people who had been censored, who wanted to come and you had a ton of writers who weren't [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=453.8s)]
*  even remotely on the right, but that was the argument was, oh look, you have some far right [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=457.46000000000004s)]
*  and you have some writers who are Trump supporters and therefore you're platforming fascists [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=462.65999999999997s)]
*  and that was the attack on you. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=469.06s)]
*  Now here we are four years later and what you're essentially saying is you want to make [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=470.97999999999996s)]
*  sure that people who are writing at Substack have the right to criticize foreign policy [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=475.41999999999996s)]
*  including US foreign policy toward Israel or to the Middle East or anything else and [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=479.68s)]
*  kind of protect them from some of these programs we've seen from the Trump administration. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=484.5s)]
*  My guess is or there's certainly a possibility that if you start protecting people who have [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=489.06s)]
*  that perspective, you kind of now get the opposing accusation, oh you're protecting [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=493.26000000000005s)]
*  left wing radicals or even that you're anti-Semitic, which if you haven't gotten yet, I'm sure [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=499.42s)]
*  you're likely to given this program. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=505.90000000000003s)]
*  What is the mission of Substack in terms of dealing with any types of those accusations? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=509.3s)]
*  I think the biggest thing is to have principles, know what you stand for and why, stay calm [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=514.9s)]
*  and make sure that you're sort of consistently trying to live up to the principle and you're [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=525.1s)]
*  absolutely right that I think free speech is a mechanism that protects writers and thinkers [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=530.0400000000001s)]
*  from power and so at any given time people will look at freedom of speech as a partisan [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=537.1s)]
*  issue or as a one sided issue but over a long enough time horizon we've just seen this. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=544.22s)]
*  We've had people come to Substack in recent years who had been former critics of us who [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=549.34s)]
*  used to say Substack is this evil right or left wing place because it platforms this [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=554.28s)]
*  thing. They wind up finding themselves censored when the worm turns and they come to appreciate [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=558.78s)]
*  the wisdom of a consistent stance in favor of freedom of thought, freedom of speech, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=564.26s)]
*  freedom of the press. I think that we've been doing that for long enough that the evidence [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=570.38s)]
*  says we're not doing it for one side. It's a consistent policy and I really believe in [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=575.02s)]
*  it. I think it's the best thing for the platform. I think it's the best thing for the country. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=579.9399999999999s)]
*  One of the things that being here at Rumble has impressed me about is that they have a [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=584.42s)]
*  very kind of vigorous commitment to this same principle. It's a place for anyone to come, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=588.66s)]
*  anyone to be heard. It's not their place to sit in judgment of which opinions are sufficiently [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=593.7s)]
*  right or wrong to be allowed to be heard. At times this has in fact jeopardized their commercial [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=598.58s)]
*  benefits. As a result of that position, their refusal to censor, they're not allowed in [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=605.58s)]
*  certain countries including in Brazil. I was just in France about a month ago, tried to [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=610.98s)]
*  access my own show and got that message that says Rumble's not available in France because [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=615.34s)]
*  they wouldn't remove RT and other Russian outlets that the French government demanded [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=619.38s)]
*  they remove. I guess their position is twofold. One is that in the long term we think free [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=623.58s)]
*  speech will help our commercial interests but number two, even if they don't, even if [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=629.44s)]
*  they do undermine them somewhat, we're not willing to profit by violating our own beliefs [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=633.14s)]
*  in free speech and censoring on behalf of power centers. Which of those two, or if it's [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=639.7s)]
*  any of those, do you see Substack's position as being? [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=644.48s)]
*  I do think it's both. We've designed the company to be aligned with this mission. Writers [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=650.86s)]
*  on Substack, creators on Substack are independent, they own their work, they own their connection [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=659.3000000000001s)]
*  to their audience so they can leave at any time. If we turned around one day and said, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=664.22s)]
*  ha ha ha, we've sold out for some short term profit, we're going to start censoring, we [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=669.0600000000001s)]
*  would lose all of our business. We've tried to build a company that puts us [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=673.02s)]
*  on the side of writers and thinkers who have the right to say what they think and readers [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=680.82s)]
*  and viewers who have the right to choose what to subscribe to and what to hear. I don't [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=686.2600000000001s)]
*  think that there is a conflict but it is both a commercial and a moral proposition for us. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=691.22s)]
*  Do you get pressure from investors or from people interested in the more financial side [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=696.9000000000001s)]
*  of Substack that if push comes to shove they don't want you choosing this kind of mission [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=702.34s)]
*  of free speech if it is going to undermine the financial profitability of the company? [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=708.02s)]
*  If anything the opposite. We have wonderful investors, we have wonderful employees too. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=715.38s)]
*  I think we've been at this long enough that people know what we're about, they understand [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=720.82s)]
*  the theory of what we're doing. People would not sign up to work at or invest in Substack [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=725.1s)]
*  if they didn't see these things as valuable. We're quite fortunate that we've been pretty [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=729.7s)]
*  aligned. Let's talk about the program itself, the specific subject. When I was there you [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=734.78s)]
*  started introducing programs that would support the writers including some really important [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=740.74s)]
*  support mechanisms such as if a writer gets sued by some subject that they're writing [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=746.3399999999999s)]
*  about to help them be able to have legal counsel that defends them which is incredibly important [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=750.64s)]
*  especially if you're an independent journalist. If you don't have that you could be deterred [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=755.86s)]
*  from writing about wealthy people or powerful people because of the threat that you could [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=760.2s)]
*  be sued. You began offering other kind of support services for research and the like [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=764.68s)]
*  and it's really become not just this neutral platform but a place that is designed to support [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=770.16s)]
*  the writers that you attract which is one of the reasons I think you're attracting so [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=774.48s)]
*  many. So what is this program specifically intended to do? The new one that you just [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=777.16s)]
*  unveiled? It is spiritually similar to the Defender program that you're talking about [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=782.76s)]
*  which was we noticed, the genesis of that was we noticed you're an independent journalist, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=790.0s)]
*  you're writing something about a local businessman or politician that is true or is valid journalism [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=794.52s)]
*  and they send you this legal threat in an effort to shut you down and it's basically [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=802.54s)]
*  like censorship by lawfare. So we just felt like the platform had an interest in helping [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=806.92s)]
*  defend against those kinds of activities. If it was costless to do that, if people could [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=812.4s)]
*  just be rolled over at no cost, it was going to have this massive chilling effect on everybody [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=818.48s)]
*  on sub-stack and on the internet as a whole and we feel the same about these actions. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=823.96s)]
*  It cannot be the case that people can be snatched up in America for writing an op-ed. We have [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=828.84s)]
*  to help with that where we can. We have to provide what resources we can to support. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=834.16s)]
*  We're partnering with FIRE, we're providing money in legal defense. Basically whatever [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=838.96s)]
*  we can do to help push back against specifically the threats to free speech we want to do. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=844.5600000000001s)]
*  Alright, just one last question because I found this funny too. When I was there at [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=851.5600000000001s)]
*  sub-stack and the kind of awareness of sub-stack was growing pretty significantly, it was attracting [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=857.04s)]
*  a much larger audience, a lot of writers who had a big platform previously. It wasn't just, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=865.14s)]
*  the accusation wasn't just, oh there's some sort of proto-fascist site because they're [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=870.92s)]
*  allowing a bunch of right wing people who should be banned or whatever. That was at [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=876.04s)]
*  the height of the kind of left liberal censorship regime as opposed to the one we're getting [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=880.4s)]
*  now. The other attack on it that I remember quite well came from corporate journalists [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=884.3199999999999s)]
*  because they're afraid of anything that might be a competitor to the hegemony or monopoly [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=889.28s)]
*  in our discourse that corporate journalism has and certainly sub-stack, attracting so [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=894.04s)]
*  many readers became a threat. I remember very well that the consensus was that sub-stack [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=898.96s)]
*  could ruin journalism. It was allowing all these people to write and to do journalism [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=906.1600000000001s)]
*  in quotes without any kind of editorial fact checking structure. It was just for people [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=911.88s)]
*  to kind of sound off and it was something that would erode journalism. Now, just yesterday [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=917.9200000000001s)]
*  I think it was, the New York Times has an article on sub-stack about how many refugees [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=923.28s)]
*  from corporate media who four years ago would never have been caught dead associating with [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=929.2s)]
*  sub-stack are now finding, not just going to sub-stack but finding success on sub-stack [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=934.12s)]
*  after they were basically expelled from their company for one reason or another. Do we have, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=939.34s)]
*  I think we have the New York Times screen, the New York Times article, do we have the [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=945.88s)]
*  headline? We're going to put that up there. The title is, The Loosening of American News [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=951.88s)]
*  Anchors. Don Levin, Joy Reid and Jim Acosta exiled or extricated from their networks are [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=957.56s)]
*  now on sub-stack trading sleek studios and quote pancake makeup for their living rooms. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=963.38s)]
*  And it kind of details not just that they're there but that they're finding a lot of success. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=969.8s)]
*  What do you think changed in kind of the ecosystem over the last few years that had corporate [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=974.26s)]
*  media personalities contemptuous of sub-stack, kind of scorning it to now kind of if you [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=978.92s)]
*  can't beat them you join them mentality going to sub-stack? [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=984.8s)]
*  I do think part of it's just that there is a lot of pressure on those business models. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=987.8s)]
*  That's been a tough business for a bunch of reasons. But I think the big thing is I think [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=997.2s)]
*  a lot of people, you said it before, people were worried that if you give people freedom [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=1001.68s)]
*  it's going to make the thing bad. It's going to turn into something that you don't want. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=1006.0400000000001s)]
*  It's something that can't make a good product. And I think the reverse is true. When you [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=1010.72s)]
*  set the incentives up correctly, when you give people editorial freedom, when you give [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=1014.9200000000001s)]
*  them the right to their own platform, the right to set their own standards in their [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=1018.8000000000001s)]
*  community, when you give them a viable business model for doing the work they believe in, [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=1021.5600000000001s)]
*  ultimately it works. Ultimately you can make good things and that is attracting more and [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=1026.4s)]
*  more people and I guess more size of the political spectrum is seeing the value of freedom of [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=1031.84s)]
*  speech owning your audience. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=1036.24s)]
*  Yeah, as you said people kind of like the idea of a controlled discourse until it kind [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=1037.52s)]
*  of starts coming for them. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=1041.8s)]
*  Until then the one's being controlled. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=1044.44s)]
*  Exactly, then they find the virtues of free speech. Last question actually, there's a [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=1045.72s)]
*  Hollywood reporter piece, again this is amazing to me just seeing positive corporate media [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=1050.96s)]
*  press about sub-stack because there was certainly none of that when I was there. It was quite [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=1056.56s)]
*  the contrary. But there's a Hollywood reporter article from March last month that says sub-stack [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=1059.36s)]
*  surges past five million paid subscribers thanks to video and Trump. Kind of goes on [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=1065.1599999999999s)]
*  to say that a lot of these refugees from corporate media, Jim Acosta, Mehdi Hassan, Joy Reed [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=1070.32s)]
*  are a big driver of the growth. I know some of them are doing quite well. Are you pleased [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=1075.4799999999998s)]
*  with the growth of sub-stack? Has it been kind of a continual growing as a result of [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=1080.7199999999998s)]
*  these new issues in the media? [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=1085.8s)]
*  We're thrilled. You know, more than five million paid subscriptions. The sub-stack app is growing [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=1088.88s)]
*  very quickly. You should get the app, get the rumble app too, get the sub-stack app [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=1094.0800000000002s)]
*  as well. It's going great and it's been a steady growth over years at this point and [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=1097.88s)]
*  you know we think it's working. People are hungry to take back their mind to have something [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=1104.1200000000001s)]
*  different and we're delighted that more and more people are choosing sub-stack. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=1108.48s)]
*  Alright Chris, it was great to see you. Congratulations on this initiative which I obviously not [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=1112.3200000000002s)]
*  to support but think is incredibly important. People do great work. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=1117.12s)]
*  Thank you. Thanks for everything. Have a good evening. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=1121.4399999999998s)]
*  If you're still tossing and turning all night or feeling edgy during the day, let me tell [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=1126.9599999999998s)]
*  you about CBD from CBD Distillery. Literally millions of people are turning to CBD for [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=1131.1599999999999s)]
*  relief because it works. In fact, over 90% of customers report better sleep with CBD [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUwnykUZKqQ&t=1137.1999999999998s)]
