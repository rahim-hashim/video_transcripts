# "The Globalists are the Racists:" Russian Analyst Aleksandr Dugin on the Loss of Cultural Identities
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [February 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM)
*  I keep having this phrase in my head that you said earlier about dozing Russia. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=0.0s)]
*  Russia needs a dozing. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=11.4s)]
*  As you might know, I live in Brazil, I'm American, but I live in Brazil and a half for many years. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=12.4s)]
*  And over the last two months, you have this right-wing populist movement led by Jair Bolsonaro, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=19.12s)]
*  and they talk all the time now about USAID and where money has gone because there's been [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=26.24s)]
*  a lot of USAID money into Brazil as well. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=30.119999999999997s)]
*  And you have now right-wing conferences in the United States, and they're often attended [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=34.16s)]
*  by right-wing leaders from every continent, from Europe, from South America, from everywhere. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=39.8s)]
*  And it is kind of ironic because all of these right-wing populist movements are very nationalistic [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=46.8s)]
*  in the way they describe themselves and the way you're talking about this Russian identity, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=53.559999999999995s)]
*  Russian sovereignty, Russian patriotism. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=57.12s)]
*  But at the same time, maybe because of the internet, maybe for other reasons, there seems [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=59.64s)]
*  to be a very close linkage, almost like it's like an international movement as well, where [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=63.379999999999995s)]
*  populists and nationalists are linking up together, increasingly informing a kind of [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=69.68s)]
*  worldwide movement. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=73.75999999999999s)]
*  Is that how you see Russian national movement? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=75.52s)]
*  You're very tapped into the right-wing discourse in the United States. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=78.44s)]
*  I can see that. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=81.72s)]
*  And I see that in a lot of other populist and nationalistic movements as well. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=82.72s)]
*  There's a little tension because the idea is we want an expression of our own country, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=86.64s)]
*  our own culture, our own history, our own borders, but at the same time it seems increasingly, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=90.88s)]
*  I don't want to say like globalism, but it does seem to be an internationalist movement [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=95.04s)]
*  as well. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=100.0s)]
*  Is that how you see it? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=101.0s)]
*  Yes, I agree. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=102.0s)]
*  Because that is interesting that being European, Americans, Brazilian, and Russians, we have [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=103.68s)]
*  the same threat of the loss of our identity and cancelling of our cultural values, traditions, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=112.48s)]
*  because the globalists, they promote the kind of postmodern relativism. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=125.46000000000001s)]
*  So no values, no gods, everything is optional, and there is no organic identity. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=132.89999999999998s)]
*  All identities are just the play, the game, so you could choose any identity you prefer. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=140.62s)]
*  And all the values are relative, and so there should not be national states, national culture, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=148.57999999999998s)]
*  no civilisations, only one civilisation, liberal and of history, and so on. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=157.3s)]
*  That is directed against Russia, against Russian understanding of what Russia, Holy Mother [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=162.5s)]
*  Russia is, what is our tradition, our religion, our value. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=169.42000000000002s)]
*  The same, it is against United States of America, including against those conservative part [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=174.86s)]
*  of it, very large as we see, that against majority of European population under the [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=180.85999999999999s)]
*  rule of globalists. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=188.94s)]
*  The same, I think, for Brazilian people. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=189.94s)]
*  So I see this coordination, beginning of coordination of these conservatives, and the people, I [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=193.26s)]
*  don't like term nationalist, because I am not nationalist. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=204.94s)]
*  I don't think that is good term that fits for Russia, because we had here much more [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=210.34s)]
*  a civilisation state, with different nations. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=216.18s)]
*  Not just a nation state. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=219.70000000000002s)]
*  No, absolutely, never, never a nation state. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=221.18s)]
*  Soviet Union wasn't a national state, Russian Empire wasn't a national state. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=224.06s)]
*  So nationalism, maybe for Western country, it is normal term. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=229.42000000000002s)]
*  For our country, it is the wrong term. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=235.02s)]
*  So I could not, they describe me as ultra-national, but I am not national at all. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=237.7s)]
*  So that is just irony. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=243.61999999999998s)]
*  But I think, I agree, there should be a kind of coordination between the peoples and the [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=247.1s)]
*  countries and the movements, defending their own deep identity, their own civilisational [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=253.7s)]
*  values. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=261.58s)]
*  Because there is a common enemy, as you see it, which is globalism. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=262.58s)]
*  Yes, not the West, because not China, not socialism, just globalism. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=266.18s)]
*  Globalism, it could be Islamic, it could be Chinese, it could be, it was Soviet-Russian. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=272.58s)]
*  That was the kind of globalism as well. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=278.58s)]
*  Now it is left liberal Western globalism, but all kind of globalism is bad. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=280.41999999999996s)]
*  When you say Soviet-Russian globalism, that's how it was before. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=288.41999999999996s)]
*  Communism. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=292.21999999999997s)]
*  So you were in support of the Soviet ideology to other parts of the world? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=293.42s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=297.22s)]
*  Would you oppose? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=298.22s)]
*  Yes, I was dissident in the Soviet time. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=299.22s)]
*  I was formed as traditionalist, as philosopher of conservative values. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=301.62s)]
*  That was in the beginning of 80s. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=312.66s)]
*  So 45 years ago, I started something like Conscious Life. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=314.94000000000005s)]
*  That was against this globalism of the Soviet Union, against materialism, against atheism. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=321.62s)]
*  I was in favour of restoration of Great Russia, Russia as a civilisational state. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=328.14000000000004s)]
*  I fought for that, not so much against communism, but I was against it. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=335.78000000000003s)]
*  It was youth, I didn't participate in some political movement, but ideologically I was [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=342.5s)]
*  very opposed to that. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=348.26s)]
*  When Perestroika started, I tried to get from the trap of liberalism in order to promote [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=350.86s)]
*  return to the roots, Russian roots. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=358.94s)]
*  And that I still defend the same values. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=361.82s)]
*  But I think that this kind of dialogue between different tendencies, not necessarily right, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=365.18s)]
*  not necessarily nationalist, and for sure not racist, because racism is globalism. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=372.58s)]
*  Globalists are racist because they think that there is only one civilisation, liberal one. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=378.78s)]
*  That is the superior one. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=385.02s)]
*  Yes, that is suprematism, liberal suprematism. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=386.46s)]
*  I am radically against all kinds of racism, but I think that these people who defend this [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=389.46s)]
*  civilisational identity being different for them should cooperate, should hear each other, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=401.14s)]
*  should get inside the skin of others in order to understand the perspective, for example, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=409.02s)]
*  of American patriotism, of Brazilian patriotism, Chinese, Islamic patriotism, Iranian, Jewish. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=416.21999999999997s)]
*  Nobody should be excluded from this dialogue of the people conscious about their belongingness, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=424.34s)]
*  conscious of their deep identity and defending this identity together against the globalist threat. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=435.06s)]
*  I know you're a philosopher, so just to go a little bit deeper into that first principle, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=445.34s)]
*  is the reason that you think it's beneficial or desirable for people to embrace this kind of [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=452.18s)]
*  cultural identity or whatever, religious identity, however people identify, is because naturally [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=459.42s)]
*  human beings are tribal and the sense of tribal belonging is important, or is there some other [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=470.1s)]
*  value that causes you to want to preserve that way of organising? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=474.62s)]
*  Tribe is one of the levels of the identity, the smallest level, clans, tribe. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=480.97999999999996s)]
*  There is much higher as well the other levels. I have dedicated to that my book that is translated [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=491.14s)]
*  into English, Ethnosociology, and the highest point of common identity, common destiny, common [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=499.65999999999997s)]
*  social understanding of the unity, it is civilisation. But in my opinion, that's the most important [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=509.29999999999995s)]
*  point in my philosophy, that there is not only one civilisation, but there are civilisations, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=518.78s)]
*  so in the plural. And that is the highest level. It is not tribal, not clan, not ethnic. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=525.3399999999999s)]
*  It is not national, it is something much higher, but they are very different from one to the other. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=532.06s)]
*  For example, the civilisation, Chinese civilisation, China is a civilisation state. There are many [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=539.18s)]
*  ethnical groups inside, there are many forms of life and traditional peoples and communities [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=545.5s)]
*  and societies, but there is something common. They could not read correctly hieroglyphs in the [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=557.26s)]
*  north or in the south, they are different. So that is inclusive, great civilisation, not just people [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=565.1s)]
*  or clan, they look different. So China is a continent, a universe, the same for Russia, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=572.62s)]
*  the same for United States of America, the same for Europe. So there are civilisations. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=579.98s)]
*  And there is no direct hierarchy, there is no hierarchy between them. So Indian civilisation, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=587.34s)]
*  Islamic civilisation, not Iranian, Persian, Turkic, Malaysian. These are nations and you're [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=592.9399999999999s)]
*  talking about a higher level of civilisation. Yes, absolutely. So nations could form, could be the [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=600.62s)]
*  part of civilisation, but civilisation is something that is highest unity possible. And if we imagine, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=604.9399999999999s)]
*  if we are in search of much higher level, we need to take into consideration all these civilisations. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=614.22s)]
*  So we need to ask Chinese men, how sounds the term men? What do you mean by being men? [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=623.02s)]
*  It's men in Chinese. And what are the implications? What are the basic texts you have derived [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=634.78s)]
*  this term from? The same for Islam, the same for Africa, for Latin America, for Russia, for Europe. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=642.94s)]
*  And only after taking in consideration these civilisations, civilisational claims or [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=650.7s)]
*  translations, we could arrive at some system. There will be, for example, human rights, but [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=658.94s)]
*  human rights in each civilisation, they have totally different meaning. And now we are dealing [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=667.4200000000001s)]
*  with the Western, modern, liberal understanding of what is human and what is right. And we discard [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=673.82s)]
*  totally Chinese understanding of what is juridic, the law, the Confucianism and so on. Russian, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=681.5s)]
*  Byzantine, Christian, Orthodox tradition, we don't take into consideration. So we are dealing [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=688.1400000000001s)]
*  with the products of one civilisation and not whole civilisation, because liberal globalists, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=694.46s)]
*  they represent only small part, geographical and historical, of the Western civilisation. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=702.62s)]
*  If we go deeper, we see totally different meaning of the men, of the right, during different period [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=709.1s)]
*  of the West. And if we are convinced that the most modern is the better, that is the kind of [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=716.38s)]
*  chronocentric racism, tempo-centric racism. So you discard your own ancestors, you consider them to be [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=725.66s)]
*  stupid, primitive and broken. And that is wrong. We need to respect them. We need to understand them. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=735.02s)]
*  And the most, we are dealing, for example, with Russian ancient language, it is much more rich, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=745.9s)]
*  richer than modern. So many meanings, so many forms, the same with Latin, the same with German, [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=755.18s)]
*  the same with Greek. So the ancient, that is not the primitive. It is much- [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=761.74s)]
*  In some ways, it's richer than- [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=767.74s)]
*  Yeah, richer than- [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=769.34s)]
*  Right, deeper. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=770.22s)]
*  But that is, but we need to combine them. We could not- [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=771.7399999999999s)]
*  Right, because they are still modernising in progress, but by retaining what was not discarded. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=775.9799999999999s)]
*  That's a perfect segue to what I wanted to, the last thing I wanted to ask you about, which is, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=781.42s)]
*  what you are describing, this kind of, and it was the end of history, was all about that as you [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=784.8599999999999s)]
*  referenced earlier with Fukuyama, and this globalist notion that we are going to impose on everybody [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=790.3s)]
*  and everything, our western ideals of liberalism because it is objectively superior, was possible [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=797.58s)]
*  in the wake of the fall of the Soviet Union when the United States was the superpower, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=805.34s)]
*  the unilateral world governed by one major power. And I think there is a perception now, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=810.0600000000001s)]
*  not necessarily in the United States, but around the rest of the world, that that is changing, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=815.34s)]
*  that the world is becoming far more multipolar. Obviously, the rise of China is an example of [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=820.22s)]
*  that, but also the role that Russia is playing, that the west is starting to accept, and other [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=825.18s)]
*  poles of power as well. In India, you have huge countries with very rich and powerful histories [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=830.06s)]
*  or civilisations, as you call them. Is that the direction that you think the world is going in, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=835.0999999999999s)]
*  is getting away from the unilateralism of the 90s and Bush and Obama years into a more [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=840.38s)]
*  multilateral world and do these changes that you desire inevitably accompany that? [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=846.3s)]
*  I think that we had the chance to avoid many problems if we heard [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=851.9s)]
*  Huntington, Samuel Huntington, who has suggested in the beginning of the 90s not to be, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=861.42s)]
*  not to fall into illusion of this unipolarity, not to fall into illusion of the liberal end [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=868.46s)]
*  of the history and the great glory of the west that now should lead the world and [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=875.26s)]
*  oblige everybody else to follow the same liberal agenda, individualism, human rights and so on, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=883.18s)]
*  global government. But we need to accept the fact of existence of different civilisations, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=889.8199999999999s)]
*  including Russian, Islamic, Chinese, Indian, all that now is appearing as the powerful political [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=898.54s)]
*  entities, as big spaces, as something powerful in a material way. Huntington has seen that [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=907.5799999999999s)]
*  as a concept, as the ideas. The war of civilisations, as he described it. Clash, [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=918.14s)]
*  clash, clash, but that is not important clash. Everybody take in consideration, pay attention [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=922.54s)]
*  to clash, but we need to pay attention to civilisations in plural. And that was the [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=931.0999999999999s)]
*  clash is possible, where is war, there could be peace, where there is peace, there could be war. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=937.5s)]
*  They are linked together, clash or not clash or dialogue, they are interchangeable. So the most [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=942.2199999999999s)]
*  important civilisations, and we had the chance to go that way, but we didn't go. Why not? [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=948.3s)]
*  I think that was the kind of inertia of the Cold War. So there was bipolar system based on [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=955.26s)]
*  propaganda, political concept, and when one pole disappeared, there was the other. The other [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=963.18s)]
*  didn't disappear or didn't transform. So that was the reason why NATO exists still. So why they [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=970.3s)]
*  try to find their new enemy in order to explain its being. So we, the West, went unipolar way. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=982.4599999999999s)]
*  I have spoken with one French general who has received the order after the fall of the Soviet [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=994.94s)]
*  Union in 1992 precisely to create Eurocorps, to create European army because there is no more [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=1002.3800000000001s)]
*  the threat from the East. NATO is obsolete, so we need to create European army. And he has said [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=1012.5400000000001s)]
*  that he has prepared during six months almost everything. So almost everything was ready to [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=1023.5s)]
*  that. The German... And NATO would automatically disappear because the purpose of it no longer [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=1030.86s)]
*  existed. Maybe. They thought like that because there was no threat on the East, Russia was [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=1036.86s)]
*  democratic and so on. And after six months he has received the second order. Stop that. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=1042.78s)]
*  Stop that. Destroy that. Because things work and they continue. And they, yes, and that was kind of [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=1050.94s)]
*  decisive moment to where to go either to multipolarity suggested by Huntington, and now [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=1058.1399999999999s)]
*  we are obliged to accept that. Marco Rubio has accepted that already. So we are in [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=1066.62s)]
*  multipolarity. But this multipolarity is the result of the wars, of the conflicts that they [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=1074.46s)]
*  still didn't end these wars. They continue. So that was the wrong decision. And this idea of [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=1085.42s)]
*  continuing unipolar moment, unipolar moment as Charles Krauthammer has said that, that was the [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=1094.06s)]
*  great crime against humanity. So in spite of accepting this and dealing with this [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=1101.8999999999999s)]
*  emerging civilization as Chinese, Indian, Russian, Islamic, with delicate methods to accepting their [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=1112.06s)]
*  claims, respecting their right, and carefully constructing the global reality in favor maybe [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=1123.98s)]
*  of the West, but dealing carefully with these emerging civilizations. Instead of that, that was [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=1131.9s)]
*  choosing the right to go ahead, to continue this unipolarity, to continue this Cold War, but without [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=1139.34s)]
*  without old enemy, they tried to put Islam in the place of this global enemy that failed, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=1148.22s)]
*  and finally they returned to the same old story of Cold War about how evil those Russians are. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=1156.7s)]
*  Right. I think that was the mistake, and that was crime of the Western globalist elite not hearing [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=1163.5s)]
*  Samuel Huntington. Well, ironically, you seem to be suggesting that [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=1172.06s)]
*  had they been more delicate about it, had they found a new way to deal with the world different [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=1176.06s)]
*  than how they dealt with it during the Cold War, that maybe they would have been more effective [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=1181.34s)]
*  in imposing a global order because it would have produced less of a backlash, the kind of backlash [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=1186.22s)]
*  that we're now seeing. Exactly, exactly. Maybe the West could assure its leading role in this [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=1190.3s)]
*  multipolar world, and now everybody hates the West because of this artificially prolonged [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=1197.34s)]
*  unipolar moment. More globalists insist on continuation of this unipolar moment, the more [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=1206.62s)]
*  radical backlash is and will be. And Trump, in that sense, he is wise. He is doing exactly what [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=1218.06s)]
*  the responsible, correct, European, global Western leaders should do, let the other create their [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=1228.94s)]
*  greatness, their civilization, their polls, if they can. So Trump, he doesn't promise to the other [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=1237.42s)]
*  to make them great. So it is up to us to make us great. That is why we need a Russian doji. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=1247.82s)]
*  Well, last question. And it's the perfect conclusion, I think. There was a speech, [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=1255.74s)]
*  I don't know if you saw it, I think it was in 2023 by Fiona Hill, who's a long time. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=1261.9s)]
*  Yeah, okay. So spy, spy, American spies. Yeah, she's been, you know, [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=1267.34s)]
*  up. Very, very, but she's also been a very kind of militarist person when it comes to dealing [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=1273.1s)]
*  with Russia and China. She worked in the Trump White House, but she gave a speech to a bunch of [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=1278.4599999999998s)]
*  European national security elites in 2023, where she said, Look, this may not be what I want to [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=1283.58s)]
*  tell you, but I have to tell you, because it's the reality that when we do things like fuel the war [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=1290.62s)]
*  in Ukraine, or even what the United States was doing, arming and fueling Israel's destruction of [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=1296.46s)]
*  Gaza, leaving aside the morality of it or the wisdom of it. She said, that's exactly the kind of [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=1303.74s)]
*  resentment that gets created around the world that is driving a lot of countries into the arms of [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=1310.3s)]
*  China and bricks and looking for alternatives to a unilateral world. Because there's a perception [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=1315.74s)]
*  that instead of respecting the world, we use our superior military force to bully it to get our [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=1321.3400000000001s)]
*  way. And that's inevitably going to create a backlash. It's inevitably going to push people [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=1326.3s)]
*  away from us. Do you basically agree with that framework? That's correct. This remark, this [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=1330.22s)]
*  observation is totally correct. But it was just bizarre to hear it from her since she... There is [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=1334.78s)]
*  only difference. So there is multilateralism and multipolarity. Multilateralism is based on the [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=1341.26s)]
*  idea there is only one truth, and that is Western modern liberal truth, but you need to [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=1348.94s)]
*  hide that. You need to trick the other, not necessarily cheat, but to make the image [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=1355.98s)]
*  that you respect them because they are savage, that you should respect, you should treat them [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=1366.6200000000001s)]
*  carefully in order to promote your agenda. It is multilateralism. And there is multipolarity [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=1372.3000000000002s)]
*  that is based on the sincere faith that there are different civilizations that we could not [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=1379.5s)]
*  compare between each other. They have their own measures inside of them. They have, all of them [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=1386.86s)]
*  have their proper vision of what is time, what is life, what is soul, what is God, what is space. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=1394.46s)]
*  And if you accept this sincerely, this plurality of civilizations, that is not about leadership, [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=1402.54s)]
*  that is about humanity. So that is new, not so much realistic, but idealistic vision. So I think [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=1409.82s)]
*  that is difference. Multipolarity is very, very sincere and very loyal to the principle of this [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=1417.6599999999999s)]
*  multipolarity. Smallest group of people, of tribe, could have their own universe. We shouldn't [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=1427.98s)]
*  we shouldn't educate them how it is in the reality because in their reality it is so. So that we [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=1434.7s)]
*  should apply to civilization a kind of anthropological approach. That respects diversity. Yes, absolutely. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=1442.38s)]
*  Diversity and universes and differences and the thing that could seem to us to be weird or strange, [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=1451.3400000000001s)]
*  we shouldn't judge them because for them maybe what we do seems very, very strange. So that is [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=1460.8600000000001s)]
*  diversity and real pluralism of civilizations. So that is the principle, that is philosophy. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=1468.7s)]
*  And I think Fiona Hugh just thinks how better to rule. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=1476.22s)]
*  For sure, it was just a strategic point that she was making, not a broader moral or ethical one, [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=1481.82s)]
*  but one that I think nonetheless Europeans needed to hear. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=1486.38s)]
*  Yes, but she is right. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=1489.26s)]
*  Yeah. Well, Professor, thank you so much. This has been very interesting and I really [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3EFwF7ZIM&t=1490.8600000000001s)]
