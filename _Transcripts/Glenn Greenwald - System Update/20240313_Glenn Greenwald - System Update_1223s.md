# REMINDER: This Bipartisan Push to Ban TikTok Is *Not* About Chinese Spying
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [March 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU)
*  I'd be willing to bet a lot of money that there are a lot of you who believe this, who [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=0.0s)]
*  believe that TikTok is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, that the censorship or content [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=10.76s)]
*  moderation decisions they make are designed to manipulate young Americans into hating [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=16.8s)]
*  their government and fighting with one another, just like we were told the Russians do. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=23.62s)]
*  We're constantly told the Russians are trying to infiltrate social media, to turn us against [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=28.44s)]
*  each other, to create division. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=32.32s)]
*  That was for a long time the reason more social media censorship was needed to prevent the [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=34.4s)]
*  scary Russians from dividing us. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=40.32s)]
*  Now they've added China to it, knowing that a lot of people aren't afraid of Russia, that [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  the Russiagate hoax proved to be a fraud. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=47.6s)]
*  They've now switched the fear mongering to China. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  And I know there are a lot of people who oppose the war in Ukraine, the US role in the war [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=52.36s)]
*  in Ukraine, who know Russiagate is a fraud, who say no, Russia is not an enemy of China. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=57.28s)]
*  That's who we really have to be afraid of. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=61.6s)]
*  Now what happened was, I actually did a lot of investigation and research into this because [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=65.8s)]
*  I wrote about it here in December of 2022 when I was still at Substack, reflecting new [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=70.64s)]
*  US control of TikTok censorship, our report criticizing Zelensky was deleted. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=76.84s)]
*  What happened was, we produced a segment on our show here that was very critical of President [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=83.24000000000001s)]
*  Zelensky and of the Ukrainian government and the war effort of the United States in Ukraine. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=90.76s)]
*  And it got, went pretty viral. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=96.32000000000001s)]
*  A lot of people were spreading it around and watching it. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=98.24000000000001s)]
*  And then suddenly, very quickly, it got banned, taken down by TikTok that sent us a note saying, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=101.16s)]
*  this video is a violation of our terms of service. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=107.36s)]
*  And of course, I thought to myself, okay, I kept hearing that China censors to [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=111.92s)]
*  propagandize Americans against their government. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=117.84s)]
*  So why would they want to delete my video critical of the US government? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=119.76s)]
*  Why would they want to protect the US government from my criticism of it? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=124.08s)]
*  Why would they want to protect the US government's war effort in Ukraine by banning critiques of it? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=127.44s)]
*  That doesn't make any sense, does it? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=134.08s)]
*  Just like it doesn't make sense that TikTok banned mention of the Bin Laden letter. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=135.48s)]
*  And we went and investigated what actually was going on. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=141.52s)]
*  And it turns out that what's really going on, I'm going to show you the evidence and [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=145.20000000000002s)]
*  you can make your own decision, is that the CIA and the FBI have taken the position they [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=149.8s)]
*  want TikTok banned. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=154.76000000000002s)]
*  The people who own TikTok, who are the founders of TikTok, the main founder in particular, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=159.0s)]
*  is someone who was born in Singapore. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=166.76000000000002s)]
*  He went to the London School of Economics. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=168.28s)]
*  He then went to Harvard Business School. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=171.28s)]
*  He's a capitalist. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=173.56s)]
*  He's trying to get wealthy. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=174.56s)]
*  He's getting rich. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=175.96s)]
*  He's the founder of TikTok. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=176.96s)]
*  And the US is an incredibly lucrative market for TikTok that they don't want to lose access [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=179.68s)]
*  to because it would cost them billions of dollars in valuation in their company. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=184.28s)]
*  They're now trying to compete with Amazon and have e-commerce on that site. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=189.28s)]
*  It's a gold mine. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=194.16s)]
*  And so they're desperate not to get banned from the United States. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=196.8s)]
*  And so they've told the CIA and the FBI, look, we don't care about political censorship. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=200.28s)]
*  We'll turn that over to you. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=204.92s)]
*  We'll let you tell us what you want censored in order for us to stay in the United States. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=206.32s)]
*  And that is what's been happening. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=213.36s)]
*  The US security state has been gradually commandeering the ability to content moderate on TikTok [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=216.64s)]
*  as a condition for allowing TikTok to remain in the United States. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=227.36s)]
*  So here is the article we wrote. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=233.4s)]
*  For years, US officials and their media allies accused Russia, China, and Iran of tyranny [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=234.60000000000002s)]
*  for demanding censorship as a condition for big tech access. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=239.92000000000002s)]
*  That's what China and Iran and Russia do. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=242.72000000000003s)]
*  They say, hey, Google and Facebook, you can only come in our country if you agree to censor [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=245.20000000000002s)]
*  as we command. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=249.72000000000003s)]
*  That's what Brazil is doing as well to Facebook and Google and Twitter. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=250.72000000000003s)]
*  We'll let you be in our country, but only if you censor as we demand. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=254.88s)]
*  And Facebook, Google, and Twitter want access to the Brazilian market. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=257.96s)]
*  It's a huge market. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=264.24s)]
*  And so they censor as the Brazilian government tells them to. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=266.12s)]
*  Elon Musk had a controversy because right before the Indian election, the Indian government [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=270.88s)]
*  told Twitter, we want all these accounts banned. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=274.76s)]
*  And Elon Musk banned them. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=278.44s)]
*  And when he was criticized over it, he said, well, look, you're not going to lose access [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=279.8s)]
*  to India, a gigantic democracy. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=283.44s)]
*  Of course, I'm going to censor as the government tells me to if the threat is if I don't, I'll [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=285.88s)]
*  be banned from their market. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=291.0s)]
*  That's what the United States is doing to TikTok. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=292.96s)]
*  It's telling them, we're going to ban you from our country unless you censor the way [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=294.56s)]
*  we want. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=299.48s)]
*  We know that the United States government is very interested in controlling the flow [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=300.8s)]
*  of information on big tech. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=303.64s)]
*  That's what the Twitter files were about. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=305.24s)]
*  They were doing that with Facebook and Google and Twitter. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=307.0s)]
*  And of course, they're doing that with TikTok as well. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=309.6s)]
*  And so here's what we wrote. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=313.52000000000004s)]
*  Quote, concerns over China's ability to manipulate US public opinion were based on claims that [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=314.52000000000004s)]
*  China was banning content on TikTok that was contrary to Beijing's interest. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=319.84000000000003s)]
*  Western media outlets were specifically alleging that the Chinese government itself was censoring [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=326.12s)]
*  TikTok to ban any content that the CCP regarded as threatening to its national security and [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=329.6s)]
*  internal order. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=335.28000000000003s)]
*  Other than ban TikTok from the US, the US security state is now doing exactly that [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=337.32s)]
*  which China does to the US, to US tech companies, namely requiring that as a condition to maintaining [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=341.04s)]
*  access to the American market, TikTok must now censor content that undermines what those [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=346.62s)]
*  agencies view, the CIA, the FBI, the DHS, as undermining American national security [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=352.76s)]
*  interests. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=358.4s)]
*  TikTok, desperate not to lose access to hundreds of millions of Americans, has been making [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=359.4s)]
*  a series of significant concessions to appease the Pentagon, CIA, and FBI, the agencies [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=363.64s)]
*  most opposed to deals that allow TikTok to stay in the US. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=370.36s)]
*  Among those concessions is that TikTok is now outsourcing what the US government calls [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=373.36s)]
*  content moderation, a pleasant sounding euphemism for political censorship, to groups controlled [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=379.32s)]
*  by the US government. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=385.08s)]
*  And this is a report from Reuters. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=387.59999999999997s)]
*  Quote, TikTok has already unveiled several measures aimed at appeasing the US government [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=389.2s)]
*  including an agreement for Oracle Corporation to store the data of the apps users in the [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=394.48s)]
*  United States and a United States Data Security Division, part of the US government, to oversee [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=399.08s)]
*  data protection and content moderation decisions. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=405.36s)]
*  It has spent $1.5 billion on hiring and reorganization costs to build up that unit according to a [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=409.44s)]
*  source familiar with the matter. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=415.24s)]
*  TikTok has been hiring away from Facebook, from Instagram, all their security state executives [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=417.72s)]
*  who had overseen censorship for Facebook and for Google and putting them in charge of content [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=423.6s)]
*  moderation and TikTok to show the US government we're going to censor the way you want just [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=428.52000000000004s)]
*  like Facebook and Google do as a condition to allowing us access to your market. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=432.52000000000004s)]
*  Keep an open mind on this. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=439.12s)]
*  Whenever government officials start trying to scare you and then in conjunction with [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=441.16s)]
*  say now that we put you in fear of China and what they're doing on TikTok, give us the [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=445.44s)]
*  power to censor what your kids can and can't hear or what adults can and can't hear. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=449.59999999999997s)]
*  Be open minded to what actually is happening at least. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=454.84s)]
*  It was the White House that first demanded TikTok be banned. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=461.08s)]
*  It was Karine Jopierre, the White House press secretary who did so in March of this year. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=465.24s)]
*  And when she did, a TikTok user named Luke David Johnson produced a video. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=473.5s)]
*  He's a prominent TikTok user. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=481.3s)]
*  He's not a child. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=483.3s)]
*  He's not a young adult. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=484.3s)]
*  He looks to be in his 30s or 40s. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=485.3s)]
*  He produced a video explaining why it's so dangerous to allow the Biden White House to [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=487.94s)]
*  try and ban TikTok. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=492.74s)]
*  And I'm going to show you this video because he lays out the argument very clearly and [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=493.74s)]
*  very persuasively. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=499.06s)]
*  And I hope it'll just at least have people keep an open mind. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=501.18s)]
*  A question on TikTok. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=503.98s)]
*  Over 100 million people now use this app. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=505.98s)]
*  What is your message to them about why you're so concerned? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=509.98s)]
*  The way she casually thumbs through her notebook without even looking at the pages, knowing [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=514.3s)]
*  there's nothing in there that's going to help her with probably the most important question [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=520.06s)]
*  anyone has asked her in weeks. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=524.62s)]
*  As she tries to act like it's just some run of the mill question. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=527.8s)]
*  Oh, by the way, TikTok. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=531.58s)]
*  You're the press secretary. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=535.58s)]
*  You're all things media. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=536.94s)]
*  You're obsessed with the media. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=538.3s)]
*  TikTok has 100 million users that use it for 90 minutes a day. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=539.94s)]
*  You know this is huge. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=544.14s)]
*  She tries to play it down like it's practically nothing. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=546.2s)]
*  He said he wasn't sure if the US should ban TikTok when he was asked about this. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=548.2s)]
*  The key part of that, like it usually is, what changed? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=553.1800000000001s)]
*  I'll tell you what changed. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=568.62s)]
*  TikTok didn't start collecting any kind of data that it wasn't already collecting before. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=570.5s)]
*  It's also not collecting data that a million other companies don't harvest and sell in [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=574.7s)]
*  nice, tight, neat little packages to all kinds of people around the world which are freely [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=579.82s)]
*  available. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=585.5s)]
*  I don't think that China went out of its way to create an app in order to track and monitor [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=586.5s)]
*  stuff that's widely available on the market already. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=591.58s)]
*  It would have been a lot more cost effective for them to just go buy it. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=594.5s)]
*  But what they did do was give Americans the ability to communicate with each other. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=598.6600000000001s)]
*  And what has been happening, as she mentioned, there's 100 million users now, 90 minutes [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=603.2600000000001s)]
*  today, using this platform to communicate with each other. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=608.18s)]
*  That is a huge threat. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=612.8599999999999s)]
*  And not to the Americans, not to the individuals who are communicating their ideas to one another, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=614.5999999999999s)]
*  but to the administration in power. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=620.8599999999999s)]
*  And that's why this is a bipartisan bill that she's so proud to keep pointing out. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=623.12s)]
*  It's bipartisan because both parties in power agree that it's dangerous for the American [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=628.38s)]
*  people to communicate their ideas to one another without their control. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=634.66s)]
*  See, it's fine when it's the mainstream media that they have control over. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=639.62s)]
*  It's fine when it's Twitter and Facebook and other companies that they have control over. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=644.0999999999999s)]
*  But it's not fine when it's a company they don't have control over. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=648.42s)]
*  Twitter was okay before, now Twitter's a problem because it's no longer controlled by the US [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=652.0999999999999s)]
*  government. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=657.6999999999999s)]
*  See how this works? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=658.6999999999999s)]
*  This is probably the biggest question she's ever been asked in her career. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=659.6999999999999s)]
*  And she has to know it. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=663.76s)]
*  She's a press secretary of the United States of America. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=665.4799999999999s)]
*  TikTok is a really big deal. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=670.4399999999999s)]
*  It's way bigger than any conversation they've ever had from that podium about anything. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=672.3199999999999s)]
*  So do you see what he's saying? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=679.76s)]
*  He's saying the United States government has worked very hard to make sure it controls [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=682.64s)]
*  all important means of communication. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=688.06s)]
*  It obviously has the US media in the palm of its hands. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=689.8s)]
*  The US media reports what the CIA and the FBI tell it to and doesn't report what they [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=693.4s)]
*  tell it not to say. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=700.5999999999999s)]
*  The big tech platforms, Facebook and Google and Twitter before Elon Musk, as we know, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=703.1999999999999s)]
*  were subject to constant orders from the government about what to censor and they did it. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=709.1999999999999s)]
*  And the reason they're so fixated on Elon Musk and the reason they hate Rumble and any [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=716.32s)]
*  other site that doesn't obey them is because they can't stand the notion that Americans [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=721.12s)]
*  can go on a platform and communicate ideas that they can't stop. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=726.36s)]
*  And this is what the threats to ban TikTok are about, is about trying to have the American [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=732.6s)]
*  government be able to commandeer those censorship decisions so that critical videos of Zelensky [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=738.48s)]
*  and the war in Ukraine or videos about the Bin Laden letter get censored because the [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=746.12s)]
*  US government wants it to and they can easily get Google and Facebook to censor it. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=752.24s)]
*  It's a little harder with TikTok. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=756.2s)]
*  And TikTok has had to agree more and more because they don't care about political censorship. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=759.32s)]
*  They care about profit. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=764.88s)]
*  These are capitalists. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=766.0s)]
*  They don't care about giving the US government control over content moderation. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=769.5s)]
*  They're happy to do it. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=774.0s)]
*  But that's the condition they have to meet in order to keep access to the very lucrative [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=775.92s)]
*  US market. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=780.52s)]
*  Here is TikTok constantly reassuring the United States and the US government TikTok's commitment [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=782.28s)]
*  to US national security. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=788.92s)]
*  They are saying here that their commitment is to US national security. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=792.0799999999999s)]
*  Put simply Project Texas, which is the TikTok project to hand over control of data and content [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=798.3199999999999s)]
*  moderation to American agencies and companies is an unprecedented initiative dedicated [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=805.58s)]
*  to making every American on TikTok feel safe with confidence their data is secure and the [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=811.5s)]
*  platform is free from outside influence. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=815.98s)]
*  This is the thing about this idea that the Chinese are spying on us with TikTok. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=817.62s)]
*  As Luke Johnson said, leaving aside how much Facebook and Google spy on us, how much data [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=823.22s)]
*  have about you and me and everybody. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=828.1800000000001s)]
*  We covered before about how the CIA and the FBI buy on the open market enormous amounts [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=832.38s)]
*  of data about Americans that are for sale that have been bundled that they would be [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=838.66s)]
*  prohibited constitutionally from collecting on their own, but they buy it commercially [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=845.0600000000001s)]
*  instead. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=849.02s)]
*  And if the goal of the Chinese government was to spy on Americans and gather data about [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=851.82s)]
*  Americans, it would be much more cost effective to just go buy it on the open market rather [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=857.26s)]
*  than having to create this whole entire app and attract Americans to use it. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=861.74s)]
*  But the condition for TikTok to remain in America has been to hand over control of content [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=867.66s)]
*  moderation decisions and data to the US government and that's exactly what they're doing. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=871.58s)]
*  Here's more from TikTok. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=878.3s)]
*  Our content moderation systems and processes, both machine and human, will always be subject [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=879.62s)]
*  to outside review to ensure that moderation is taking place only in accordance with our [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=884.82s)]
*  published community guidelines. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=889.6600000000001s)]
*  The USDS will implement these rules and the TTP, American based trusted technology provider, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=892.0600000000001s)]
*  will have full visibility guaranteeing that there are no expected changes to our system. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=899.9000000000001s)]
*  So all promotional decisions will be as transparent and audible to third party monitors and US [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=906.72s)]
*  Content Advisory Council. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=911.7800000000001s)]
*  Here is Bloomberg, or rather Reuters in June of 2023. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=915.1s)]
*  I'm sorry, yeah, it was Bloomberg in May of 2023. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=924.22s)]
*  TikTok will soon grant Oracle full access to their code and algorithm. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=928.74s)]
*  TikTok will soon grant Oracle Corporation full access to its source code, algorithm, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=934.5s)]
*  and content moderation material as part of efforts to alleviate national security concerns [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=938.74s)]
*  about the app. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=942.74s)]
*  Here from Reuters, TikTok moves US user's data to Oracle servers. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=943.82s)]
*  TikTok had previously been storing its US user data at its own data centers in Virginia [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=948.78s)]
*  with a backup in Singapore. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=953.1s)]
*  It will now delete private data on US users from its own data centers and rely fully on [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=955.02s)]
*  Oracle's US servers, it said. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=959.74s)]
*  TikTok has also set up a dedicated US data security team known as USDS as a gatekeeper [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=962.46s)]
*  for US user information and ring fencing it from ByteDance, a company spokesman told Reuters. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=967.2s)]
*  Now I understand that if you are just somebody who thinks China is the only threat, the biggest [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=975.72s)]
*  threat, even bigger than Hamas, and everything connected to China, where the Chinese mention [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=985.44s)]
*  you get very scared and you're ready to give the government all power. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=993.44s)]
*  I know this all seems with TikTok saying they're going to hand over content moderation decisions [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=997.44s)]
*  to the US security state, oh I don't believe China, China will say anything to get access [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=1001.96s)]
*  to us. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=1005.8000000000001s)]
*  But again there's 100 million Americans, 100 million Americans, one out of every three [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=1007.5600000000001s)]
*  Americans that use this app voluntarily. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=1011.6400000000001s)]
*  The proof that TikTok is actually making decisions to censor in accordance with what the US government [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=1018.4399999999999s)]
*  wants is very clear, we just showed you some. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=1026.2s)]
*  Dave Smith, who I think is one of the smartest commentators around, went on Joe Rogan's program [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=1029.8s)]
*  last week to talk about the Israel-Gaza war and he brought up the controversy with the [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=1035.72s)]
*  Bin Laden letter and watch this what happened here. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=1042.24s)]
*  In the same way, you know like the other week that Osama Bin Laden's letter to America went [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=1048.32s)]
*  like super viral on TikTok and then they scrubbed it off of The Guardian as a response to it, [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=1052.24s)]
*  which is just number one, doesn't that just say everything about our society, is that [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=1057.56s)]
*  that's the response, to scrub it off The Guardian? [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=1062.32s)]
*  Take it down so people can't see it. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=1066.32s)]
*  The Guardian being the newspaper covered it? [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=1068.32s)]
*  They had published it and it had been up there I think since. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=1070.96s)]
*  And they were concerned that it was encouraging people to support it? [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=1074.96s)]
*  Yeah, like a bunch of TikTokers, like young lefty TikTokers started making these videos [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=1078.48s)]
*  where they're like Osama Bin Laden was right about everything and then they were getting [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=1083.56s)]
*  heat for it so they just took it down. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=1087.2s)]
*  I mean you can still find it on the archives and stuff. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=1088.8400000000001s)]
*  But still a lot of people's videos are still up, right? [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=1090.8s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know about that, I'm not on TikTok, I kind of just saw on Twitter when [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=1093.68s)]
*  people were sharing the TikTok videos so I don't know if they were taking them down. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=1098.12s)]
*  I know TikTok takes down stuff pretty quickly, but I don't know what they were doing with that. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=1101.3999999999999s)]
*  I don't know, why would they take that down though? [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=1106.76s)]
*  If I was a Chinese run propaganda corporation. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=1108.6s)]
*  TikTok removes hashtag for Osama Bin Laden's letter to America after viral videos circulate. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=1112.8s)]
*  So it did just remove the hashtag. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=1118.08s)]
*  The Guardian also pulled the text of the Al-Qaeda founder. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=1120.08s)]
*  Do you see what just happened there? [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=1123.2399999999998s)]
*  Joe Rogan had been hearing and got convinced that TikTok is this propaganda weapon of the [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=1126.28s)]
*  Chinese Communist Party. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=1130.8400000000001s)]
*  They use it to disseminate information that corrupts Americans and he's like why would [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=1132.3600000000001s)]
*  TikTok possibly ever ban the Osama Bin Laden letter from being discussed? [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=1137.76s)]
*  They must love the Osama Bin Laden letter. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=1142.64s)]
*  It turns Americans against each other. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=1144.32s)]
*  They would never ban it and then suddenly appears on the screen a news story that says [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=1146.1200000000001s)]
*  TikTok banned the hashtag to the Bin Laden letter which prevents people from seeing it. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=1150.28s)]
*  Joe Rogan said, oh I guess they did. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=1155.6000000000001s)]
*  And then he tried to kind of minimize it and say, oh they only banned the hashtag. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=1157.48s)]
*  Banning the hashtag is a huge deal because that's how people search for it and then they [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=1161.72s)]
*  can't find it. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=1165.0400000000002s)]
*  But they went much further than that TikTok did. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=1167.8000000000002s)]
*  But you see Joe Rogan in his mind has been told so many times or absorbed, oh there's [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=1169.52s)]
*  a Chinese Communist Party site. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=1173.5600000000002s)]
*  They're not going to ban the Bin Laden letter. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=1175.0800000000002s)]
*  They would spread that. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=1178.72s)]
*  They would love that. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=1179.8400000000001s)]
*  But they did ban it because the minute the U.S. government tells TikTok we don't like [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=1181.12s)]
*  what you're allowing on the site, TikTok bans it as a condition to staying in the United [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=1185.86s)]
*  States. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=1189.12s)]
*  And the United States security state is gaining more and more control over what appears on [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNNYhLZ0IXU&t=1190.12s)]
