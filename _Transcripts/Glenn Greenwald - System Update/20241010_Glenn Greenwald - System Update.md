# Nord Stream "Mystery" SOLVED?
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [October 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM)
*  All right, we just wanted to give you an update on a story that we have covered for a long [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=0.0s)]
*  time but that has been mostly forgotten and we haven't covered it for a while either. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=9.94s)]
*  As you recall, in late 2022, a pipeline that was built by Russia and Germany to connect [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=14.76s)]
*  Russia and Germany with the idea of allowing Russia to sell cheap natural gas to Western [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=22.64s)]
*  Europe through Germany, a massive pipeline that took a lot of money and a long time to [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=30.04s)]
*  build was exploded. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=35.32s)]
*  It was just blown up and rendered unusable. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=38.16s)]
*  It was just sitting at the bottom of the sea. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=40.88s)]
*  And aside from being an act of extreme industrial terrorism, you just blow up a gas infrastructure [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=44.08s)]
*  and oil infrastructure that also it was a major environmental disaster. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=50.32s)]
*  Remember how we're supposed to care about the environment? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=56.28s)]
*  This is one of the worst environmental disasters in years with all kinds of natural gas leaking [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=57.8s)]
*  from that platform that was transmitting huge amounts back and forth. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=63.74s)]
*  And amazingly, at the time when this question arose, oh, who might have done this? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=69.52s)]
*  Who might have blown up this Nord Stream 2 pipeline? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=74.4s)]
*  Just remember that the US, even before the war in Ukraine, wanted that pipeline gone. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=76.8s)]
*  In fact, it was Trump, despite always being accused of being a Russian agent, who led [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=83.28s)]
*  the way in trying to badger the Germans in Western Europe, Europeans from not buying [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=88.28s)]
*  natural gas from Russia by saying, we pay for your defense. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=93.67999999999999s)]
*  Why should you buy gas from Russia instead of from us? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=98.47999999999999s)]
*  And their answer was, well, it's much cheaper to buy it from Russia. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=102.8s)]
*  Russia's much closer. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=105.36s)]
*  Their natural gas is produced more cheaply. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=106.52s)]
*  But Trump said, we don't care. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=109.28s)]
*  We're paying for your defense. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=110.46s)]
*  You should buy it from us, even if it's more expensive. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=111.53999999999999s)]
*  So the US hated this pipeline for a while. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=114.28s)]
*  When Biden got into office on this wave of anti-Russian hatred, and then the war in Ukraine [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=117.34s)]
*  started, they basically explicitly, Biden and Victoria Nuland came out and said, if [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=122.64s)]
*  the Russians invade Ukraine, you can say goodbye to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=127.08s)]
*  So the US threatened repeatedly in public to blow it up. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=130.92s)]
*  And then nine months later, when it was blown up, the Western media was like, oh my God, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=135.39999999999998s)]
*  who might have done this? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=139.48s)]
*  A gigantic mystery. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=140.48s)]
*  Could be anybody. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=143.6s)]
*  In fact, as we're about to show you, they tried to imply strongly that a leading suspect [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=144.6s)]
*  was Putin, that for some reason Putin decided to blow up his own pipeline, the one the Russians [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=151.2s)]
*  built, the one on which the Russians were relying for their future economic prosperity [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=157.56s)]
*  for decades to come. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=162.0s)]
*  That might have been just Putin who blew it up. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=163.0s)]
*  Seymour Hersh, who is one of the most decorated journalists on the planet, if not the most [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=167.72s)]
*  decorated, he's won two Pulitzer Prizes for his reporting about massacres in Vietnam and [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=172.04s)]
*  then Abu Ghraib. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=178.04s)]
*  I think he's won six Polk Awards for investigative reporting more than any other person. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=179.48000000000002s)]
*  At the time, based on his decades-long Rolodex of deeply implanted sources in the intelligence [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=186.28s)]
*  agency that it was the United States that was responsible. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=196.36s)]
*  Here's his article back in February of 2023. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=202.0s)]
*  He said how America took out the Nord Stream pipeline. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=206.04000000000002s)]
*  The New York Times called it a quote mystery. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=208.4s)]
*  But the United States executed a covert sea operation that was kept secret until now when [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=210.72000000000003s)]
*  he kind of detailed what he had learned. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=215.04s)]
*  And of course, all the people in the know, still in the corporate media who haven't been [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=218.76s)]
*  expelled like Seymour Hersh, who don't have a tiny infinitesimal fraction of the journalistic [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=223.0s)]
*  achievements he has and wouldn't compile a fraction of it even if they lived to be a [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=228.78s)]
*  thousand years old, all mocked him and said that was some weird conspiracy theory. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=233.16s)]
*  Today there was a report from a publication called Politiken, which is an outlet in Scandinavia, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=238.6s)]
*  which is where a lot of these investigations were taking place. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=249.88s)]
*  And in fact, it took place right off a Danish island. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=252.79999999999998s)]
*  That was where the pipeline was blown up. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=256.04s)]
*  And so it was the Danish conducting the investigation. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=257.84s)]
*  And up until now, the Danish have refused to release the findings of that investigation. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=260.88s)]
*  And I wonder why. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=267.12s)]
*  Probably not because they found that Putin did it. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=268.84000000000003s)]
*  It must be because it contains conclusions that would be damaging to the West. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=273.0s)]
*  But here today from that publication, it's actually from last week, it's September 26, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=278.88s)]
*  2024, it was published in the original Danish and it's now been translated. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=283.96s)]
*  The title, A Small Danish Island Got Caught in a Major Political Sabotage Case, quote, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=288.52s)]
*  In September 2022, the explosions of the Nord Stream gas pipelines attracted enormous [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=293.88s)]
*  international attention. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=299.6s)]
*  At first, everyone believed Russia was behind the sabotage. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=301.04s)]
*  Let me say, not everyone. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=304.92s)]
*  A lot of us knew that was completely idiotic and scoffed at it and laughed at it as one [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=307.56s)]
*  of the dumbest pieces of propaganda imaginable. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=312.28s)]
*  But a lot of people did believe that Russia was somehow behind the sabotage. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=315.4s)]
*  The article goes on, but now Germany is searching for a Ukrainian diving group on a pleasure [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=320.0s)]
*  yacht while Denmark and Sweden have closed their investigations. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=325.23999999999995s)]
*  Quote, It's a huge case and the biggest act of terror in this area since World War II, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=329.68s)]
*  said Sorin Thein Andersen, Administrator of Kristiansu. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=335.88s)]
*  In the beginning, we didn't know what the police were looking for and there were no [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=340.35999999999996s)]
*  ship names to relate to. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=343.21999999999997s)]
*  But it does affect us, of course, if there has been a boat with explosives right over [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=345.32s)]
*  there without us noticing anything. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=350.48s)]
*  On the phone, that was a quote from Anne-Marie Koford, on the phone her husband, the harbor [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=354.76s)]
*  master John Anchor Nielsen, said he provided the police with information from the payment [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=360.12s)]
*  machine where ships dock. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=364.98s)]
*  But the machine contains no names and he only spoke with the police a few times. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=367.28s)]
*  A journalist also showed the harbor master a picture that didn't ring any bells. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=371.76s)]
*  For the first few days, the harbor master claimed he, quote, wasn't allowed to say a [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=375.92s)]
*  word. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=379.32s)]
*  But today, John Anchor Nielsen can reveal that four or five days before the Nord Stream [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=381.59999999999997s)]
*  explosion he was with the rescue service from Kristiansum because there were some ships [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=386.84s)]
*  there and the radios were turned off. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=393.68s)]
*  It turned out that they were U.S. Navy ships. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=396.96s)]
*  When the rescue service approached them, he was asked by the naval command to turn back. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=402.09999999999997s)]
*  Therefore the harbor master leans toward the theory, as suggested by, among others, the [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=406.08s)]
*  American star journalist Seymour Hersh, although without evidence, that the U.S. was behind [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=410.35999999999996s)]
*  the sabotage. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=416.0s)]
*  Now at first they tried to blame the Russians, but then they tried to pretend that it was [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=419.36s)]
*  the Ukrainians. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=427.28000000000003s)]
*  Let me just say the country that has the greatest interest in this besides Russia is Germany. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=428.28000000000003s)]
*  It was a shared pipeline between the two countries. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=432.52000000000004s)]
*  The Germans built a lot of it. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=434.48s)]
*  They invested a lot of it. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=436.24s)]
*  They were depending upon it to provide them with natural gas, cheap natural gas. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=437.72s)]
*  Whoever blew up the pipeline committed an act of industrial sabotage and terrorism against [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=443.48s)]
*  And yet the Germans, being kind of like the British, always just very compliant, complicit, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=448.59999999999997s)]
*  being told what to do, have expressed no real interest in finding out who did it, probably [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=455.84s)]
*  because they already know who did it. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=460.59999999999997s)]
*  Here is the Wall Street Journal in August, just a couple months ago. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=463.44s)]
*  Quote, a drunken evening, a rented yacht, the real story of a Nord Street pipeline sabotage. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=467.32s)]
*  Quote, private businessmen funded the shoestring operation, which was overseen by a top general. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=473.52000000000004s)]
*  President Zelensky approved the plan, then tried unsuccessfully to call it off. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=478.84000000000003s)]
*  So they started to blame a rogue unit of Ukrainians who didn't even have the approval of President [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=482.88s)]
*  Zelensky. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=490.32000000000005s)]
*  Quote, the Ukrainian operation cost around $300,000, according to people who participated [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=491.32000000000005s)]
*  in it. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=496.32000000000005s)]
*  It involved a small rental yacht with a six-member crew, including trained civilian divers. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=497.32000000000005s)]
*  One was a woman whose presence helped create the illusion that they were a group of friends [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=502.36s)]
*  on a pleasure cruise. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=506.36s)]
*  Quote, I always laugh when I read media speculation about some huge operation involving secret [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=507.36s)]
*  services, submarines, drones, and satellites. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=512.4s)]
*  One officer who was involved in the plot said, quote, the whole thing was born out of a night [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=515.2s)]
*  of heavy boozing and the iron determination of a handful of people who had their guts [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=518.66s)]
*  to risk their lives for their country. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=523.84s)]
*  By November 2022, German investigators believed Ukrainians were behind the explosion. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=526.16s)]
*  Ukrainian officials who participated in or are familiar with the plot to believe it would [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=531.32s)]
*  be impossible to put any of the commanding officers on trial because no evidence exists [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=535.2s)]
*  beyond conversations among top officials who were at least initially all in agreement about [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=539.84s)]
*  wanting to blow up the pipeline. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=544.08s)]
*  Quote, none of them will testify unless they incriminate themselves, one former officer [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=545.7600000000001s)]
*  said. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=549.88s)]
*  So apparently, according to that theory that they tried to push, it was a tiny little band [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=552.7600000000001s)]
*  of drunken Ukrainians who on their own just decided to take a little boat, dive under [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=559.44s)]
*  the water, and engage in this extremely complex task of blowing up a very sophisticated underwater [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=564.96s)]
*  pipeline built by two industrialized countries, Russia and Germany, and simply nobody can [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=573.22s)]
*  prosecute them because no one has any evidence. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=579.2s)]
*  And according to that article, the Germans believed that it was the Ukrainians who did [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=582.58s)]
*  it and yet rather than punish Ukraine, the normal thing for a country to do if another [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=585.76s)]

*  blame for having blown up their pipeline. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=602.2s)]
*  Just to give you a little reminder of the just preposterous propaganda to which we were [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=607.36s)]
*  subjected when this happened early on. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=612.16s)]
*  Here was from the BBC in May of 2023 titled Nord Stream. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=614.6s)]
*  Report put Russian Navy ships near the pipeline blast site. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=619.1s)]
*  There were Russian Navy ships, we were told, not American ones that we just learned, but [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=624.48s)]
*  Russian Navy ships near the pipeline blast site. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=627.8s)]
*  Quote, underwater explosions last September knocked out the two Nord Stream pipelines [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=630.6s)]
*  built to carry gas from Russia to Europe out of action. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=635.52s)]
*  The cause of the blast is unclear. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=639.1999999999999s)]
*  Several investigations are still taking place in countries close to the blast site. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=641.52s)]
*  So far they have said only that they believe the explosions were the result of sabotage [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=645.24s)]
*  rather than any kind of accident. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=648.6999999999999s)]
*  But one possible lead pointing toward Russian involvement and blowing up the Russian pipeline [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=651.4399999999999s)]
*  has emerged from details of suspicious Russian ship movements and the run up to the Nord [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=658.88s)]
*  Stream blasts reported by four Nordic public broadcasters and an accompanying English-language [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=664.4s)]
*  public podcast, Coldfront. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=670.4s)]
*  Very soon after the incident, the Washington Post was doing their best propagandistic act [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=674.92s)]
*  to suggest the same thing from September 27, 2022. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=680.1999999999999s)]
*  Quote, European leaders blame Russia and Russian sabotage. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=684.3199999999999s)]
*  After the Nord Stream explosions, quote, European leaders said Tuesday they believe dual explosions [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=690.74s)]
*  that damaged pipelines built to carry Russian natural gas to Europe were deliberate and [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=695.24s)]
*  some officials blamed the Kremlin, suggesting the blasts were intended as a threat to the [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=700.28s)]
*  continent. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=705.76s)]
*  Just think about that logic. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=709.04s)]
*  The Kremlin wanted to threaten Europe and say, if you continue to support Ukraine, we [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=711.88s)]
*  want to show you what we can do to you. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=717.4s)]
*  As a result, they didn't go and blow up anything that was European. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=720.6s)]
*  They didn't go and blow up something on European land. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=724.36s)]
*  They went and blew up their own pipeline to say, look, we have the capability to blow [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=726.9s)]
*  up our pipeline at any time, our own pipeline that we spent tens of billions of dollars [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=730.62s)]
*  and our best engineers and all this effort to build on, which our future economic prosperity [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=734.86s)]
*  depends, just as a threat to you to show you that we can blow up our own pipeline, think [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=739.9s)]
*  what we can do to you. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=743.5s)]
*  That was the theory the Washington Post and European countries tried to push to make it [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=744.5s)]
*  seem like it was Putin who blew up his own pipeline. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=748.1s)]
*  Quote, the damage did not have an immediate impact on Russia's energy supplies. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=750.54s)]
*  Russia cut off flows earlier this month, and European countries have scrambled to build [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=755.7s)]
*  up stockpiles and secure alternative energy sources before that. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=760.1s)]
*  Now, in case you think that the United States is too law-abiding and too benevolent to do [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=765.3000000000001s)]
*  something like blow up someone else's pipeline as an act of industrial sabotage, that would [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=773.22s)]
*  theory to suspect that the Americans would be behind such a thing. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=782.82s)]
*  I give you Victoria Nuland, who at the time was with the US State Department running Ukraine [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=787.1400000000001s)]
*  for the Biden administration, much like she did for the Obama administration, after which [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=792.38s)]
*  she had been running Iraq and NATO policy for Dick Cheney and George Bush. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=797.7800000000001s)]
*  And this was shortly before the Russians invaded Ukraine when the US government was warning [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=803.58s)]
*  that they were about to. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=807.1400000000001s)]
*  Victoria Nuland spoke at the US Department of State and tried to warn the Russians of [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=808.9s)]
*  certain things that will happen. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=812.62s)]
*  And here's one of the things she predicted. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=813.74s)]
*  With regard to Nord Stream 2, we continue to have very strong and clear conversations [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=816.98s)]
*  with our German allies. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=824.22s)]
*  And I want to be clear with you today. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=826.26s)]
*  If Russia invades Ukraine one way or another, Nord Stream 2 will not move forward. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=829.0600000000001s)]
*  Now, just to be clear, as the US media suggested, that doesn't mean she had anything to do with [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=836.14s)]
*  it. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=842.58s)]
*  What she was doing was she's like psychic. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=843.94s)]
*  And she was envisioning that if Russia invades Ukraine one way or the other, there will be [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=846.46s)]
*  no more Nord Stream 2, meaning that the Russians, she can anticipate, will probably blow up [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=852.58s)]
*  their own pipeline. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=856.7800000000001s)]
*  Paris thought that she was threatening to blow up the Nord Stream 2 pipeline if the [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=859.74s)]
*  Russians invaded. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=864.1s)]
*  Here was her boss, ostensibly. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=865.4200000000001s)]
*  Joe Biden just a couple weeks later, on February 7th, also being psychic about what would happen [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=869.1800000000001s)]
*  to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline if Russia invaded. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=876.58s)]
*  There will be no longer a Nord Stream 2. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=881.0600000000001s)]
*  We will bring an end to it. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=884.1s)]
*  How will you do that exactly, since the project and control of the project is within Germany's [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=888.3000000000001s)]
*  control? [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=896.38s)]
*  We will, I promise you, we will be able to do it. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=898.38s)]
*  Can you believe how propagandistic our media outlets are, both in the US and the West? [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=904.3s)]
*  US officials, including the President and the actual ruler of Ukraine, Victoria Nuland, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=910.54s)]
*  stood up and said, if Russia invades Ukraine, we're going to blow up the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=917.66s)]
*  we're going to destroy it, we're going to end it, where it's not going to happen anymore. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=923.14s)]
*  And then when it actually got blown up, just like they promised, the US media said, God, [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=928.7399999999999s)]
*  we cannot figure out for the life of us who might have done this. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=932.9399999999999s)]
*  And they actually tried to start suggesting that Russia blew up their own pipeline. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=938.54s)]
*  And once that didn't work, they settled on an even more preposterous story that some [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=944.3399999999999s)]
*  row group of drunken, low-level Ukrainians took a little tiny fishing boat to the Sea [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=950.94s)]
*  of Denmark and just dove while they were drunk underground without the approval of Zelensky [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=958.02s)]
*  or anyone else high up in the government. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=965.38s)]
*  It's kind of blew it up for fun, like a little boat party. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=966.86s)]
*  Took it at a boat party, had some beers, and they're like, hey, you know what, we're near [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=969.82s)]
*  the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, why don't we see if we can blow it up? [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=973.54s)]
*  And that was the version that until Seymour Hersh's article, which instantly got dismissed [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=978.1800000000001s)]
*  and mocked, and then the report this week was the one that the West more or less sold [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=981.46s)]
*  in case closed. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=985.94s)]
*  Nobody talked about who blew up the Nord Stream pipeline ever again. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=986.94s)]
*  Here was Secretary of State Antony Blinken shortly after the pipeline was actually blown [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=990.34s)]
*  up when he was asked about it at a State Department briefing. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=994.02s)]
*  Ultimately, this is also a tremendous opportunity. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=997.86s)]
*  It's a tremendous opportunity to once and for all remove the dependence on Russian energy. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1001.3000000000001s)]
*  And thus to take away from Vladimir Putin the weaponization of energy as a means of advancing [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1008.1s)]
*  his imperial designs. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1013.7s)]
*  That's very significant, and that offers tremendous strategic opportunity for the years to come. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1016.9s)]
*  But meanwhile, we're determined to do everything we possibly can to make sure that the consequences [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1024.94s)]
*  of all of this are not borne by citizens in our countries or, for that matter, around [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1030.38s)]
*  the world. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1035.5s)]
*  While the Western media was convincing people that Russia blew up its own pipeline, Antony [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1037.5s)]
*  Blinken was saying, hey, you know what? [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1044.02s)]
*  It turns out this is really good for us. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1046.4199999999998s)]
*  We've been trying to force the Europeans not to buy from Russia any longer. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1049.78s)]
*  And what do you know? [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1053.1799999999998s)]
*  Russia went and blew up its own pipeline, and all the benefits were down to us, and [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1055.3s)]
*  it only harms Russia. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1059.2199999999998s)]
*  Wow, we are so happy that Russia blew up its own pipeline and destroyed its strategic interest [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1062.46s)]
*  and benefited our own. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1067.46s)]
*  And none of this for one moment made the Western media think, are we going a little too far [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1070.18s)]
*  here in trying to convince people that Putin blew up his own pipeline? [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1074.3400000000001s)]
*  A couple of months after that, Victoria Nuland went to the Senate. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1079.66s)]
*  As you might recall, this was when she was asked by Marco Rubio in a leading way whether [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1085.8999999999999s)]
*  Ukraine had any biological labs in Ukraine that they were afraid might fall into Russian [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1093.3s)]
*  hands because there were people suggesting this, and he was hoping Victoria Nuland would [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1101.3s)]
*  say, no, of course there are no biological labs in Ukraine. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1104.66s)]
*  They don't pursue biological weapons. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1107.74s)]
*  And instead, Victoria Nuland said, yes, there are biological research facilities in Ukraine, [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1110.5400000000002s)]
*  and we're very concerned about those falling into Russian hands. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1115.66s)]
*  And then when people like myself and a few other people noticed that, we said, wait a [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1120.22s)]
*  minute, what do you mean? [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1123.5400000000002s)]
*  What does she mean by that? [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1124.5400000000002s)]
*  What biological research labs does the US and Ukraine have in their country that are [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1126.1000000000001s)]
*  so dangerous they would be afraid of having it fall into Russian hands? [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1133.8200000000002s)]
*  Every one of us who raised that question got called a Kremlin conspiracy theorist. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1139.02s)]
*  In fact, you can go to my Wikipedia page right now and there's a section called Conspiracy [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1144.1399999999999s)]
*  Theories, and the one example of my spreading conspiracy theories was when I asked what [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1148.82s)]
*  Victoria Nuland meant in this hearing when she said, something I had heard for the first [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1153.8999999999999s)]
*  time, that Ukraine has extremely dangerous bioweapon facilities, bio research facilities [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1157.86s)]
*  in Ukraine that the US was working with them to secure. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1163.54s)]
*  I wasn't the one who brought that up. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1168.54s)]
*  It was Victoria Nuland. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1169.54s)]
*  But anyway, I just remember that hearing for this, but there was another part of this hearing [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1171.66s)]
*  where she was talking to Ted Cruz, and even though it was Russia that blew up its own [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1177.6200000000001s)]
*  pipeline, both Victoria Nuland and Ted Cruz could barely contain their glee over their [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1184.1000000000001s)]
*  great luck that Vladimir Putin blew up his own industrial infrastructure. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1188.7s)]
*  I think the administration is very gratified to know that Nord Stream 2 is now, as you [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1195.38s)]
*  like to say, a hunk of metal at the bottom of the sea. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1202.8600000000001s)]
*  We talk a lot about media propaganda on this show. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1209.0600000000002s)]
*  One of the reasons for this show, and one of the reasons why I got into journalism in [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1212.46s)]
*  the first place, was because there was so much propaganda, just lies constantly circulating, [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1215.7s)]
*  false information, that my idea always was, well, I wanted to create a platform where [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1222.58s)]
*  I could push back against that, where I could show how that was false, present facts that [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1226.02s)]
*  undercut that. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1232.1799999999998s)]
*  And even though I've been doing that for 20 years now almost, sometimes it really does [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1233.1799999999998s)]
*  surprise me how far they're willing to go. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1237.6999999999998s)]
*  At the same time that they warned beforehand that they were going to blow up the Nord Stream [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1240.58s)]
*  pipeline if Russia invaded, at the same time that they had been urging since the Trump [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1245.9399999999998s)]
*  administration that the Nord Stream pipeline was terrible for U.S. interests because it [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1250.82s)]
*  allowed Western Europe to buy cheap natural gas from Russia instead of having to buy more [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1256.1s)]
*  expensive natural gas from the U.S., at the same time that they talked about all the benefits [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1259.3799999999999s)]
*  that the U.S. got from having that pipeline blown up, at the same time that Victoria Nuland [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1266.48s)]
*  giddily celebrated with Ted Cruz how lucky and happy they were that it was a, quote, [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1271.3799999999999s)]
*  hunk of metal at the bottom of the sea, the media was actually trying to claim in multiple [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1275.86s)]
*  articles that it was probably the Russians who did it. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1281.26s)]
*  And then when Seymour Hersh reported based on ample sourcing that has won multiple journalism [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1286.1399999999999s)]
*  awards for him over the decades of his career, then in fact the U.S. was involved in those [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1290.26s)]
*  operations, the entire media scoffed at it, barely paid any attention, said he was a crazy [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1294.4599999999998s)]
*  old man and decided to go instead with this theory that I guess they thought was more [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1299.78s)]
*  viable than Putin did it, which was about these rogue five Russians having a party on [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1305.58s)]
*  a little boat who on a lark decided to dive, just had a bunch of explosives with them and [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1311.54s)]
*  see if they could just do it. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1317.46s)]
*  Ukraine's not to blame because Ukraine didn't authorize it, Zelensky heard about it but [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1318.78s)]
*  he rejected it, he wasn't to blame, nobody was to blame at all except these five guys [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1321.7s)]
*  who just acted on their own. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1326.4199999999998s)]
*  And then you had that report that came out of Denmark today saying, no, actually what [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1329.74s)]
*  I saw, I wasn't allowed to talk about it until now, was these weird U.S. Navy ships right [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1333.62s)]
*  in the area who when we approached them told us to leave them alone and go back. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1338.26s)]
*  And I have to say even though U.S. propaganda, U.S. media propaganda is a major source of [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1344.3s)]
*  this show and of my work, it sometimes does surprise me when you put these things together [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1348.8999999999999s)]
*  just how far they're willing to go and in fact that has been pretty much the entire [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1354.24s)]
*  way not just that this incident, that the entire U.S. involvement in the war in Ukraine, [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1357.58s)]
*  how the war in Ukraine happened, what it's for, how it's going, all of it is characterized [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1362.88s)]
*  by the same low level of absurd propaganda that if you challenge any part of you will [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1367.16s)]
*  actually get put on an official list of being a Kremlin propaganda that has happened to [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1373.16s)]
*  not just me but to everybody who has done so and sometimes it's worth taking a step [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1377.6s)]
*  back and realizing just how extreme and far they're often willing to go because even if [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1381.7199999999998s)]
*  you're cynical and skeptical of the media, they will always go lower than you think, [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1385.56s)]
*  they will always surprise you in the way that they do that. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCPhv063WVM&t=1389.4399999999998s)]
