# "Free" U.S. Suppresses and Censors Alternative 9/11 Narratives for Decades
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [September 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U)
*  All right, I know I spent a good amount of time at the start of the show talking about [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=0.0s)]
*  the underlying causes of 9-11 and the like, and there's a few things that we have prepared [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=9.84s)]
*  that I'm going to leave out and omit, but there's a couple of things that I absolutely [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=15.08s)]
*  think are necessary to complete the conversation. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=19.96s)]
*  One of which is to point out that the idea that Al-Qaeda was motivated not by hatred [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=24.24s)]
*  of our freedoms but by our government policy in that region was not some idea relegated [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=30.599999999999998s)]
*  to the fringes of radical extremists, but was something that was openly discussed, including [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=36.26s)]
*  by the CIA, for many, many years. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=43.64s)]
*  Here from the BBC in July of 2004, Al-Qaeda's origins and the links, Al-Qaeda, meaning, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=46.599999999999994s)]
*  quote, the base, was created in 1989 as Soviet forces withdrew from Afghanistan and Osama [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=53.28s)]
*  bin Laden and his colleagues began looking for new jihadists. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=57.800000000000004s)]
*  The organization grew out of the network of Arab volunteers who had gone to Afghanistan [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=60.96s)]
*  in the 1980s to fight under the banner of Islam against Soviet communism. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=65.48s)]
*  During the anti-Soviet jihad, bin Laden and his fighters received American and Saudi funding. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=70.6s)]
*  Some analysts believe bin Laden himself had security training from the CIA. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=75.68s)]
*  The, quote, Arab Afghans, as they became known, were battle-hardened and highly motivated. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=80.2s)]
*  In fact, a lot of those fighters who were fighting to eject not American influence but [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=87.64s)]
*  Soviet influence from Afghanistan actually were called and met with to the United States [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=93.14s)]
*  and met with President Reagan in the White House where he heralded them as freedom fighters [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=97.96000000000001s)]
*  because that time they were fighting to eject Soviet occupiers from Afghanistan rather than [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  American occupiers from their lands. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=109.2s)]
*  And back then we fully understood that that was their motive, not that they hated the [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=111.96s)]
*  freedoms of the Soviet Union but that they wanted to get the Soviet Union to cease interfering [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=115.24s)]
*  in their lands and we considered them heroes for doing that. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=119.24s)]
*  Here from NBC News, December 10, 2003, bin Laden comes home to roost. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=122.64s)]
*  Michael Moran looks at US ties to Osama bin Laden, trained and funded by the CIA to wreak [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=129.6s)]
*  havoc on the Soviet Army and now turning his talents on Americans. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=133.48s)]
*  At the CIA it happens often enough to have a code name, blowback. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=138.1s)]
*  That's the CIA term, blowback. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=141.46s)]
*  Simply defined, this is the term describing an agent, an operative, or an operation that [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=145.34s)]
*  has turned on its creators. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=149.9s)]
*  Osama bin Laden, our new public enemy number one, is the personification of blowback and [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=152.1s)]
*  the fact that he is viewed as a hero by millions in the Islamic world proves again the old [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=156.01999999999998s)]
*  adage, reap what you sow. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=160.54s)]
*  Though he has come to represent all that went wrong with the CIA's reckless strategy there, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=162.85999999999999s)]
*  by the end of the Afghan war in 1989, bin Laden was still viewed by the agency, by the [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=166.22s)]
*  CIA, as something of a dilettante, a rich Saudi boy gone to war and welcomed home by [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=170.22s)]
*  Saudi monarchy he so hated as something of a hero. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=174.46s)]
*  I think one of the most important moments in our public debate when this idea finally [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=178.98s)]
*  entered the mainstream was when Ron Paul ran for president in 2008, had a much more successful [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=184.7s)]
*  outcome than anyone anticipated, especially given what he was saying. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=190.62s)]
*  He got into a very vitriolic argument with another one of the candidates seeking the [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=195.7s)]
*  Republican nomination, which was Rudy Giuliani, when Ron Paul expressed the view that the [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=201.86s)]
*  reason 9-11 happened was because of our actions there, not because they hate us for our freedom. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=208.34s)]
*  Ron Paul would have been very difficult to demonize as a traitor given his long-time [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=213.46s)]
*  service in the US military as compared to Rudy Giuliani, who never spent a day in the [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=217.14000000000001s)]
*  military, somehow avoided the war in Vietnam, like most of the people who call any dissenters [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=220.89999999999998s)]
*  traitors or whatever, kind of like the way Hillary Clinton said Tulsi Gabbard was a traitor [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=227.85999999999999s)]
*  to the United States because she was being groomed by the Russians, even though Tulsi [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=232.17999999999998s)]
*  Gabbard spent her whole adult life in the US military defending the country in combat, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=235.45999999999998s)]
*  etc., and Hillary Clinton obviously never did, nor did her husband. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=239.06s)]
*  But anyway, I think this exchange was so important because it was a Fox News debate, and you [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=242.89999999999998s)]
*  can tell the entire room, the entire stage was absolutely against Ron Paul, but I think [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=247.86s)]
*  this is one of the first times that Americans really heard this theory of causation. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=253.22000000000003s)]
*  The intervention was a major contributing factor. Have you ever read about the reasons [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=258.82s)]
*  they attacked us? They attack us because we've been over there, we've been bombing Iraq for [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=264.02000000000004s)]
*  10 years, we've been in the Middle East. I think Reagan was right. We don't understand [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=269.3s)]
*  the irrationality of Middle Eastern politics. So right now we're building an embassy in Iraq [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=275.22s)]
*  that's bigger than the Vatican. We're building 14 permanent bases. What would we say here if [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=281.54s)]
*  China was doing this in our country or in the Gulf of Mexico? We would be objecting. We need to look [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=286.5s)]
*  at what we do from the perspective of what would happen if somebody else did it to us. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=291.62s)]
*  Are you suggesting we invited the 9-11 attacks, sir? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=295.94000000000005s)]
*  I'm suggesting that we listen to the people who attacked us and the reason they did it, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=299.53999999999996s)]
*  and they are delighted that we're over there because Osama bin Laden has said, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=305.14s)]
*  I am glad you're over on our sand because we can target you so much easier. They've already now, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=309.38s)]
*  since that time, have killed 3,400 of our men, and I don't think it was necessary. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=315.06s)]
*  Let me just say that what Ron Paul was saying there, you can disagree or agree with it to [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=320.18s)]
*  whatever extent you want. I think it was a crucial moment for the truth to be heard by the American [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=324.09999999999997s)]
*  public even though they may not have been ready for it, even though they may not have been [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=329.94s)]
*  prepared to ingest it at the moment. But the only reason why he was able to make that argument was, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=333.21999999999997s)]
*  and he kept referring to it, was because he was able as a free person to read the statements of [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=338.97999999999996s)]
*  the people in that region who hate the United States. And he was saying, go read what they say. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=346.58s)]
*  And that's exactly what was censored in the United States through a collaboration, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=351.3s)]
*  an agreement between media outlets on the one hand and the government on the other, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=355.38s)]
*  an agreement not to allow Osama bin Laden or any one of his comrades or people with whom he worked [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=358.74s)]
*  to be heard in the United States by inventing this insanely insulting excuse that he might use [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=364.98s)]
*  some sort of hidden code to activate a sleeper cell, but they have been said, like, we think it's [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=370.5s)]
*  propaganda. And as our guest from the FCC, Brendan Carr, just explained, there's a constitutional [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=375.94s)]
*  right that you have to access foreign propaganda if you want. That's part of free speech is you get [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=381.06s)]
*  to access the information you want, which is why when the EU banned or made it criminal for [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=385.54s)]
*  social media platforms to platform RT, it was so offensive that you're an adult citizen of the EU, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=390.18s)]
*  even if you want to hear from the Russian government, you're now banned from doing so. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=396.74s)]
*  That was the censorship that happened in 2001, but it's also the censorship that happened just [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=400.34s)]
*  last year when the Guardian got pressured to remove a historical document of great [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=405.46s)]
*  importance, which is the bin Laden letter that Ron Paul was using to make this argument, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=411.85999999999996s)]
*  and that people on TikTok were banned from speaking about forcibly. Here's the rest of this exchange. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=415.38s)]
*  Wendell, may I make a comment on that? That's really an extraordinary statement. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=420.82s)]
*  That's an extraordinary statement as someone who lived through the attack of September 11, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=425.29999999999995s)]
*  that we invited the attack because we were attacking Iraq. I don't think I've ever heard [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=428.98s)]
*  that before, and I've heard some pretty absurd explanations for September 11. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=433.38s)]
*  Now, as we know, Rudy Giuliani was the owner of 9-11. He had full rights over how it was understood, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=442.90000000000003s)]
*  how it was talked about. I'm not really sure why. He was the mayor of New York at the time that it [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=449.06s)]
*  happened. He sort of got a reputation for doing heroic things. I'm not really sure what it was, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=453.3s)]
*  what it said he did that was so heroic, but obviously he was going to seize that moment. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=458.18s)]
*  And you heard the reaction from people, with people in the room. These are mostly Republican [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=462.42s)]
*  operatives. We've talked before. We went to the RNC debate, the first one in Milwaukee, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=467.46s)]
*  how that room is filled, where the people who get heard the loudest are all party operatives, lobbyists, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=471.78000000000003s)]
*  donors. So of course, they're going to be on Rudy Giuliani's side of that debate. But what's so notable [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=477.62s)]
*  is Rudy Giuliani said, I've never heard that before, this theory. But the reason we got attacked [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=482.98s)]
*  on 9-11 because of what we were doing in places like Iraq, where our sanctions regime killed [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=489.14000000000004s)]
*  500,000 children, which Madeleine Albright told 60 Minutes she thought was worth it, in her words, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=494.1s)]
*  or that we were overthrowing their governments and imposing, he said he never heard this before, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=500.58000000000004s)]
*  even though that was the version of events, the argument, the rationale that Al Qaeda, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=504.98s)]
*  that Osama bin Laden, that many, many people in that region had been giving for many, many years. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=511.86s)]
*  And the fact that someone like Rudy Giuliani had never heard that before, according to him, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=516.98s)]
*  until Ron Paul said it, doesn't really surprise me because it has been a great aggressive act [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=520.1800000000001s)]
*  of repression to ensure that doesn't remain in our discourse. Here was the rest of this exchange. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=525.94s)]
*  And I would ask the Congressman to withdraw that comment and tell us that he didn't really mean that. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=529.86s)]
*  Congressman? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=543.46s)]
*  I believe very sincerely that the CIA is correct when they teach and talk about blowback. When we [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=547.46s)]
*  went into Iran in 1953 and installed the Shah, yes, there was blowback. The reaction to that was [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=555.3s)]
*  the taking of our hostages. And that persists. And if we ignore that, we ignore that at our own risk, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=563.6999999999999s)]
*  if we think that we can do what we want around the world and not incite hatred, then we have a problem. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=570.18s)]
*  They don't come here to attack us because we're rich and we're free. They come and they attack [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=577.3s)]
*  us because we're over there. I mean, that has so much logic to it that it's shocking that people [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=583.14s)]
*  react to it with such venom. I think precisely because it has so much logic to it. Here, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=590.9s)]
*  just to underscore the empirical foundation of that vision, is the fact that there's a lot of [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=596.9s)]
*  research linking what was called suicide terrorism, the willingness of people to give up their own [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=602.42s)]
*  lives to kill other people from that part of the world. Obviously, their Islamic beliefs [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=608.3399999999999s)]
*  are in part what enables them to give up their own lives because of what they believe about the [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=614.3399999999999s)]
*  afterlife and the like. But Islam itself is not sufficient to do it. They need some motive to [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=618.26s)]
*  hate the people that they're attacking. And this University of Chicago political science professor, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=623.3s)]
*  Roger Pape, did a lot of research to find out what motivated that. And here you see the political [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=628.3399999999999s)]
*  headline in October of 2010. Researcher says suicide terrorism is linked to military occupation. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=634.26s)]
*  Robert Pape, a University of Chicago political science professor and former Air Force lecturer, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=641.06s)]
*  will present findings on Capitol Hill on Tuesday that argue that the majority of suicide terrorism [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=644.98s)]
*  around the world since 1980 has had a common cause, namely military occupation. Pape and his [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=649.9399999999999s)]
*  team of researchers drawn data produced by a six-year study of suicide terrorist attacks around the [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=656.26s)]
*  world that was partially funded by the Department of Defense, the threat reduction agency. They have [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=661.46s)]
*  compiled the terrorism statistics in a publicly available database comprising some 10,000 records [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=667.0600000000001s)]
*  on some 2,200 suicide terrorism attacks dating back to the first suicide terrorism attack of modern [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=672.6600000000001s)]
*  times, the 1983 truck bombing of the U.S. Marines barracks in Beirut, Lebanon, which killed 241 U.S. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=677.94s)]
*  Marines. And I should note that Ronald Reagan, despite having enormous amounts of pressure to [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=684.26s)]
*  avenge that attack, Israel was demanding that they build a massive force to attack Hezbollah and the [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=688.9s)]
*  Lebanese who were responsible for that attack on the U.S. military base, instead said, what are we [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=693.86s)]
*  doing? Why do we have a huge military base in Lebanon where they were not wanted? And he pulled [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=698.18s)]
*  out that military base, understanding that it was highly provocative and was not in the American [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=702.02s)]
*  interest. The article goes on, quote, we have lots of evidence now that when you put the foreign [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=707.86s)]
*  military presence in, it triggers suicide terrorism campaigns and that when the foreign forces leave, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=713.46s)]
*  it takes away almost 100 percent of the terrorist campaign, Pape said in an interview last week on [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=720.18s)]
*  his findings. Pape said there had been a dramatic spike in suicide bombings in Afghanistan since U.S. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=724.34s)]
*  forces began to expand their presence to the south and east of the country in 2006. While there was a [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=729.46s)]
*  total of 12 suicide attacks from 2001 to 2005 in Afghanistan, when the U.S. had a relatively limited [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=734.82s)]
*  true presence, since 2006 there have been more than 450 suicide attacks in Afghanistan and they [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=741.3s)]
*  are growing more lethal, Pape said. Deaths due to suicide attacks in Afghanistan have gone up by a [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=747.14s)]
*  third in the year since President Barack Obama added 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan. Quote, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=752.02s)]
*  it's not making it any better, Pape said. Honestly, it's stunning that we even need [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=757.2199999999999s)]
*  empirical evidence on this. It just takes a little bit of empathy. As Ron Paul said, think about it, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=764.9s)]
*  if that were being done to our country, if there were some foreign power arming Mexico and Canada, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=771.06s)]
*  say China, to intervene in our country, to blow things up, to undermine our government, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=775.9399999999999s)]
*  and then China itself started occupying our government or Russia or whomever you want to [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=784.18s)]
*  fantasize about. There's actually a 1984 film, very popular film, where the Russians occupied, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=788.42s)]
*  invaded and occupied the United States and it glorified the people who were using what would [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=794.8199999999999s)]
*  be called terrorism, resistance, violent resistance against them, which is of course what you would do [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=799.14s)]
*  if people are interfering in your country. You'd be very angry at the outside forces responsible [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=803.14s)]
*  for that. I mean, it's just so blatantly obvious. Now, I just want to show you this one clip [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=807.9399999999999s)]
*  where I, I guess, debated this issue with my friend Megyn Kelly on her program. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=815.38s)]
*  And I consider Megyn Kelly very smart, very sophisticated, very insightful analyst. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=822.18s)]
*  But she came out of Fox News and that's where a lot of this mythology about 9-11 originated, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=829.14s)]
*  the idea that anything, if you say anything like what Ron Paul said, you're sort of a [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=835.78s)]
*  traitor, that it's of course all about Islam, has nothing to do with us. And I guess I was kind of [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=840.34s)]
*  surprised that even 22 years later she still believes that and so we were able to explore in [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=845.06s)]
*  a very civil way, but I think also spirited way and therefore revealing what the foundations of [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=850.34s)]
*  these views are in and how valid they are. I just want to show you a little bit of this exchange. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=857.94s)]
*  I get that. I see that point, but I also feel like, one, they hate us. They hate, like the Iranian, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=864.6600000000001s)]
*  not the Iranian people, but like the leaders over in Iran, they're going to hate us less if we don't [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=871.62s)]
*  back Israel. I don't buy it. Hell no. They hate us because of our principles, because of our [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=876.5s)]
*  constitution, because of the way we live, because women walk around in tank tops. We could go down [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=881.3800000000001s)]
*  the list, but it's not going to go away if we stop supporting Israel. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=885.62s)]
*  Megan, this was the debate about 9-11. Like, why did they hate us? Why did they attack us? And [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=890.98s)]
*  the neocon narrative was, oh, they hate us for our freedoms. And Bin Laden repeatedly said there was [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=896.58s)]
*  that letter that recirculated that was banned from TikTok. We are angry at America because they are [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=901.86s)]
*  constantly insinuating themselves into our region. They imposed a sanctions regime on Iraq that killed [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=908.1s)]
*  hundreds of thousands of Iraqi children. They put troops on Saudi soil. The reason Iran hates us, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=913.06s)]
*  and I'm not justifying it at all, but I think it's very important to have an open, [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=918.9799999999999s)]
*  open eyes about your own country, is that in 1954, we overthrew their democratically elected [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=924.02s)]
*  government. The CIA did, and we imposed on them for the next 25 years, one of the most savage and [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=929.78s)]
*  brutal dictatorships in the world, the Shah of Iran. And so when Iran had its revolution and [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=935.6999999999999s)]
*  finally deposed their dictator, the Shah of Iran, of course they knew the United States was [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=941.7s)]
*  responsible for his imposition on them for all those decades. And so they had a lot of animosity [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=946.1s)]
*  toward the United States. There are all kinds of countries in the world, Korea and Japan and Brazil. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=952.82s)]
*  Yeah, but Glenn, I mean, you're looking at a country, Israel. Israel has a sense of due [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=961.1400000000001s)]
*  process and fairness. And Iran is hanging people from cranes. Iran is stoning women to death for [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=965.06s)]
*  not wearing the damn hijab. How the hell are we going to have a relationship with them? It's a no. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=972.42s)]
*  Megan, we have relationships with the most savage dictators on the planet, our close allies. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=979.06s)]
*  But in this instance, we do need to choose. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=984.3399999999999s)]
*  And our close allies in Egypt. Okay, but you have Saudi Arabia, Egypt, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=985.9399999999999s)]
*  all of which are American allies that are among the most brutal and savage dictatorships in the [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=992.82s)]
*  world. We're fine with having relationships, good relationships and alliances with countries [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=997.0600000000001s)]
*  that are extremely repressive as long as they do the bidding in the United States. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=1002.82s)]
*  One of the reasons is their hatred of Iran and vice versa. I mean, those two groups are [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=1008.1800000000001s)]
*  Shiite versus Sunni and there's a long-standing hatred between them. One of them wants to [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=1013.86s)]
*  completely annihilate Israel and one of them was actually open-minded to doing a deal with Israel [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=1018.18s)]
*  and getting to a better place when we were backing Israel under Trump, when we were helping making it [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=1023.14s)]
*  stronger. And these other allies, Saudi Arabia and the others, were starting to look at it like, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=1027.86s)]
*  you know what, maybe we are going to have to deal with this country. We were moving toward peace. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=1031.86s)]
*  It's true. The dictators of Egypt and Saudi Arabia and the Gulf state regions understand [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=1037.3s)]
*  that there can be economic benefits from relationship with Israel. They don't represent [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=1042.34s)]
*  the people of those countries. These are dictators imposed by military coups that the United States [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=1045.46s)]
*  propped up. And all I'm saying is we're very tribal as human beings. We always like to see [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=1050.02s)]
*  things through the perspective of our side to believe that we're the morally superior ones, [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=1055.46s)]
*  we're the victims, they're the aggressors, they're evil. I understand the appeal of that narrative, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=1059.38s)]
*  but you were just talking about the multiple wars that we fought in the Middle East. We invaded Iraq [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=1063.78s)]
*  and destroyed it. That strengthened Iran by strengthening the Shiite militia. Saddam Hussein [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=1069.38s)]
*  was a vehement opponent of Iran. We created the vacuum out of which ISIS emerged. Even Tony Blair [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=1074.74s)]
*  says that. We were in Afghanistan for 20 years. We've been bombing that region for a long time. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=1080.98s)]
*  I think on some level we have to take some responsibility for why there's anti-American [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=1085.78s)]
*  resentment in that region and ask whether that's worth it. I agree with that. I don't disagree with [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=1090.82s)]
*  you at all on that. And I'm very- So you can watch the whole debate if you want. I didn't mean to [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=1097.3s)]
*  select a certain part, but I felt like it was a pretty good representative sampling. And [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=1102.9s)]
*  as I was listening to this, I'm honestly amazed of the need to point these things out [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=1106.9s)]
*  that I think should be so self-evident. But I also understand that even the smartest people [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=1114.5s)]
*  are vulnerable to propaganda. We all are, every single one of us. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=1121.5400000000002s)]
*  When I started writing about politics full-time, one of the things that started to shock me [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=1126.9s)]
*  was how many beliefs I had ingested that were just false, that just kind of I absorbed from [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=1130.74s)]
*  the ether because I wasn't focused on politics. I wasn't deconstructing the premises of it. I [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=1136.58s)]
*  didn't have time to investigate it, go to original sources. And only once I started to do that, [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=1141.86s)]
*  and I wasn't 20 years old, I was in my late 30s, I saw how many things I had ingested that were [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=1146.42s)]
*  absolutely false, including some of that mythology about 9-11. But I do think that's amazing, but I [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=1153.38s)]
*  think the most amazing thing, and honestly that's why I wanted to use the opportunity one more time [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=1160.5s)]
*  to stress this, because I haven't thought about this incident for quite some time, but having [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=1163.86s)]
*  revisited it today when planning the show and talking about it, I just want you to focus and [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=1168.5s)]
*  remember how unbelievable it is that soon as young Americans started to discover the Bin Laden letter [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=1173.7s)]
*  and question the narrative that they've been fed for 20 years about why the 9-11 attack happened [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=1181.46s)]
*  and started to make links between our involvement in the region, our support for Israel, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=1186.34s)]
*  bombing of those countries, our overthrowing of their governments, our imposition of the dictators. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=1190.9s)]
*  When they started to make that link, oh wow, this has been going on for a long time and it's actually [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=1195.7s)]
*  part of why 9-11 happened. It's not because they hated us for our freedoms. There was an immediate, [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=1200.9s)]
*  systemic, successful attempt to wipe that letter from the internet so that no one could read it [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=1205.14s)]
*  anymore. I cannot believe that the Guardian removed that document from its website. What kind of media [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=1210.18s)]
*  would do that? Oh my god, these people are reading this document. We better take it down. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=1217.0600000000002s)]
*  We can't have them reading this and consuming it and debating it. And then TikTok, desperate to stay [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=1221.38s)]
*  in the country, was easily pressured within 24 hours to just ban any discussion. They took down [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=1226.98s)]
*  every video talking about that Bin Laden letter. They banned the hashtags that people were using [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=1233.7s)]
*  to find it. The link to the document no longer worked. That is real censorship. It's been going [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=1237.8600000000001s)]
*  on for 23 years in this country, starting from that time when the government and the media [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNJtigWuJ8U&t=1243.14s)]
