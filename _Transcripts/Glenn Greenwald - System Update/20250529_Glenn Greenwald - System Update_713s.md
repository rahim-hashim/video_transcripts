# Dems' Pathetic Search For Their Own Joe Rogan
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [May 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8)
*  Bernie's recent appearance on the flagrant podcast with Andrew Schultz had a whole room [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=0.0s)]
*  of popular podcast bros clamoring for the exact democratic socialism establishment [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=11.52s)]
*  Dems insisted would turn off the public. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=18.32s)]
*  You know what your reflection is and Bernie said it on flagrant. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=21.32s)]
*  Everybody's the fucking blame. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=26.240000000000002s)]
*  You're saying the Democrat thing is not a Republican thing. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=27.799999999999997s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=30.119999999999997s)]
*  This is government has failed the people. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=31.119999999999997s)]
*  We live in a capitalist society where you got all of these motherfuckers with all the [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=33.56s)]
*  wealth. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=37.32s)]
*  Elon Musk has more wealth than 50, more than half of the bottom of America. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=38.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=42.239999999999995s)]
*  Come on. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=43.239999999999995s)]
*  There's no way we live in a society that's claimed to be the most wealthiest society [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=44.239999999999995s)]
*  on the planet and we can't fix homelessness. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=46.84s)]
*  Well, in that case, the Democrats' pivot should be to go more socialist. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=48.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=52.959999999999994s)]
*  Which I'm fine with. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=53.959999999999994s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=54.959999999999994s)]
*  That's what everybody's saying. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=55.959999999999994s)]
*  Because the Republican solution to what you just described is going to be more capitalism. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=57.68s)]
*  Deregulation. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=64.68s)]
*  Everybody's saying it. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=65.68s)]
*  Look, it seems obvious that left populism is the way for Democrats to push back against [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=68.68s)]
*  Trump's right populism, which unfortunately is increasingly informed by the tech billionaires [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=73.52s)]
*  that fund his campaign rather than the working class real populist who voted him into office. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=79.36s)]
*  You got to ask yourself, is pardoning reality TV stars convicted of tax fraud really improving [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=85.48s)]
*  your ability to support your family? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=91.72s)]
*  What about growing the military budget and the deficit at the same time while cutting [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=93.96000000000001s)]
*  special education funding? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=98.78s)]
*  What about shifting wealth from the bottom 60% of working age households to the top income [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=100.88000000000001s)]
*  brackets? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=106.36s)]
*  Look, no matter what your politics are, two parties that are competing for support of [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=107.36s)]
*  working class Americans instead of aligning with corrupt billionaires would be a good [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=112.98s)]
*  thing. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=117.42s)]
*  But you can't convince someone of something they're paid not to understand, which is why [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=118.42s)]
*  Democrats are instead of embracing popular policies like Medicare for all or a tax on [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=123.74000000000001s)]
*  billionaires are choosing to spend millions of dollars to figure out how to get this speak [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=129.02s)]
*  to American men. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=136.7s)]
*  I really wish I were kidding here. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=138.3s)]
*  According to the New York Times, Democrats have spent $20 million with donors and strategists [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=141.86s)]
*  holing up in luxury hotel rooms brainstorming how to convince working class men to return [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=147.18s)]
*  to the party. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=153.42000000000002s)]
*  You really can't make this stuff up. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=154.42000000000002s)]
*  Dems are obsessed with finding the Joe Rogan of the left, but they could not be barking [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=157.54000000000002s)]
*  up a wronger tree. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=163.22000000000003s)]
*  Hilariously, they seem to be tapping one of their most insidious surrogates, Olivia Juliana, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=165.46s)]
*  to message better on men while continuing to treat Sanders, the man who was literally [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=171.84s)]
*  endorsed by the actual Joe Rogan back in 2020 as a pariah. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=176.76s)]
*  What about AOC and Bernie? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=182.16s)]
*  You make the point- [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=188.04s)]
*  That's all we talk about is AOC and Bernie, but go ahead, let's continue to talk about [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=189.04s)]
*  AOC and Bernie. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=191.4s)]
*  I'm only asking about it because- [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=192.4s)]
*  Okay, right. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=193.4s)]
*  I understand. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=194.4s)]
*  Because they are doing something, they're clearly putting themselves out there. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=195.4s)]
*  You know what they don't do? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=197.8s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=198.8s)]
*  Win elections. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=199.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=200.8s)]
*  To be clear, Carville hasn't won an election since Bill Clinton in the 90s, but I digress. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=202.76000000000002s)]
*  The reason why Democrats' mission to find their own Joe Rogan will fail is obvious. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=210.68s)]
*  To be a credible interlocutor in the political space, you have to be willing to say the true [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=216.4s)]
*  thing when it's hard, even when it's critical of your party, especially when it's critical [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=221.20000000000002s)]
*  of your party. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=227.8s)]
*  Remember Manosphere podcaster Andrew Schultz? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=230.04s)]
*  He gets it. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=232.35999999999999s)]
*  Do you need a liberal Joe Rogan, or do you just need to come on podcasts that you avoided? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=235.64s)]
*  That's a great fucking point. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=240.92s)]
*  That you were asked to come on? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=241.92s)]
*  Great fucking point. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=242.92s)]
*  It's not about having a liberal conservative. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=243.92s)]
*  It's about coming on places that are curious, that are not trying to pit you as a specific [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=244.92s)]
*  thing or get you or edit an interview to make you look bad so that the people that are consuming [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=249.84s)]
*  bad network's content feel good about their political opinions. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=255.64s)]
*  An honest conversation is what people, or a good faith conversation is what people are [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=258.88s)]
*  going to enjoy, and that happens. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=261.6s)]
*  I literally saw the media from the Pete interview. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=263.8s)]
*  It was like, Pete goes on Right Wing Pod and has great conversation and totally convinces [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=266.36s)]
*  them of stuff. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=270.6s)]
*  Then after the Bernie one happened, you start to see the conversation go from extreme right [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=271.6s)]
*  to just like, Bernie has fantastic conversation on filigree podcast, even the way we're seen. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=276.52s)]
*  It's like, maybe if you continue to do that. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=281.52s)]
*  Now, if Kamala came on, people would know she sucks because she sucks, but that's on [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=283.8s)]
*  her. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=287.6s)]
*  She's just a very unpopular candidate. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=289.32000000000005s)]
*  I just wish they didn't lie. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=290.32000000000005s)]
*  We asked so many times to let her expose that she sucks. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=291.32000000000005s)]
*  Even on MSNBC, I guess, if Aiman's show was also able to identify the core issue here. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=297.16s)]
*  Do you think they even have the stomach for it though? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=304.04s)]
*  I mean, what it actually requires to allow someone to be successful in that platform? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=307.84000000000003s)]
*  Because while Joe Rogan may now be aligned with much of the right, he actually disagrees [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=313.04s)]
*  with them on plenty of issues still. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=317.44s)]
*  And he's not controlled by like the RNC is not like giving him talking points for all [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=320.0s)]
*  his guests. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=325.36s)]
*  Come on. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=326.36s)]
*  And same with others like Theo Vonn as well. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=327.36s)]
*  You know, the DNC does not have the best history of letting, you know, parts of their their [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=328.88s)]
*  faction like come forward and speak very freely. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=335.76s)]
*  I just don't see them being comfortable having someone who's going to take risks in that [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=338.48s)]
*  platform that very much requires you to be authentic and willing to take. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=342.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=346.59999999999997s)]
*  We like we need an authentic voice that's going to become popular organically and we [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=347.59999999999997s)]
*  need to control them. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=351.47999999999996s)]
*  That's like that's not like Bill Maher exists. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=352.91999999999996s)]
*  He was associated with Democrats. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=356.84s)]
*  See right there at the end is a great summary of the impossibility of what Democrats think [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=362.0s)]
*  they're going to achieve. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=366.96s)]
*  We need an authentic voice that's going to become popular organically and we need to [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=368.32s)]
*  control them. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=374.12s)]
*  Good luck with that, Democrats. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=375.94s)]
*  Good luck with that. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=378.06s)]
*  We're going to be back after a brief break to talk to Katie Halper. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=380.64s)]
*  Stick around. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=385.02s)]
*  Here's a news story. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=392.58s)]
*  Treasury Secretary Scott Bensit says the growing recession fears are, quote, media-driven. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=393.9s)]
*  We've all seen on mainstream media often manipulates public opinion. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=400.17999999999995s)]
*  We just spent an hour showing you on that. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=402.73999999999995s)]
*  They push their narratives that serve their interests. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=404.22s)]
*  They tell one side or one part of a story. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=406.22s)]
*  That's why I started the show and then partnered with Ground News. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=409.3s)]
*  They're a platform built on the belief that you deserve to see the whole truth without [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=412.86s)]
*  corporate filters or political censorship. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=417.06s)]
*  For every story, their app and website pulls in every single report from across the political [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=419.42s)]
*  spectrum. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=423.82000000000005s)]
*  So all I have to do is swipe through coverage with tags exposing each outlet's bias, credibility [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=424.82000000000005s)]
*  and corporate influence to find out the facts they're ignoring and why. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=429.3s)]
*  So take that story I mentioned about Scott Bensit and Trump's tariffs. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=433.18s)]
*  Treasury Secretary Scott Bensit called out the media for fueling unnecessary recession [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=437.1s)]
*  fears because the fundamentals of our economy are strong. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=441.86s)]
*  But when you look at who's actually reporting on it, every single outlet is coming from [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=444.86s)]
*  the right that's promoting that narrative. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=449.86s)]
*  There's almost no coverage from mainstream and liberal media on that. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=451.34000000000003s)]
*  And you know there's something strange going on when a story is being actively ignored [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=454.86s)]
*  by half the media. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=457.68s)]
*  That's why Ground News built one of their most important tools, the blind spot feed. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=458.68s)]
*  It exposes stories that either side of the political spectrum isn't reporting on so you [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=463.28000000000003s)]
*  can actually see the world as it is, not just the version they want you to see. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=467.44s)]
*  Ground News is rebuilding trust in news by giving power back to the public rather than [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=471.56s)]
*  all concentrating them in the hands of media elites. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=475.76s)]
*  That's why they're completely independent and funded by readers like us. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=478.68s)]
*  But I got 40 percent, my viewers, 40 percent off the same Vance's plan I've been using [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=482.36s)]
*  to get unlimited access to all of their features. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=486.84000000000003s)]

*  Back with Katie Halper, you know her from the Katie Halper podcast and also co-host of useful [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=510.92s)]
*  idiots with Aaron MatÃ©. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=515.8s)]
*  Welcome to System Update. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=517.24s)]
*  Thanks, really. Thanks for having me. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=519.7199999999999s)]
*  Excited to be here. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=521.3599999999999s)]
*  Katie, it's a pleasure. I can't wait to pick your brain about some of the viral clips, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=523.04s)]
*  especially from the sort of Manosphere podcast arena that have gone viral precisely because [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=528.16s)]
*  of how well Bernie Sanders himself and his ideas have translated into a sphere that [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=535.0799999999999s)]
*  Democrats have insisted were so right wing and so far gone. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=540.8s)]
*  They spent so many years vilifying, but now seem to be trying to enter into those [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=544.4s)]
*  kinds of spaces. What do you make of it? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=550.8s)]
*  I mean, I think it's funny because of course, not to be self-promoting, but they're [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=553.64s)]
*  searching for the what is it left wing Joe Rogan. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=557.4s)]
*  What about a Brianna Joy Gray and Katie Halper to take the mantle? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=561.52s)]
*  But no, it is ironic that, you know, the same people who were throwing Bernie under the [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=567.0s)]
*  bus, smearing him, attacking him, are now saying that he has some kind of messaging [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=573.96s)]
*  that's good for the Democrats. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=580.32s)]
*  There's always this obsession with messaging over content and program, but that's kind [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=582.08s)]
*  of another issue. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=585.88s)]
*  But, you know, I think people continue to smear Bernie Sanders, but to the extent that [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=587.0400000000001s)]
*  they are praising him, they're praising him now because they know he's not going to run. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=592.0400000000001s)]
*  So I think they think it's safe for them to praise his ideas because they actually are [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=596.4000000000001s)]
*  either just paying lip service to it or they are afraid of Bernie's more progressive [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=601.8000000000001s)]
*  stances that actually challenge the status quo. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=609.12s)]
*  Yeah, I think that really gets to the core of the issue that the Democratic Party for [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=612.72s)]
*  years has managed to try to frame themselves as some way different than the establishment [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=617.32s)]
*  wing of the Republican Party, despite having the same substantive, the same corporate [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=622.2s)]
*  donors by leaning and going all to identity politics. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=625.9200000000001s)]
*  Now there's been a backlash against that. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=629.4s)]
*  They're saying, OK, well, now we've got to find some other messaging problem. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=632.24s)]
*  When the whole reason why they went all in on identity politics and now are going all [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=635.4399999999999s)]
*  in on this idea that if they just get the right man who's lift enough weights to say [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=639.48s)]
*  the right thing, that they will also be able to compete is because they're allergic. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=643.76s)]
*  Their corporate base makes them allergic to actually advancing the kind of ideas that [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=647.56s)]
*  made Bernie popular in the first place. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=651.84s)]
*  Acting like this guy was somehow a ball of charisma as much as, you know, I liked his [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=653.76s)]
*  sort of like grumpy, straightforward persona. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=658.9200000000001s)]
*  He wasn't winning hearts and minds because he was a charm generator. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=661.4s)]
*  It was because as Joe Rogan himself said when he was endorsing Bernie Sanders back [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=667.6s)]
*  in 2020, he's a man that's been saying the same thing for the last 40 years and he has [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=672.52s)]
*  credibility. He's trustworthy. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=677.52s)]
*  And it's amazing to see to rewatch that endorsement now that the Democrats are in the [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=679.28s)]
*  middle of this incredible credibility crisis. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew168rAVG8&t=684.2s)]
