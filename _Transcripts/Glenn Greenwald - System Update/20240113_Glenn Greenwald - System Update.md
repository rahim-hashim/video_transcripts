# Ben Shapiro’s Garbage Defense of Biden’s Yemen Bombing
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [January 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY)
*  If you look at those, let's say four key prongs of Biden's foreign policy, Ukraine, Israel, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=0.0s)]
*  Yemen and China, the establishment wing of the Republican Party, the dominant wing of [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=12.88s)]
*  the Republican Party represented in the presidential race by Nikki Haley and in the Congress and [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=18.88s)]
*  the Senate by people like Lindsey Graham and Marco Rubio and Tom Cotton are fully on board with all [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=24.16s)]
*  of those policies. The policy toward China has been to militarily encircle it, to put bases in [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=30.64s)]
*  places like South Korea and Japan and the Philippines and off various islands to essentially militarily [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=37.36s)]
*  encircle. The Chinese, Biden was the first president in decades to explicitly state the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=44.08s)]
*  U.S. would go to war with China in order to defend Taiwan and almost all of these foreign policy [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=49.44s)]
*  prongs, the core ones that define the Biden approach to the world have received applause from [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=57.92s)]
*  the vast majority of the Republican Party which supported the war in Ukraine, which obviously [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=64.4s)]
*  supports the U.S. paying for and arming of Israel, which supports the bombing of Yemen and which [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=70.08s)]
*  supports an antagonistic and aggressive posture toward China. Here is Ben Shapiro, yesterday just [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=78.48s)]
*  as one example, who spent 15 minutes or so on his program justifying and cheerleading the decision [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=85.44s)]
*  of the Biden administration to bomb Yemen, not just the act of bombing Yemen but the rationale for it. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=92.56s)]
*  Now obviously Ben Shapiro is somewhat of a special case because he is somebody who has long wanted [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=98.08000000000001s)]
*  the American armed forces to be used to fight against Israel's enemies. It's something that [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=104.88s)]
*  is a very consistent part of his worldview but it's not like he's aberrational in that regard. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=110.8s)]
*  There are a lot of people who believe that the United States should devote everything it can, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=115.44s)]
*  its resources, its bombs, its military, to seeing the world through the eyes of Israel, to see [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=120.08s)]
*  Israel's enemies as the United States' enemies and so obviously with the Houthi saying we're against [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=126.16s)]
*  the destruction of Gaza, we're taking retaliation against Israeli ships and American ships, Ben [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=132.56s)]
*  Shapiro is thrilled that there are now combat troops of the United States armed forces now [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=138.32s)]
*  actively fighting in the Middle East against one of Israel's enemies. Not just the Houthis but in [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=144.72s)]
*  Ben Shapiro's eyes an arm of Iran, the ultimate enemy of Israel that neocons and warmongers have [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=149.92000000000002s)]
*  long wanted the United States to fight. Remember at the start of the war in Israel people like [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=155.84s)]
*  Lindsey Graham and Nikki Haley were saying let's bomb Iran. Lindsey Graham recently said let's bomb [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=160.96s)]
*  Iran off the map and so this obsession with going to war with Iran has long been a centerpiece of [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=167.20000000000002s)]
*  traditional Republican, Bush-Cheney, kind of Mitt Romney foreign policy that would fit perfectly [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=174.16s)]
*  comfortably into the GOP establishment prior to Trump which they're eager to bring back. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=181.28s)]
*  So here's Ben Shapiro, I think it's worth going through a few excerpts of what he said. Again, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=186.8s)]
*  in defense of the Biden administration's decision to launch a new war against one of Israel's enemies. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=192.16s)]
*  So last night CENTCOM as well as a bunch of other foreign countries part of an American alliance [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=197.84s)]
*  struck at targets in Yemen. They struck the Houthis. The Houthis are a ragtag group of terrorists [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=203.28s)]
*  who have taken over a large swath of Yemen after a massive civil war between the Houthis and the [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=209.12s)]
*  Saudis over control of the country. The Iranians have been funding the Houthis for years and years [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=214.8s)]
*  and years and we'll get into the history of what exactly happened with the Houthis. Suffice it to [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=219.60000000000002s)]
*  say the reason that all of this is happening right now is because the Houthis decided that they were [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=223.12s)]
*  going to try to act as an Iranian proxy arm and generate support for Iran by attacking Israel and [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=228.48000000000002s)]
*  then by more largely attacking shipping in the Red Sea. Now shooting off a few rockets or missiles [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=234.4s)]
*  at Israel to get down by American ships or by the Saudis that really didn't have much of an impact [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=239.76000000000002s)]
*  on world opinion or on the world at large but attacking ships in the Red Sea absolutely does. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=244.16s)]
*  Okay he's exactly right. He's seeing the world through the Israeli perspective. He's saying the [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=249.92s)]
*  motive of the Yemenis is to strike back at Israel as punishment for what they're doing in Gaza. So [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=255.51999999999998s)]
*  the question yet again becomes how is that an American war? The Yemenis haven't killed anybody. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=261.44s)]
*  They haven't sunk any American ships. They have been trying to impede the flow of commercial [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=267.36s)]
*  travel through the Red Sea by some countries that they perceive as being responsible for the [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=275.12s)]
*  Israeli war in Gaza. But why does this mean that the United States now has to go to war [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=281.12s)]
*  because the Houthis are angry about what the Israelis are doing? This is something we talked [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=286.72s)]
*  about from the start that the cost that the United States was incurring in order to defend this foreign [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=290.88s)]
*  country yet again is not just measured in the billions of dollars that we're going to spend [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=296.48s)]
*  to transfer to the Israelis nor in the already depleted stockpiles we're going to use to transfer [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=301.76s)]
*  the weapons to them that they're using as everyone knows to destroy Yemen. Whenever there's a video [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=306.56s)]
*  of babies that are killed or children being operated on without anesthesia broadcast to the [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=312.48s)]
*  entire world everybody knows that it was American weapons that that did that and that bears a real [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=317.84000000000003s)]
*  cost. But the biggest cost is the danger that we're going to now have the bench viewers of the [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=322.32s)]
*  world demanding and now getting and now celebrating the deployment of American troops in an actual [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=327.52s)]
*  fighting war and a shooting war against other Israeli enemies in the Middle East. That's what [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=333.44s)]
*  we have and that explanation of his makes clear that that is actually the dynamic that [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=338.0s)]
*  he is happy about. Let's watch a couple other excerpts. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=344.32s)]
*  The prior year well all of this drove last night an allied attack on certain resources in Yemen [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=347.76s)]
*  controlled by the Houthis. It was a telegraphed punch meaning this entire exercise was designed [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=354.23999999999995s)]
*  to deter the who these not designed to actually kill or destabilize the Houthis who in fact as we [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=358.71999999999997s)]
*  say are a terrorist group that governs a large swath part of Yemen. The reason to telegraph the [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=363.91999999999996s)]
*  attack is to allow Iranians to get their military forces out of the way so as not to provoke and [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=369.28s)]
*  escalation with Iran more directly because of course Iran has lots of forces on the ground [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=374.72s)]
*  helping out the who these in Yemen. Now obviously needless to say anybody who dislikes Israel or who [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=378.96000000000004s)]
*  fights against Israel is a terrorist. That's pretty much the definition at this point. Any group that [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=385.04s)]
*  defies the orders of the United States or Israel is a terrorist organization and even though the [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=394.0s)]
*  is a terrorist organization and even though the who these are now running and governing [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=399.36s)]
*  Yemen, Ben Shapiro wants to call them a terrorist organization but as he just said it was a [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=405.68s)]
*  campaign that we had telegraphed for many weeks. It was something that was very well planned. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=412.88s)]
*  Everybody knew it was coming and that begs the question that we raised in the first segment of [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=418.48s)]
*  why the Biden administration could not simply have gone to Congress to debate whether or not [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=422.96000000000004s)]
*  it was time to go start a new war, a risk a new war in order to fight against one of Israel's [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=427.76s)]
*  enemies in the Middle East. It should have been openly debated and then voted on in Congress for [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=434.32s)]
*  exactly the reason Ben Shapiro just said there was no emergency there. It didn't pop out out of [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=438.64s)]
*  nowhere. The opposite was true. It was very deliberate and we had weeks to plan it and [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=443.2s)]
*  threaten it which means we had ample time to have gone to Congress to debate it and to seek its [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=448.96000000000004s)]
*  authorization. A blow. The who these of course say they're not going to be deterred because the [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=454.32s)]
*  way this works in the Middle East is that you have basically terrorist groups that provoke a [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=460.32s)]
*  response from an overwhelming power. They get their asses absolutely kicked and then they claim [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=464.15999999999997s)]
*  that just because they survived they won. That's what's currently going on in the Gaza Strip. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=468.4s)]
*  Hamas provokes a gigantic Israeli military response, the largest Israeli military response [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=471.68s)]
*  to any attack since 1973 and they get their asses absolutely handed to them and most of their [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=476.71999999999997s)]
*  fighters killed and most of their leadership killed and then if they are breathing at the end [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=481.68s)]
*  of it they claim victory. The who these are playing the same game. It's really honestly [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=485.04s)]
*  cowardly sort of stuff. Nasr al-Din Amir. It's cowardly stuff. He's sitting in the studio [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=490.88s)]
*  making millions of dollars a year, maybe millions of dollars a month to cheer the deployment [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=496.88s)]
*  of American troops in that region to defend this foreign country that he acknowledges he has a [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=505.2s)]
*  great deal of loyalty to and love for. The who these are confronting the most powerful military [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=511.12s)]
*  in the world and are saying they're going to continue to do it because of the cause that [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=518.72s)]
*  they believe in which is trying to get and impose some cost on Israel and the United States for [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=524.24s)]
*  killing an enormous number of civilians in Gaza and destroying civilian Palestinian life. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=533.28s)]
*  Now whatever else you want to say about the who these what they are doing is not cowardly. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=540.48s)]
*  Cowardly is sitting in a studio sending other people to war for your pleasure or for your [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=546.16s)]
*  agenda. That's cowardly. Spending your whole life demanding more and more wars that you and your [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=551.2s)]
*  family never go fight. That's cowardly. Cowardly is not what the who these are doing. Whatever [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=557.12s)]
*  else you might want to think about them. The official told the Wall Street Journal this is a [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=561.2s)]
*  brutal aggression. I love this. It's a brutal, Amir. A who the official told the Wall Street [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=564.4s)]
*  Journal this is a brutal aggression. I love this. It's a brutal aggression. Honest to God, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=568.64s)]
*  if America and its allies wanted to commit quote-unquote brutal aggression against the [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=573.6s)]
*  who these this guy would not be alive to talk about it. Say they will undoubtedly pay its price. We'll [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=576.96s)]
*  not waver in our stance to support the Palestinian people regardless of the cost. After the coalition [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=580.96s)]
*  strikes the U.S. had not seen any direct retaliatory action directed toward U.S. or other coalition [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=586.48s)]
*  members in the Red Sea and again the strikes came with a lot of warning. One week ago the U.S. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=590.4s)]
*  Britain key allies issued an ultimatum saying stop it and then they didn't stop it and then on [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=595.36s)]
*  New Year's Day Biden convened his national security team to discuss the options and then despite the [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=600.24s)]
*  coalition warning the who these fired an anti-ship ballistic missile that fell into the water within [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=604.64s)]
*  sight of a commercial vessel. Now the who these knew that the United States and its allies were [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=608.4s)]
*  going to strike all these targets and so they had relocated some of their weapons and equipment and [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=613.2s)]
*  fortified others. The question is whether this is going to deter further action from the who these. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=616.72s)]
*  The answer is probably not when you telegraph punches like this it is very unlikely that is [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=621.12s)]
*  going to convince the who these to stop what they are doing. No I agree with him there too. This is [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=625.68s)]
*  very unlikely to be the end of this escalation. This war is likely to go on which means we have [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=630.64s)]
*  a new Middle East war. The question is for how long it will go on for how many more exchanges of [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=635.28s)]
*  violence will it entail how many people will be killed how much retaliation will there be. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=641.76s)]
*  Ben Shapiro seems extremely unbothered by those questions. Ones that should have been [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=646.96s)]

*  in legitimately evil awful group. So the who these are an Iranian proxy group Iran as we've [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=706.48s)]
*  explained is a terror sponsor it has its tentacles all over the Middle East it has its tentacles in [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=712.16s)]
*  Iraq obviously where they've had significant. I have to laugh so much I mean I really laugh like I [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=717.4399999999999s)]
*  find it darkly funny when people like Ben Shapiro complain in general that Iran has all of its [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=722.72s)]
*  tentacles in the Middle East. Nobody has more tentacles in the Middle East than the United [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=730.56s)]
*  States at least Iran actually is in that region. The United States is on the opposite side of the [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=736.08s)]
*  world. The United States has not just tentacles but military bases and control over multiple Arab [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=741.6800000000001s)]

*  the Jordanians and the Qataris in order to do our bidding and we're actually there fighting as [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=754.64s)]
*  usual. You have to go back to the 1970s to find a decade in which the United States did not bomb [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=762.56s)]
*  Iraq just Iraq and you notice there that Ben Shapiro is complaining that the Iranians have [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=769.68s)]
*  their tentacles in Iraq a country that he cheered on as the United States went and packed up its [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=776.0s)]
*  military over across the world to invade and then occupied for the next 15 years. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=781.5999999999999s)]
*  But those kind of hypocrisies those kinds of discrepancies don't enter his mind because [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=787.4399999999999s)]
*  he's looking at the world from a very self-centered self-interested perspective. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=791.76s)]
*  Secondarily the American perspective primarily the Israeli perspective and so if you look at it from [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=797.4399999999999s)]
*  those interests in that order then you're going to see the American involvement and control of the [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=803.4399999999999s)]
*  Middle East is something that we need more of whereas somehow it makes the Iranians the most [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=809.28s)]
*  evil people in the world that they're trying to exert influence counter-influence in their region. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=813.6s)]
*  ...impact on the government of Iraq and their tentacles in Syria where they're allied with [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=820.08s)]
*  Bashar Assad they have their tentacles in Lebanon where they effectively control the government via [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=823.92s)]
*  Hezbollah they have their tentacles in Hamas they have their tentacles in Palestinian Islamic Jihad [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=828.96s)]
*  and they have their tentacles with the dhudis those tentacles are all over the Middle East. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=833.84s)]
*  Now one of the big problems that Iran historically has had is that Iran is Shia and a huge percentage [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=838.16s)]
*  of the Middle East is Sunni and because of that there is not a lot of solidarity between the Shia [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=843.2s)]
*  and the Sunni. I mean the reality is that whatever the hatred is for the Jewish state in the Middle [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=849.04s)]
*  East the hatred for Israel that's mostly a sideshow between the ongoing wars that have been happening [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=853.8399999999999s)]
*  between Shia and Sunni over the course of the past several decades. A multiple more Arabs and [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=858.3199999999999s)]
*  Persians have been killed in a variety of wars since the 1980s than anything that's happened with [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=864.56s)]
*  regard to the Jews and all the hatred of the Jews does is it allows for the possibility of some sort [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=869.8399999999999s)]
*  of cross-cultural communication between Shia and Sunni in the Middle East and that's what the Houthis [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=875.04s)]
*  are trying to do right now they're trying to rally support to the Iranian side in any sort of [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=878.96s)]
*  Shia-Sunni conflict by siding with the Palestinians because one of the things that's happened is that [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=882.72s)]
*  the Palestinians being an incredibly radicalized population that literally no Arab state will take [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=887.0400000000001s)]
*  in not only will no Arab state take in the Palestinians Arab states have expelled the [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=891.12s)]
*  Palestinians before in the aftermath of the Gulf War 200 to 300,000 Palestinians were expelled from [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=894.4s)]
*  Kuwait because they sided with Saddam Hussein in his war against Kuwait in the first Gulf War. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=899.6s)]
*  So none of the Arab states are interested in taking in the Palestinian population and so the [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=905.28s)]
*  Hamasneks went over to Iran and they worked a deal where Iran became one of their chief suppliers [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=910.4s)]
*  and it turns out that the Sunni states they have no interest in working with the Palestinians again [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=917.12s)]
*  very radicalized population destabilized virtually every regime they've come into contact with. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=920.9599999999999s)]
*  By the way this is why you're seeing Jordan right now issuing these very loud statements [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=925.4399999999999s)]
*  because they are deeply afraid of their own population 70 percent of Jordan is Palestinian [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=929.36s)]
*  So let me just say two things here before we listen to this last part which is first of all [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=934.24s)]
*  I hear this claim now all the time it's supposed to make you think that the Palestinians are [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=938.48s)]
*  subhuman and undesirable that even Arab states don't want to take in the Palestinians. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=943.9200000000001s)]
*  Now first of all one of the reasons why states like Egypt don't want to take in the Palestinians [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=952.4s)]
*  is because they don't want to help Israel in what is their stated goal in this war [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=958.64s)]
*  which is to ethnically cleanse Gaza by transferring all of the Arabs and Palestinians out of there by [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=963.04s)]
*  putting them into other countries and then taking control of Gaza. But the other part of it is is [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=969.12s)]
*  that when he says Arab countries don't want this what he means are Arab dictators, US supported, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=974.8000000000001s)]
*  US implemented Arab dictators who are there precisely to suppress the actual sentiments of [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=983.28s)]
*  the population. Like he just said 70 percent or 80 percent of Jordanians want their government not [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=990.48s)]
*  to be an American puppet but want them to be on the side of Palestine because there's a huge [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=996.88s)]
*  Palestinian portion of the of Jordan of the Jordanian population who is Palestinian. That's [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=1002.64s)]
*  why we have a king a a ruling family that we protect and pay for to keep that population's [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=1008.96s)]
*  sentiments from being expressed same as in Egypt same as in Saudi Arabia. So when they say oh even [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=1015.28s)]
*  Arab states what they mean are even the dictators that we control but the most defensive part of [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=1021.12s)]
*  this this idea that oh well obviously the Palestinians are bad people because no one wants to take them [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=1025.44s)]
*  as refugees is that after World War II there were millions of Jewish refugees who survived the [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=1031.68s)]
*  Holocaust in Europe and no country wanted to take them. There were ships that came to the United [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=1039.28s)]
*  States that FDR turned away during the war and a lot of them ended up having to go back to [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=1045.68s)]
*  Europe and dying as a result. The US wouldn't take any Jewish refugees and then after the war [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=1051.44s)]
*  the European Jews stayed for at least two years in horrific refugee camps that a lot of them said [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=1057.68s)]
*  were as bad as the concentration camps from which they were liberated except for the fact that they [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=1063.28s)]
*  just didn't get killed. But other than that it was the same kind of treatment they were in fenced in [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=1068.08s)]
*  conditions that were horrible in nature because no state would take American would take European [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=1074.72s)]
*  Jews as refugees. So if the fact that no Arab state wants to take in Palestinians as refugees [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=1080.32s)]
*  tells us something about the character of the Palestinians which is the point of this argument [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=1087.52s)]
*  to make you think that. What did it say about the character of Jews and European Jews that no one [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=1092.16s)]
*  wanted to take them if you apply that same reasoning? The reason people don't want to take refugees [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=1099.44s)]
*  is the same reason we're having such a fervent debate in this country about trying to close our [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=1104.64s)]
*  borders and why so many people in Europe are so angry about taking refugees including in [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=1109.3600000000001s)]
*  Ireland for example where they're furious about the number of Ukrainian refugees they had to take in [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=1115.44s)]
*  because it becomes a burden on the population. People don't want refugees in their country. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=1119.76s)]
*  But let's listen to this last part because this really gives the way the game of how Ben Shapiro [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=1126.1599999999999s)]
*  and his comrades are actually looking at this conflict and the reason they want [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=1130.1599999999999s)]
*  the American military so involved. Listen to this. Their kingdom will be overthrown. This would not [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=1135.9199999999998s)]
*  be the first time they had feared this obviously in the early 1970s. Jordan expelled tens of [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=1141.1999999999998s)]
*  thousands of Palestinians because of threats of overthrowing the regime in what was called [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=1146.4s)]
*  Black September. So the basic idea here is that if you are Iran and you are seeking to buy legitimacy [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=1150.0800000000002s)]
*  with the Arab street you polarize the region around the Palestinians because what you say is [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=1156.4s)]
*  look at all these Arab states they want to make peace with Israel so they can side against us [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=1162.3200000000002s)]
*  but the real enemy is the Juden. The real enemy is the Jews and if we all remember that then maybe [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=1165.28s)]
*  we won't have any Abraham Accords and Iran of course hates the Abraham Accords because it makes [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=1172.88s)]
*  them a more minor player in the Middle East. It creates an overwhelming coalition of force that [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=1177.3600000000001s)]
*  exists around its borders. That's the whole purpose of the Hamas attack. It's why the Yemeni Houthis [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=1183.2800000000002s)]
*  are now involved in a fight that really has nothing to do with them because again this is all being [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=1188.0s)]
*  directed from above by Iran. Now in all of that do you hear anything about the interests of the [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=1192.64s)]
*  American people, the lives of the American people? The irony is is that the U.S. is actually helping [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=1200.56s)]
*  Iran if that's really their goal, uniting the Middle East in defense of the Palestinians and [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=1206.9599999999998s)]
*  against Israel. But if you listen to Ben Shapiro talk about why this conflict is so important to [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=1212.3999999999999s)]
*  him, why he's obsessed with the Middle East, he's not very subtle about what his priorities are [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=1219.04s)]
*  and they really do not have anything to do with the interests of the United States or the [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=1226.24s)]
*  lives of the American people. And one of the reasons why I wanted to play you so much of that [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=1230.0s)]
*  is so that you could hear that laid out, that vision laid out, that worldview laid out because [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-LJl2RHXY&t=1234.1599999999999s)]
