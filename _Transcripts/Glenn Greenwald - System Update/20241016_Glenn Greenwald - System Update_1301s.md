# Nick Cruse: Kamala's Agenda For Black Men Is Another "Insult" From Dems
**Glenn Greenwald - System Update:** [October 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA)
*  It is always great to talk to a good friend of our show, the founder of the Revolutionary [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=0.0s)]
*  Blackout Network, where he does some of the most incisive and provocative and amusing [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=11.84s)]
*  commentary about the state of our politics, about the Democratic Party in particular, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=18.04s)]
*  but just the 2024 election in general. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=22.12s)]
*  He is Nick Cruz, and it is always great to see you, Nick. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=24.8s)]
*  Thanks for coming on. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=27.88s)]
*  Hey, I appreciate you having me on. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=29.88s)]
*  Thanks for the invite. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=31.88s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=32.879999999999995s)]
*  So, let's start with the decision by the Harris campaign, by Kamala Harris 26 days before the [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=33.879999999999995s)]
*  election that they suddenly needed to start talking about what they intend to do for black [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=42.239999999999995s)]
*  voters and for black men in particular. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=47.0s)]
*  It's like they kind of woke up after all these years and Kamala Harris was like, oh, I guess [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  we need to talk about black men because there are signs that they're not actually going [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=52.68s)]
*  to stay in line and do what they're told and vote for me automatically regardless of [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=56.76s)]
*  how I treat them. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=60.72s)]
*  So they unveiled this, I forget exactly what they're calling it, agenda for black men or [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=62.04s)]
*  opportunity for black men, and it contained a bunch of planks of what they think black [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=66.6s)]
*  men want to hear that they decided to announce and unveil less than a month before the election. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=70.92s)]
*  What are your thoughts on that happening and the platform itself? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=78.03999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's just another insult from the Democratic Party. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=84.2s)]
*  Their message to black men essentially was smoke some weed, invest in crypto and shut [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=89.32000000000001s)]
*  up. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=95.92s)]
*  And this is the general attitude of the Democratic Party. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=96.92s)]
*  And you did a great intro explaining how Kamala Harris is blaming the dissent that black people [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=100.2s)]
*  have regarding the neoliberal regime, the Zionist regime. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=107.28s)]
*  They're blaming that on Russia. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=112.4s)]
*  Apparently the only reason I started Revolutionary Blackout and I speak out against the crimes [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=114.16000000000001s)]
*  of the Democratic Party, the reason why I speak out against cop cities, the reason why [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=119.04s)]
*  I speak out against the war crimes that they are committing in Gaza, them bombing Africa [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=122.72s)]
*  and their use of sanctions that impact one fourth of the world's population. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=127.32000000000001s)]
*  Apparently according to them, Glenn, the only reason I'm upset is because Russia is brainwashing [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=132.04000000000002s)]
*  me. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=137.56s)]
*  The insults that the Democratic Party commits against the black people will make the Republicans [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=138.56s)]
*  envious the same way they invited George Floyd to the White House only to make a bill to [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=145.12s)]
*  give his killers more money. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=150.16s)]
*  The insults that whenever they want to talk to the black community, they bring on a celebrity [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=152.2s)]
*  to shake their ass. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=157.86s)]
*  They bring on Oprah, what's her name, the horse lady, Megan Thee Stallion, the horse [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=159.36s)]
*  lady, Oprah. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=164.62s)]
*  That's how they communicate with us. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=166.7s)]
*  Apparently there's no black intellectuals. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=168.26s)]
*  So we have two completely different approaches. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=170.85999999999999s)]
*  We want to see policy that actually improve the status of the black proletariat and prevent [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=173.57999999999998s)]
*  our black labor from being exploited. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=180.22s)]
*  Not crypto nonsense, not trickle down economics for the black community. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=182.51999999999998s)]
*  Liberals claim, Glenn, that they don't support trickle down economics, but whenever they [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=189.62s)]
*  bring up anything with the black community, they say, let's just give black capitalists [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=194.54s)]
*  and black business owners money as if that's going to address the needs of the black proletariat [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=199.78s)]
*  and the black working class. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=205.42000000000002s)]
*  The question we should be asking liberals is, what is the plan for the black working [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=207.14000000000001s)]
*  class, the black poor, the black Americans that hold record amount of medical debt? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=212.34s)]
*  They say they're having a health initiative? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=218.18s)]
*  What's a health initiative? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=220.5s)]
*  Are you solving the issue of medical debt that's plaguing our community? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=223.02s)]
*  No. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=227.10000000000002s)]
*  So that's the question that we've been asking, Glenn, is what is the real actual black agenda? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=228.98000000000002s)]
*  And they have none. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=234.5s)]
*  Well, this is I think you hit on something so important. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=235.5s)]
*  Last night we talked about this exchange that JD Vance had with Martha Raddatz about immigration. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=239.54000000000002s)]
*  And whatever your view on immigration is, and I personally believe that immigration [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=246.66000000000003s)]
*  does a lot of good for a country, that it actually has helped build the United States [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=251.7s)]
*  in a very positive way. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=255.61999999999998s)]
*  Nonetheless, there's no doubt that there are costs to immigration when it arrives in the [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=257.09999999999997s)]
*  community, that there's people's jobs who become at stake, there's difficulty in assimilating [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=263.5s)]
*  culturally. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=269.38s)]
*  I mean, these are things that have to be worked on. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=270.38s)]
*  But for people who live in places like where Martha Raddatz lives, there's no sense of [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=272.82s)]
*  that at all because that isn't the type of community that has to ever deal with those [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=279.06s)]
*  needs or those difficulties. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=284.06s)]
*  And so everything becomes an abstraction. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=285.38s)]
*  And the idea of wheeling out these multimillionaire or billionaire black celebrities, or Barack [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=287.5s)]
*  Obama, as though they have anything to do with the lives of black working class people [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=294.02000000000004s)]
*  who are primarily the ones moving away from the Democratic Party. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=298.70000000000005s)]
*  To me, what it seems like is the... [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=303.58000000000004s)]
*  Aside from the assumption that non-white voters and marginalized people can't think for themselves [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=305.90000000000003s)]
*  the minute they stop doing what they're told, the other narrative implicit in this seems [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=311.78000000000003s)]
*  to me to be that the ordinary black voter, meaning the black working class voter, the [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=316.18s)]
*  black middle class voter, the black poor voter, thinks and cares about the same things that [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=324.02000000000004s)]
*  elites on TV care about who work for CNN or Don Lemon or Van Jones or those kind of people. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=330.1s)]
*  Meaning, they care about identity politics, they care about symbolism, they care about [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=337.1s)]
*  social issues. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=342.54s)]
*  And the assumption always seems to be that black voters don't look at politics the same [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=343.90000000000003s)]
*  way everybody else does from a material perspective, namely, what about our jobs and what about [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=349.06s)]
*  our cost of living and what about our inflation and our housing ability and ability to buy [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=354.42s)]
*  a home. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=357.98s)]
*  And that is why they have so much trouble believing that black voters and non-white [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=359.46000000000004s)]
*  voters are moving away from the Democratic Party because to them, they hear Kamala Harris [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=364.90000000000003s)]
*  spouting all these nice phrases. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=368.70000000000005s)]
*  She has Oprah and Magic Johnson and yeah, Megan Thee Stallion and a lot of black celebrities [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=371.06s)]
*  on her side. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=376.58000000000004s)]
*  So why would black people not be swept up on this? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=377.58000000000004s)]
*  And it's like the assumption is that black people don't have the same lives as everybody [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=380.26s)]
*  else has and don't have the same concerns as everybody else has, say, in the working [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=384.1s)]
*  class or in the middle class or poor people. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=387.9s)]
*  Do you sense that in this kind of discourse? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=391.22s)]
*  Liberalism makes my skin crawl. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=395.74s)]
*  The making of June holiday, the Kante cloth, kneeling, that's not what the black community [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=400.06s)]
*  and that's not what the black pro territory, especially the young black people support. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=407.18s)]
*  We support reigning in Wall Street, the same Wall Street that collapsed and tanked black [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=411.58s)]
*  wealth and Obama teamed with Eric Holder, Wall Street and let people who committed financial [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=416.9s)]
*  fraud against our community go. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=422.82s)]
*  We want to see that kind of systemic reform. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=425.78s)]
*  We want to see the end of cop cities and systemic ways of stealing our wealth like civil asset [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=428.41999999999996s)]
*  forfeiture. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=436.26s)]
*  Now, you brought up immigration before, and I'm very sympathetic to the perils of the [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=437.65999999999997s)]
*  proletariat. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=442.78s)]
*  But I want people to look at what the ruling class is really doing. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=443.78s)]
*  The immigration crisis is the result of endless sanctions. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=448.09999999999997s)]
*  We spend billions of dollars financing Israel and their genocide. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=452.53999999999996s)]
*  We've sent billions of dollars fighting Russia and funding the Ukrainian war. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=458.98s)]
*  And you want to know the people who fund this? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=466.98s)]
*  It's the black congressional caucus, it's all the war hawks. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=469.62s)]
*  Every single member of the black congressional caucus supports sending our money overseas [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=472.86s)]
*  instead of taking care of our communities. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=477.5s)]
*  So it just rubbed me the wrong way for us to fight over crimes. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=479.74s)]
*  I think we need to take our ire and our anger out on the ruling class who created the immigration [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=483.5s)]
*  crisis, who implemented sanctions, who used our resources to fund their geopolitical project, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=489.82s)]
*  the global domination. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=496.58s)]
*  That is what's drying our communities out. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=498.53999999999996s)]
*  And you have the military poisoning our water. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=500.85999999999996s)]
*  And young black people, Glenn, understand this. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=503.85999999999996s)]
*  This is why young black people, as I mentioned before, the ADL view us as the biggest threat [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=507.5s)]
*  to design its project. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=511.94s)]
*  They view us as the biggest threat to the empire because a part of the systemic change [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=513.78s)]
*  that we want to see is the end of the empire that's siphoning resources from our communities. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=518.06s)]
*  So don't get me twisted. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=523.54s)]
*  I am sympathetic for workers feeling like there are not enough resources and understanding [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=525.3s)]
*  migration may have an effect on that. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=530.9399999999999s)]
*  But there's a ton of corporate bailout, there are a ton of actions of the ruling class that [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=533.18s)]
*  they engaged in that young black people see as well and we want to see systemically change. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=539.06s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=543.74s)]
*  And I actually don't think that most of the concerns about immigration are based on dislike [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=544.74s)]
*  or hatred of or a lack of empathy for the people who are coming to this country. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=553.4599999999999s)]
*  I really don't believe that. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=557.9s)]
*  I mean, obviously that's part of it. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=558.9s)]
*  There's some people motivated by that. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=560.42s)]
*  But I really don't think it's that. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=562.5s)]
*  I really do think that it's this idea that there are economic sectors that benefit a [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=563.9399999999999s)]
*  great deal. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=570.74s)]
*  When I first started writing about politics, the idea of open borders immigration was something [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=571.74s)]
*  that like Karl Rove and George Bush and Dick Cheney wanted with the Chamber of Commerce [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=574.9399999999999s)]
*  because it was seen as something that would drive down wages by making labor more available [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=579.22s)]
*  and cheaper as well. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=583.58s)]
*  And at the time the left, you know, labor unions and a lot of leftists were against [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=584.74s)]
*  it. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=588.66s)]
*  And I guess what I'm really saying is that, you know, there's this assumption that non-white [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=589.66s)]
*  voters vote on these kind of symbolic identity politics issues that typically you'll hear [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=596.98s)]
*  non-white elites who get invited onto these shows talk about or professional activists [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=603.5s)]
*  who talk about it that just have no connection to the lives of black people. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=607.3000000000001s)]
*  Let me ask you one more thing. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=612.94s)]
*  Let's say that, you know, it's so condescending and it's just so patronizing to have Kamala [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=617.7s)]
*  Harris of all people come out with this thing like less than a month before the election. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=623.62s)]
*  And especially for one of them to be legalized marijuana, which isn't just about telling [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=628.58s)]
*  black people to go smoke marijuana. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=634.3000000000001s)]
*  It's true that the criminalization of marijuana has been a sort of way to criminalize black [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=636.26s)]
*  neighborhoods in a way that, you know, white users of marijuana aren't subjected to, et [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=641.14s)]
*  cetera. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=645.94s)]
*  But at the same time, her history as a prosecutor was a very aggressive criminalization of non-violent [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=646.94s)]
*  drug offenders, including people found guilty of doing nothing other than smoke marijuana. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=652.3s)]
*  But let's leave aside all the cynicism about how this was suddenly unleashed and the fact [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=656.66s)]
*  that it's Kamala Harris of all people who's pretending to believe in these things. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=662.5799999999999s)]
*  If there had been this kind of more sustained attempt over years, not just to have policy [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=666.2199999999999s)]
*  papers like this, but to actually implement policies, that's the sort of thing that I [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=673.66s)]
*  do think might have resonated more with black voters than pretending at the last minute [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=680.02s)]
*  when you see polls with a lot of non-white voters leaving that you're going to do. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=684.5799999999999s)]
*  Do they actually think that people are that dumb that they're going to be fooled by this [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=690.38s)]
*  last minute set of promises that they just kind of threw together? [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=694.34s)]
*  Unfortunately, it works on a few, the low info voters in our community. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=700.14s)]
*  I don't mean that by any disrespect. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=707.02s)]
*  That's why I said that Kamala's laughable black agenda, and I dismantled it on the RBN [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=709.9s)]
*  earlier today. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=716.18s)]
*  That's not for me. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=717.18s)]
*  It's not to win over informed black voters. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=719.18s)]
*  That's for white liberals. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=723.06s)]
*  That's where the propaganda is to say that Kamala has a black agenda, and then they can [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=725.06s)]
*  trick people who are busy with their life. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=730.14s)]
*  Once again, I don't say that with any judgment. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=731.9399999999999s)]
*  They're busy with their life, but then they see some celebrity they like. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=733.86s)]
*  They like listening to the music. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=737.38s)]
*  They listen to their podcast, and they see some celebrities shaking their ass for Kamala [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=738.38s)]
*  Harris. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=742.78s)]
*  They see Magda Johnson. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=743.78s)]
*  That hurt. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=744.78s)]
*  I'm a big fan of Showtime. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=746.78s)]
*  They see Magda Johnson endorse Kamala Harris, and they're like, all right, I guess I'll [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=747.78s)]
*  support Kamala Harris. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=752.78s)]
*  Oh, she got a black agenda? [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=753.78s)]
*  That's the only reason why they did that, was to trick the black proletariat, which [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=755.22s)]
*  is why I got a channel. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=759.62s)]
*  That's why the work I do is to educate and have an intelligent working class. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=761.38s)]
*  The reason why the black community is in dire straits, racial income inequality is worse [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=767.62s)]
*  than it's ever been. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=772.14s)]
*  We're seeing the rise of cop cities. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=773.5s)]
*  We're seeing black dissent being cracked down on, like what happened to Chairman Amali and [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=775.78s)]
*  the Hulu Black Socialist Movement. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=781.9s)]
*  That's because of the mistake that, honestly, Gen X boomer black voters have committed during [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=784.78s)]
*  my lifetime, and that was voting for the Democratic Party at around an 80 to 90 percent clip. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=791.62s)]
*  When you give up your power, the ruling class has no reason to do anything for you. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=799.2199999999999s)]
*  Put inside the joke that waving legalized marijuana is, you guys know that Biden promised [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=804.42s)]
*  that in 2020, right? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=812.06s)]
*  They promised this every time they needed to vote, and the dumbest in our community [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=814.06s)]
*  fought for it. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=818.3s)]
*  They wave a carrot in front of us, and then once they see that we're willing to vote for [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=819.5s)]
*  them in large numbers, they have no reason to do anything. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=823.3s)]
*  The reason why they are begging and they give everything possible to the white suburban [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=826.38s)]
*  night, to white women, because white women voted for Trump twice. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=832.0799999999999s)]
*  White women voting is up in the air. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=836.48s)]
*  The political strategy of the Black Congressional Caucus, adopted by the Bernie Sanders left, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=838.48s)]
*  very unfortunately, of pledging your vote to a wing of the duopoly, and I guess it applies [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=843.9599999999999s)]
*  to Trumpers as well, without any solid demands, is an incoherent strategy. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=849.48s)]
*  That was meant to not only lead the left off the cliff, but it led Black people off the [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=855.76s)]
*  cliff. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=860.36s)]
*  So what I advocate for is what we've been doing on Revolutionary Blackout, engaging [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=861.36s)]
*  in mutual aid. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=865.72s)]
*  I don't believe in liberalism. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=866.72s)]
*  I think we need to take personal responsibility. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=868.24s)]
*  I'm not a liberal. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=870.96s)]
*  I think we need to organize ourselves, engage in mutual aid, form our own outside government [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=872.28s)]
*  and form outside political power, and stop begging the ruling class for crimes and take [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=877.88s)]
*  what's ours. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=883.4s)]
*  We need to organize ourselves. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=884.4s)]
*  Black people need to organize outside of the duopoly. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=885.4s)]
*  Speaking of the Kamala Harris campaign, the Democratic Party trying to fool people with [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=889.0s)]
*  these last-minute empty gestures, it's not only Black voters, and especially Black male [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=894.28s)]
*  voters whom they're trying to do that with, but also there's been these kind of eruptions [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=899.36s)]
*  of very melodramatic, empty statements about the ongoing support of Joe Biden and Kamala [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=903.78s)]
*  Harris for Israel and what Israel is doing in destroying all of Gaza and now attempting [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=912.56s)]
*  to turn Beirut into Gaza as well, which is that they know that there are a lot of Muslim [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=918.0s)]
*  and Arab voters, a lot of young voters, a lot of left-wing voters who are not going [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=923.52s)]
*  to vote for the Democratic Party. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=927.92s)]
*  Because of that, they're going to vote for Jill Stein or they're going to abstain, and [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=930.28s)]
*  it's putting their campaign in a lot of difficulty because they are in a lot of trouble in a [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=935.1999999999999s)]
*  lot of those states where those votes matter most, such as Michigan and Pennsylvania. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=942.04s)]
*  And so what you've seen over the last couple of weeks is suddenly AOC and Bernie Sanders [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=946.56s)]
*  and even Ilyon Omar, who are very supportive of the Biden administration, at the same time [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=952.72s)]
*  they accused of complicity and genocide, coming out with these more strongly worded tweets [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=957.44s)]
*  like, oh, this is an outrage, this is genocide, what's being done in northern Gaza, the Biden [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=962.76s)]
*  administration must stop it, knowing full well that they're not going to, that there's [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=967.32s)]
*  no chance that's going to happen, their words have no effect whatsoever and they know that. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=972.12s)]
*  And it makes it so they're saying the Biden administration is guilty of genocide and it's [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=976.5200000000001s)]
*  vital that we do everything in the next 27 days to make sure they stay in power. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=983.5200000000001s)]
*  So they obviously don't even believe their own words. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=987.1600000000001s)]
*  And then you had the Biden administration today that came out with this statement that [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=989.36s)]
*  If Israel doesn't improve their willingness to let humanitarian aid into Gaza, the Biden [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=993.72s)]
*  administration will consider cutting off their weapons or suspending arms transfers. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=999.1600000000001s)]
*  And luckily for Israel and for the Biden administration, they have a 30 day deadline, which means that [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=1004.88s)]
*  it won't happen until after the election. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=1009.6800000000001s)]
*  So it's so obvious that these are just symbolic gestures designed to fool Arab and Muslim [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=1011.9200000000001s)]
*  voters, left-wing voters who care most about this issue, young voters, and to suddenly [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=1018.76s)]
*  believing that, oh, look, if AOC is saying this, there's room in the Democratic Party [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=1023.4399999999999s)]
*  for this view. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=1027.96s)]
*  There's some movement in the Democratic Party to finally cut Israel off. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=1028.96s)]
*  And I guess my same question to you is how dumb do they think people are? [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=1033.0s)]
*  They've been doing this game for a year now, where Biden makes some statement or leaks [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=1036.32s)]
*  to the press how angry he is with Netanyahu and the money in the arms just keep flowing. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=1040.04s)]
*  Do you think this sort of tactic from AOC to try and fool people into thinking that there's [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=1044.84s)]
*  actually a part of the Democratic Party where that sentiment is vibrant and alive and these [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=1048.8s)]
*  latest gestures by the Biden administration are going to have any effect on the voters [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=1053.8s)]
*  at whom they're aimed? [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=1058.04s)]
*  For one, people like AOC, they are the most morally bankrupt people in politics because [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=1061.28s)]
*  at least the politically ignorant people who vote for Kamala Harris or maybe the people [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=1066.72s)]
*  who are in denial, at least they are not willingly voting for genocide. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=1073.24s)]
*  AOC acknowledges it's a genocide. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=1078.48s)]
*  She knows the crime of what Joe Biden has done, but she continues to support them. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=1081.04s)]
*  Now, this weakness of AOC, this mindset of the left is exactly what the establishment [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=1085.76s)]
*  and especially the Democratic establishment has taken advantage of. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=1091.3600000000001s)]
*  So it doesn't surprise me that they haven't made any changes to their policies. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=1094.96s)]
*  In fact, they doubled down and shifted hard to the right because in a time where we could [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=1099.68s)]
*  create a political revolution in the Bernie movement, instead, many people in the Bernie [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=1104.08s)]
*  Sanders movement then folded and instead decided to implement themselves inside the [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=1109.8s)]
*  Democratic Party. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=1116.0s)]
*  And now a lot of those people who pretended it was, again, genocide, a lot of the people who [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=1117.24s)]
*  made a lot of money pretending for a political revolution, these are the same people that [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=1121.48s)]
*  were supporting John Fetterman. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=1125.6s)]
*  These are the same people who was cited when Tim Walsh was chosen as vice president. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=1127.64s)]
*  So the point I'm making, Glenn, is the reason why the Democratic Party is doubling down on [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=1133.48s)]
*  genocide is because the establishment has called the left bluff many times in my lifetime [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=1137.08s)]
*  and the left blinked. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=1142.36s)]
*  Cori Bush, who's supposed to be the most progressive among the black leadership, she [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=1144.28s)]
*  supported sending 60 billion dollars to Ukraine and she wondered why the hood didn't come [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=1149.04s)]
*  out for her. So the position of the Democratic Party is unapologetically neocon that [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=1153.48s)]
*  peace is their enemy and their job was to disenfranchise and destroy the peace movement [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=1158.44s)]
*  similar to Obama. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=1163.48s)]
*  The question is, will the United States left allow them to? [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=1164.72s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think what the Democrats are seeing with nonwhite voters and black men in [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=1168.6000000000001s)]
*  particular, this kind of understanding of what this game has been all along, namely that [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=1174.4s)]
*  they just pledge their votes blindly every four years unquestioningly in exchange for [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=1179.48s)]
*  nothing. They're starting to realize that, no, this is not something we're willing to do. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=1185.28s)]
*  We're not going to be told that because Trump is worse, we're just going to give you our [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=1190.76s)]
*  votes no matter what you do and give us nothing. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=1194.24s)]
*  I think the American left, or at least the part of the left that stays loyal to the [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=1196.76s)]
*  Democratic Party, is much further away from having the courage to actually come to that [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=1199.84s)]
*  conclusion, which is why you see one of the most disgusting spectacles I've ever seen in [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=1206.72s)]
*  my life where words are barely sufficient to express the disgust I have, which is this [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=1210.76s)]
*  whole set of online left liberal influencers who have spent 10 months profiting off opposing [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=1217.32s)]
*  and denouncing what Israel is doing, calling it a genocide, saying that it's the worst crime [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=1225.6s)]
*  ever, that Biden is complicit in it. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=1229.96s)]
*  And then just turn around, drop all that two months before the election, first try lying [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=1232.8799999999999s)]
*  and pretending that Kamala Harris was somehow going to be better and different based on [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=1237.64s)]
*  nothing. And now when even they can't maintain that lie anymore, they're still just saying, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=1241.0800000000002s)]
*  like, yeah, we think that Biden and Harris are guilty of genocide, ongoing genocide, not [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=1245.3200000000002s)]
*  20 years ago, ongoing genocide. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=1251.8000000000002s)]
*  But we still believe you have to support them. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=1254.4s)]
*  We're going to do everything possible to keep them in power. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=1256.3600000000001s)]
*  I mean, I get the idea that you vote for the lesser of two evils. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=1258.4s)]
*  But if your line is in genocide, if you're unwilling to draw the line at genocide, were [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=1261.5200000000002s)]
*  you willing to say this person is committing a genocide and I'm going to do everything [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=1267.0s)]
*  possible to keep them in power? [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=1270.12s)]
*  That is one of the most craven and soulless things I've ever seen. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aag4SASFnPA&t=1271.72s)]
