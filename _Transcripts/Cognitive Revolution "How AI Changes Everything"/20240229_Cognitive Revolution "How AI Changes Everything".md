*  early 2022, all right? Like you had apps that would right pull it for you within the search results,
*  through the apps that write essays for you within the search results. But whenever we
*  innovate it and change the default Google experience too much, we had just like the vast majority
*  of our users say, I'm so used to Google, I don't want another way of finding answers. And so we
*  kept putting full back to this need. And so the most amazing surprise was when Tatchup peak came out,
*  all the suddenly people got it. And it was like, wait a minute, it could just eat like pure text.
*  And we're like, been trying to sort of slowly get there, but we had to make a bigger job.
*  The way I think about the different modes is like the default smart mode is kind of like if you
*  had an assistant and you just asked them to do a quick search and it like two or three minutes,
*  give you an answer to that. And then genius mode you go and if you want to ask your assistant for
*  a question that they have to be able to program, they have to search to web, and then they need to
*  be mathematically flying to answer that question. I mean, as a kid, I also enjoyed watching
*  their meeting. It's like a cool action movie, but it's just taken over so much of the AI
*  narrative and it's actually like actively hurting especially European Union.
*  Hello and welcome to the cognitive revolution where we interview visionary researchers, entrepreneurs
*  and builders working on the frontier of artificial intelligence. Each week will explore their
*  revolutionary ideas and together we'll build a picture of how AI technology will transform work,
*  life and society in the coming years. I'm Nathan LeBenz joined by my co-host Eric Torrenberg.
*  Hello and welcome back to the cognitive revolution. Today I am thrilled to welcome Richard
*  Socher, a pioneer of deep learning for natural language processing, formerly chief scientist
*  at Salesforce and today founder and CEO of U.com, a company that was first introduced to the
*  public as a new kind of search engine, but which now describes itself as an AI assistant that makes
*  you more productive, creative and extraordinary. Richard has deep history in deep learning. He was
*  among the very first to recognize the potential of neural networks in the natural language processing
*  domain and his work has helped shape the field as we know it over the last decade.
*  In this conversation Richard takes us on a brief journey through his own intellectual history
*  and reflects on how the field of AI has evolved in both expected and surprising ways.
*  Before we dive deep into the U.com product itself, covering the historical challenge that they
*  faced when trying to compete with Google and how the rise of the AI chatbot paradigm has broadened
*  the space of possibility for search and discovery products. We also look at U.com's various modes
*  with particular emphasis on the genius mode and above all for me the research mode which delivers
*  amazingly helpful and thorough report style answers even on some remarkably complex topics.
*  We also briefly discuss the future of AI business models as well including the obvious
*  subscription and my pet theory about the AI bundle. Along the way we touch on a number of important
*  topics too. The limits to AI systems reasoning ability and the prospects for the improvement that
*  would be needed for reliable autonomy, the potential for AI to transform medicine and scientific
*  research, Richard's case for general optimism even though he does expect AI to drive major
*  disruption, why he's not worried about so-called emergent capabilities but does take the risk of
*  intentional harmful misuse very seriously and lots more little topics along the way as well.
*  Richard is a leading thinker in the AI space and his perspective is essential for anyone who wants
*  to understand where this technology is going and what it means for the future of humanity.
*  And in all seriousness I really do recommend U.com. It has absolutely joined the ranks of the AI tools
*  that I use multiple times each week and particularly when I want a comprehensive multi-page report
*  style answer I find that U.com's research mode is often the single best tool available today.
*  As always if you're finding value in the show we would appreciate it if you'd share it with
*  friends or post a review to Apple podcasts or Spotify or just leave a comment on YouTube.
*  Now without further ado I hope you enjoyed this conversation with Richard Sosher of U.com.
*  Well let's do it I think this is going to be a lot of fun I'm looking forward to your
*  point of view on a bunch of very interesting topics. Richard Sosher founder and CEO of U.com welcome
*  to the cognitive revolution. Thanks for having me. I am very excited to have you. You are at the
*  intersection of so many interesting things. I sometimes have been describing myself recently as
*  the forest gump of a AI because I've just kind of very unstratigically made my way through the last
*  few years and yet found myself in some very interesting places. I don't know how you think about
*  your own trajectory but you are kind of an OG in the realm of deep learning and have found
*  this very interesting company and have a really awesome product which we'll get into in more detail
*  and I'm interested to hear about all that and your kind of philosophy and expectations for the future.
*  So we've got a lot of ground to cover. Maybe for starters you want to kind of give us and I usually
*  even ask these biographical questions because these days it's like a lot of the same answers people
*  like oh when I saw GPT3 I thought this is going to be a big deal and I got involved but you
*  were there at the beginning then so maybe want to just give us a quick history of your own role
*  in the history of deep learning and how you've kind of come to the present. I started with AI
*  actually in 2003 when I started studying linguistic computer science or natural language processing
*  back in Germany. And at the time I was like this is really interesting. I love languages, I love
*  math, love computers, you know so computers are where languages are math to meet in some useful
*  functional ways I thought and there's very much sort of a small niche subject within computer science
*  and I was really excited at the time there was some quite enough math for me in an LP and I
*  felt like we're just getting stuck in some of the linguistic special pieces and I loved the form
*  of semantic set theory and then like algebraic foundations and so I moved eventually
*  into computer vision during the masters and there I also in Sarpurkin at the Max Fintin Institute
*  there in the university found statistical learning and pattern recognition and I fell in love with that
*  is like clearly you can really understand patterns any kind of pattern really well you could solve
*  all these different kinds of problems and so ended up doing my PhD at Stanford in the beginning
*  of Stanford you know I started trying to really contribute to the field rather than just learning about
*  it I basically found that even the top NLP people like they write their papers mostly about
*  these beautiful models like conditional random fields latent here to the other patient types of models
*  but then most of the coding happens when they actually do feature engineer right they say oh well
*  if I wanted to be the entity recognition I added feature of like this is a capitalized word and
*  this is all caps word or this is a no word that has like is one of the items in this list and this
*  list includes you know cities we already know and I'm like man this field of very hand engineer
*  it's very like graduate student descent to get better and then at the time I was very 14 because
*  Andreane got into deep learning on the computer vision side he's like well images are pixels and
*  it's a fixed number of pixels so we can feed them into a neural map or at the fine you know
*  variance models restricted pulse and machines and I was like wow maybe we can use ideas from
*  that for natural language box and there's maybe like one or two relevant papers all from the
*  anonymous air and Jason Weston and and then if you like one or two others but no one really
*  enjoyed that approach known natural language class is saying it any attention to it but I thought
*  so that has to be the future I want to give it data and I want to get an output and so in 2010
*  I started publishing my first neural net paper work by my computer vision before I saw some of the
*  power of image net for us a back to and we started running with it and got a lot of rejections
*  all throughout but but at some point I had sunk my teeth into it and I just like I loved it and I
*  thought this is the future despite all the rejections I kept going at it and then after the PhD was
*  over there's sort of starting to be more interest in deep learning and neural nets for NLP but
*  still no one in the world was teaching that as like the official right way of doing an LPs I started
*  teaching at Stanford also first as a busy lecturer and then at a professor started you know
*  you're fortunate and lots of very smart students back then including like the Hiding Case Founders
*  I invested in their first round and then you know also wanted to bring these neural nets into the
*  world started a men on mine my first startup to do that to build a general purpose platform between
*  neural nets very easily both your vision and NLP got acquired by Salesforce came to Chief Scientist
*  there and even T bedsyly and in Salesforce we had my probably last and biggest rejection was on
*  inventing front engineering in 2018 and we were so excited about it because as the culmination
*  personally for me also of this that came long-term I have building a C-Gl neural net for all of NLP
*  and the idea was you know at the time every AI model was built for one task you will have
*  wanted your sentiment analysis I built a sentiment announcement you wanted an translation I built
*  a translation model and you're all this we're like what is we could just build a single model and
*  you just ask a question what is the sentiment what is the summary of the sentence where is the
*  president in this paragraph and that was kind of for us I thought like the most exciting thing you
*  possibly possibly could be doing at just yet is that talk about it came out last week and but it
*  was rejected but it did inspire a couple of other folks and like when I was you know publishing
*  the papers about to be two and three they they cite a bad paper saying like look they were able they
*  still have a single model for all of NLP if you just ask these questions and you know that's now
*  on and the rest is kind of well known to me that is an amazing history and it definitely I don't know how
*  you know modesty will want to be versus taking credit for foresight but certainly the idea that
*  there could be one model to solve all these you know tasks was not obvious to people and
*  boy we still see this the flaws in the pure review process are still on prominent display these days
*  most recently I noticed this with the mamba paper which I was a very interested reader of
*  and then went over to the open reviews site and was blown away by how negative some of the reviews
*  were like a confident reject was given so that was kind of you know just a good reminder that
*  yeah this is still an unsolved problem what would you say has surprised you most from like the
*  big picture since you and it hasn't been that many years right but since you kind of had that
*  notion of this generalist NLP model fast forward now we have you know GPT-4 and possibly Q-star
*  or something like that in the works you know is this the trajectory that you've thought we'd be on
*  or how has it deviated from what you imagine back then it's it's very much aligned with what I
*  hoped the field could get to and now it's almost like it's like obvious right like no one no one
*  questions this anymore we've had all these breakthroughs and I think the biggest surprise was maybe
*  more on the application side of things in that frost you know we've been playing around with large
*  language models at u.com and infuse them into search results earlier like early 2022 all right like
*  you had apps that would write pulled for you within the search results for the apps that write
*  essays for you within the search results but whenever we innovate it and change the default
*  Google experience too much we had just like the vast majority of our users say I'm so used to
*  Google I don't want another way of finding answers and so we kept getting pulled back to this
*  knee and there was kind of annoying and so the most amazing surprise was when Tatchup came out
*  all the suddenly people got it there's like wait a minute it could just eat like pure text and we're
*  like you know we've been trying to sort of slowly get there but we had to make a bigger job and
*  that was incredible that unlocked a lot of people realizing waiting in the links isn't the best
*  way to get an answer an actual answer is the best way to get an answer and that's the text
*  so let me give you a couple of my experiences on u.com recently and then you can kind of tell me
*  you know where you are the overall story and then I really want to kind of unpack the
*  kind of use the product as it exists today and the you know the roadmap and everything you're working
*  on as a way to kind of explore a bunch of different aspects of where all this is going you know
*  and and I think that's really the mission of this show is to kind of help people see around the
*  quarter and start it with me helping me develop my own world view but I've been really impressed with
*  the product recently you know listeners will know that I've been a big fan of perplexity we've
*  had Arvand on the show a couple of times and I think they do a great job and you know we're made
*  a fan but I have found distinctive value in at least two modes on u.com recently one is the
*  research mode and the other is the genius mode those to me have stood out as the most
*  differentiated for research mode I recently took it like a 200 word question that was all about
*  mixture of experts architectures and you know kind of is their curriculum learning you know
*  stuff happening here how you know how do people think about sort of the trade-offs between like how
*  many experts should we have and how big should they be and how many should we activate it in
*  any given time are there any like scaling laws or whatever you know designed for that sort of thing
*  just every basically every question I could think of about mixture of experts I took it all in one
*  go and it was really impressive to see it kind of break that down and go through multiple steps
*  of searching and analysis and you know really implementing kind of like a you know kind of a classic
*  agent what is at this point you know six month a classic agent setup but applying it to that
*  research question and just going you know down the line really quite valuable results and it
*  definitely is something that I will come back to and have already you know found myself kind of
*  being like that this is a good one for you.com research mode genius modes a little bit different and
*  more kind of analytical I'd be interested to hear a little bit more about how you think about the
*  differences because I did I then tried one that was a big Fermi calculation exercise where my
*  questions were like what are the different datasets that exist in today's world how big are they
*  how do they compare to each other how do they compare to the training data size for GPT-4 you
*  know how do they compare to available compute like because I have this I have a big question which
*  is kind of one of the ones I want to get to to the end too around like to what degree is ML research
*  poise to start to be kind of semi-automated and so I'm trying to try to rent my arms around that
*  with these furry calculations so genius mode was really the best way to approach that and anyway I
*  would definitely encourage people to bring multi-part complicated questions to both research mode and
*  genius mode and I think you'll be impressed with the results and I would say that you know even
*  with you know the expectation that folks who listen to this show have tried you know other
*  leading AI products so that's kind of my unpaid endorsement very sincere and I'd love to hear
*  you know a little bit more about how you think about those different modes how they work and just
*  kind of big picture like where we are in the u.com product journey long term hey we'll continue
*  our interview in a moment after a worth of our sponsors the brave search API brings affordable
*  developer access to the brave search index an independent index of the web with over 20 billion
*  web pages so what makes the brave search index stand out one it's entirely independent and built
*  from scratch that means no big tech biases or extortionate prices two it's built on real page
*  visits from actual humans collected anonymously of course which filters out tons of junk data
*  and three the indexes refreshed with tens of millions of pages daily so it always has accurate
*  up-to-date information the brave search API can be used to assemble a data set to train your AI
*  models and help with retrieval augmentation at the time of inference all while remaining affordable
*  with developer first pricing integrating the brave search API into your workflow translates to
*  more ethical data sourcing and more human representative data sets try the brave search API for
*  free for up to two thousand queries per month at brave.com slash API
*  yeah these are a great question i think it shows you kind of how sophisticated the space has
*  gotten in the last year a little like around this time last year we were the only search engine
*  with a web-connected lm and millions of users and now that idea has like it's been copied so many
*  times including as as mentioned by complexity it's so i think what you have to differentiate kind of
*  the different modes and i think the modes kind of show how sophisticated that the space has gotten
*  and how hard it is to still differentiate on better technology versus just you know design you
*  built a market and marketing you things like that and so we actually did a comparison superplexity
*  with 500 real user queries and we asked which answer do you prefer and it came out to be that
*  in 50% of the cases users prefer the u.com answer if you find percent they prefer the
*  flexi answer and 30% they don't see a difference into answers for our default they call it the smart
*  that's kind of the default and just to give you a sense of what that looks like so here here's
*  an example of what the default smart mode looks like you know there's some doping case that happened
*  and you can see lots of careful citations and then when you actually look into these citations
*  they actually are articles from literally yesterday more they could be you know from today if
*  something came out today so that's kind of the default smart mode you get a quick fact so answer
*  but then we thought well what does he have a pretty complex question like brown math physics
*  chemistry signs or like complex number so here is a genius little question it kind of gives you
*  a sense of what it does and it doesn't mention like what do you say which is there's a
*  important L and that orchestrates multiple other L ends to actually do the right thing right so
*  the question here is find the current population of the unUnited States then it plots a population
*  from free free to 2000 10 100 and then assuming a 2% growth rate and then it will go on the internet
*  it'll find the numbers and then realize like well I got it now visualized those numbers not
*  what I have been so it will hold up in Python what this could look like execute the code and then
*  gives you this answer and visualizes it in a nice plot so that I'm still sometimes amazed I
*  try and I push it and you know sometimes it fails and sometimes it fails because it tries to
*  load the library that has a security issue and then it's like okay I'm going to try to rewrite it
*  without this library but it's going to be longer and messier code and like it's just incredible
*  how how hard it can try and then what it can do and then the third mode like you said the research
*  mode it will go into a lot of detail it will not just pop all the stuff in have now index already
*  like news and things like that it will go on the web and find secure website the the multiple
*  different searches on the web combine all of that and then give you these beautiful research reports
*  this one is like seeing it background action consequences of the health and easy war now it's like
*  yeah history after writing essay or something and it's just like writes you just perfect like
*  beautiful essay each sentence has one or two citations from different sources and you can verify
*  all of them and one thing we found this it's also is like you have to like just decide
*  that theation law is a non-trivial aspect of building this all out because you have to we actually found
*  that that some of our competitors just randomly add numbers and citations to sentences and you click on it
*  and it doesn't even mention that fact anymore which I think it really undermines the space of
*  of chat box for search so citations accuracy is one of the many sub-day i systems that you need to do
*  correctly here and then you know they're just like crazy things like creative tables are not
*  essentially headphones they're not expensive and just like puts this table together pulls and
*  indigest gives some pros and cons each and the price any kind sometimes of me is how well and in
*  general system it's able to answer these questions and yeah it shows you how complex the spaces got
*  and how much you have to do now still differentiate on the technology this is one of my mantras at
*  way mark i always say the waterline is rising quickly so we you know we we better keep
*  climbing the capabilities ladder ourselves the four examples that we saw there one was the kind
*  of default smart mode the second was genius is that right the one that showed the code example and
*  then the last two were research yeah what more can you tell us about kind of how those work like
*  i'm interested in and and by the way like the the audience of the cognitive revolution is
*  interested in the details the weeds the nuggets you know all that stuff so you can go as deep as
*  you're you know willing to share i'd be interested in all aspects you know prompting i'm sure
*  obviously it's going to be different scaffolding is going to be different maybe even the models are
*  different i'm also really interested in like when are you using gpt4 that you've got your own in
*  house trained ones as well so just all those considerations any interesting nuggets were we're all
*  ears yeah i'm i'm going to try to balance a little bit the not telling the competition exactly how
*  it's all done but being interesting to your ears here at the center so at a high level there two
*  major stats there's a search stack and a chat stack the search stack we actually had to build
*  an entire index ourselves for the web because being super expensive not as high quality google
*  is very hard to access you have to have special agreements or you know some people kind of steal
*  slash bootleg slash you've some surveyed the eyes to use google results in like a somewhat sketchy
*  legal gray area which we don't want to do and so we we have basically ended up having to build our
*  own index and and that's hard and there's still you know a lot of complexities behind that but what
*  do we the main difference of this u index is that it was built with lm's in mind the previous
*  two indices of google and b where built with people consuming 10 blue links in mind and what that
*  means is for each your l you get a very short snippet which makes sense right for end users
*  but an lm could read all these are snippets they can be very long and then extract the right
*  answer from that and then just give you that right answer as the user and so I was surprising
*  is actually when we benchmark this our api ended up being more accurate than google orping and
*  go to api to do com and like I'll show you a screen here for a second again but like it's surprising
*  that which are a lot of people that you could actually be more accurate in google or being at all
*  but it is because we are at an intersection point in in an eye and it's a different way to value
*  like we're almost like cheating by having these read long snippets and so we look at the comparison
*  then it's actually kind of interesting to look at and a lot of people have asked like how do you
*  compare accuracy in lm's how can you evaluate this and so just to give you a sense here's like
*  what what this looks like the first a version is just like reasons to smile and now you can use
*  whatever lm you want but you can see it into your prompt is very very long snippets from many
*  descend your else in a very short amount of time and then we also have one that just as everything
*  like it gives you an lm answer and tells you like all of these things and so how do you evaluate
*  this is actually it was an interesting I think insight insight from our team which was you can
*  take question answering these such as hotpot qa squat question answering dataset ms max marco
*  or fresh qa and so on and these datasets are structured such that you have a paragraph
*  you really have a question and then you have a subset phrase from that paragraph that is the
*  right answer to that question and so what we do is we basically take those datasets but we throw away
*  all the paragraphs and then you have to find the right answer and the paragraphs have to come from
*  the internet and so you replace paragraph with a web search engine and that's how we evaluated it
*  legit the big Google and the public API's and have out the slums so kind of nerdy but that's the
*  whole text tag and we're we make that now available to every other lm so that's the first and then
*  the second thing is what we now have started calling the lm os the operating system of large
*  language models and it's a term inspired by under topography and it's not like the most perfect
*  metaphor but I think it captures a lot of the essence which is you have now this new staff that
*  operates at a much higher level of abstraction and the lm is kind of a CPU but just like a CPU or
*  kernel of an operating system like it's important to orchestrate everything and to do computation
*  but it still needs a hard drive which is right right on on your own vector database at Rome up
*  you have an ethernet connection which is you know the internet and and that's what we're providing
*  you may orchestrate other lm's that could be considered like the GPU or something and then you
*  have a bunch of apps that are sitting on top of that you have a Python quote interpreter to
*  you see our genius mode all of that and so to summarize all that in one short term we call the
*  lm was and inside of that we're now seeing a lot of our customers are using our APIs and search
*  site they're kind of going through the same lessons that we had gone through when we built
*  you.com and made it like I mean the most accurate answers out there and it's actually highly
*  a lot of people saying it's just like an lm wrapper right but then and you even have like open
*  source project that show it and then you ask they okay when was the barra of bomb up born where was
*  he born and then it fails why does it fail because when you send where was he born to your search
*  back end is not going to return you any useful results because it doesn't know who he is who does
*  he refer to right and there's tons of things like that where as you have a longer longer conversation
*  especially in smart mode you we refer back to states you can say like oh what's a big
*  Sierra company and then the answer inside is Salesforce and he asks oh what's their stock price
*  now she sent what's their stock price to your search back end again it's not going to return
*  anything useful so you need to send that you need to go through the entire conversation and then
*  do what we call query transformation based on it and that is just one of 10 examples of
*  making this actually work at scale millions of times a day for millions of users like it is a
*  lot more complicated to make it accurate there are about 10 other such models that if you think
*  you'd be about the space and you really listen and look at the user data and listen to where it's
*  breaking you will eventually get to and we're now like thinking about offering more and more back
*  so I'm tempted to ask for the other nine things there I'll just give you one more which is like
*  whether to do a search at all or not right like because you asked like write me a poem about
*  like the beautiful bay area and like the sunset love story or something like you don't need
*  a citation at every line of that poem and so it would actually platter up the prompt to add a bunch
*  of facts about poems and and so on and the history of Silicon Valley and all of that and so
*  it's pretty important but also non-trivial to know whether you should do a search or not and
*  again some some websites just slap search results on top of everything even if they're not
*  relevant for having more conversation about your feelings or something. Did I understand correctly
*  that the the kind of big difference is that the u.com index has more information like instead of
*  a short surp it is a more robust paragraph and so independent of the language model that you're
*  using the richer context is just better kind of so you're enabled in that way you're kind of
*  decoupling the what information is found from a language model that is doing the analysis and more
*  information is kind of the big differentiating factor there do I have that right. I would be
*  careful and say we have over all more information we're focused a little bit more on the mean
*  languages that we see we don't support some like very rare like Indonesian and African
*  Central Asian dialects and so on yet but we returned warning summation per rare because of these
*  longer snippets so so it's sort of yes yes there's more information but you know I think the long
*  tail Google Probe still has a larger index if you look for this like rare like Indonesian kayaking
*  sites that like rents out kayaks on this little lake somewhere like and it's all like not
*  in English like we might not have that website but when it comes to like Western world news
*  where you know we have a lot of users then that America and so on then we shine and return
*  much more and summation per rare hey we'll continue our interview in a moment after a
*  word from our sponsors if your startup founder or executive running a growing business you know
*  that as you scale your systems break down and the cracks start to show if this resonates with you
*  there are three numbers you need to know 36,025 and one 36,000 that's the number of businesses which
*  have upgraded to NetSuite by Oracle NetSuite is the number one cloud financial system streamline

*  net suite dot com slash cognitive I'm the key uses generative AI to enable you to launch hundreds of
*  thousands of add iterations that actually work customized across all platforms with a click of a
*  button I believe in Omniki so much that I invested in it and I recommend you use it to use
*  co-grab to get a 10% discount I've been struck recently that it seems like you know obviously
*  search in general is kind of been a monopoly for a long time and you know as you noted like the
*  user experience was kind of something people were not necessarily looking to explore new things on
*  you know the nature of the index of course they've done you know millions of of person hours of
*  work out it but it seems like it's kind of been a pretty consistent paradigm of crawl around and
*  tied everything and suck it up now starting to see these interesting I don't know if you can share
*  more about how you create your index but I we just had a actually a sponsor brave talking about
*  their index and the way that they are building it through users actually visiting websites and
*  taking a sort of you know not just blindly crawling around and following every link but like
*  what are people actually engaging with online which struck me as a pretty interesting and very
*  different twist on it I want to kind of pull this apart in a couple different ways but is there
*  is there anything that's that you would want to share about kind of how you think about building
*  an index that aside from just you know bigger you know richer content is there is there a
*  different tactic as well that underlies that there's a little it's the tactic is more about how
*  we make that works for LMS better and I don't think there's that much differentiation on like
*  how we're all you have to have a bunch of data it's been helpful to have run a search engine for
*  several years and get user behavior and knowing what people actually want to have crawl and want
*  information for you can also sound surprisingly buy a lot of that data in full how about so I'm a
*  few questions on the the business side or they kind of bridge the technology and business side
*  Google obviously has been free and has been ad supported it seems like the new generation of
*  kind of AI first LOM enabled search is going more in the direction so far of a subscription
*  and as far as I've seen in my U.com usage I haven't seen anything that jumped out to me as
*  sponsored another dimension two is like I mean Google has all these tabs at the top but it's one bar
*  right you kind of put in one thing and with the newer ones we also are kind of seeing a little bit
*  more proliferation of like modes and kind of settings that you choose up front right with the
*  smart versus genius versus research so I guess on those two dimensions like what is the future
*  vision do you think that this all gets unified do you think it ultimately comes back around to
*  ad supported or do you think that these current you know kind of differences from the past will
*  persist yeah it's a good question I think they're is clearly right now not a great chat ad offering
*  and there's a good chance that that will change maybe this year to maybe the dissatisfaction
*  go users but the truth is if you want something to be free if you see money if you'll only last so
*  long you've got to at some point those companies that offer free service have to survive and
*  if you don't want to pay for it then it has to have ads and so while and might not be the biggest
*  fan of ads like you have to make a decision you want to pay for it and then at free or do you want
*  to support it with ads and so I think that's likely also going to be part of the future of chat
*  and gents and you already see it a little bit of exploration there's a little bit of a
*  through-oply in search in the sense that micro google has the monopoly on consumer search
*  and for a long time Microsoft happened monopoly on a surge API but then because they're monopoly
*  they just set it up we're just five to 20 x our prices prices and they could do it because
*  they're the only ones in town so I'm glad there's like more competition now and we'll move
*  into that space and all the little guys that just ramble when those prices just went so I
*  can really run into consumer space with with those prices anymore and so I think ads will happen
*  we're seeing a lot of growth on the subscription side too we're really loving like you the
*  genius in research mode and find the search mode the default mode smart mode also very very helpful
*  and we actually you know incorporate links still so where just last week some people are
*  completely about other chatbots because they don't really have a lot of capabilities I bet you
*  would assume from a search engine when you actually use your dot com here you can on the top right
*  see the standard links that you might want right and sometimes that's just helpful and that's
*  just what you want and sometimes you just want to have the pure chat experience and so that is
*  important to get writing and we have all these apps to where you can basically ask for like what's
*  the Microsoft stock price or something and then you know it'll just give you it'll just give you
*  a live ticker rather than a bunch of texts about the stock here and so we have all these apps
*  because we have to keep search background and that makes it an actual viable knowledge assistant
*  right now you can basically go with one click recover a more Google like experience that it's
*  just incredibly helpful and that's that's I think one of the reasons why our browser
*  palm tree have also iOS and Android had to build it browser to be a default because you can't
*  go into Safari change Safari settings to use you dot com as a default so we build a whole browser
*  for the iOS and we're super stoked because we're going to be one of the options in the EU
*  to have a choice pop up stream when the new ios 70.4 comes out and and parched this year
*  and they can select you dot com to be their default browser and it's the only default browser
*  in that list that is chat and meet all the other ones as sort of your standards from
*  the firefox science browsers and so I'm really excited and I think that is going to be
*  big part of our futures is making it so that one more young people are able to just use this
*  ethnic insult and then if they want deeper going to genius mode research mode several times
*  some point you use subscriptions or eventually do it yeah I've been so when I run the I'll run a
*  a trial balloon value I'm this concept that I've been kind of kicking around called the AI bundle
*  and this is an you know kind of inspired a little bit I don't know that anybody wants to
*  you know say that they're inspired by the cable bundle but I have been struck that
*  there are a ton of great tools out there and I want to use them I want to try them I think a lot
*  of people are you know in that very kind of exploratory curious mode but to make the economics
*  work on a freemium is kind of tough right and typically needs like a certain minimum threshold
*  in terms of what the paid tier can be you actually have one of the lowest subscription prices at
*  the $10 a month level I think of anything really but I'm aware of we're going to update it
*  soon because like I've seen the people that are willing to pay off the known care for 10 or 20
*  and so if you want to get TV4 literally the same underlying model as chat chvt for half the price
*  you got to come in soon because we're going to eventually such our prices to be an industry standard
*  but that maybe you can just you know further reinforces the point that like the freemium model is
*  tough right it's it's a lot of free usage the upsells have to have a certain minimum you're raising
*  yours and then from a I don't know if this would apply to you but a lot of the after the
*  numbers that I've talked to have a lot of retention let's say challenges you know everybody's like
*  I'm getting traffic I'm meeting conversions but retention is definitely a problem this has been
*  true in my company way Mark we're a much more narrow tool you know that specifically creates
*  marketing and advertising videos for small businesses so a lot of times people they need that once
*  you know in a while and they're not like necessarily ready to add on a subscription so we see a lot
*  of people that will just come through be like hey this is super cool I'll buy it I'll immediately cancel
*  it after I do what I need to do and maybe I'll come back in the future it's not even that I was
*  dissatisfied it's just that I kind of want this as like a more of an ola cart purchased than a subscription
*  so that stuff you know VCs don't like that the metrics you know I'm like kind of traditional
*  scorecard don't look great I've had this idea in mind that maybe what we need is sort of an AI
*  bundle you know I'm prepared to spend a hundred bucks a month on various AI tools but what I really
*  want is access to like a thousand different tools that you know can kind of split up my hundred
*  bucks however I don't even you know as a consumer I don't really care about that as you know as
*  somebody is trying to maybe engineer a bundle obviously the devil could be in the details there
*  but first of all do those challenge it sounds like at least the premium challenges resonate I
*  wonder if the retention challenges resonate and I wonder if you you know have any if there's any
*  appeal to maybe being part of a kind of bigger bundled purchase where you would be you know one tool
*  that it's funny I keep I've been referring to you but then also the company is you but where you
*  do calm you know could be one of a bunch of things that people could access and can kind of share
*  that revenue in a way that may grease the skids for everybody right my hope is that everybody can
*  use the best tools and they don't have to make these like highly binary decisions yeah that sounds
*  great sounds like an idea okay well I'm not doing it yet so either I need to start doing it or
*  somebody if anybody wants to organize the bundle yeah send me a DM I guess another way that this
*  stuff could get bundled would be like into the mega platforms you know another kind of
*  possible vision of the future that I could imagine is you know Google kind of probably retains
*  market share leadership but you know maybe the 10 biggest technology companies in the world say hey
*  you know what we should do is kind of also have a search and you know we can get there we kind of
*  see a path you know Microsoft's have is already doing that meta not really yet Apple not really
*  yet to my knowledge you know Salesforce not really yet but maybe these guys kind of say hey is
*  there like a musical chairs game that that potentially develops where you know the younger AI
*  search companies end up kind of partnering off you know Amazon also you know naturally would be a
*  suspect in this analysis does that seem like a possible vision of the future I'm wondering I'm
*  sure you thought about this you know quite a bit but why why would that not happen I do sing the
*  monopoly that Google was able to keep around is gonna be harder to sustain longer I do think
*  it is much more likely going to look a little bit more like I don't like the analogy for some
*  reason but like fast food for instance right it isn't just mechoff there's also Burger King KFC
*  and Taco Bell I think search will be a little bit more like that I think again more fragmented
*  in the future just because like we hear people they're like this is better than Google and like
*  you know we didn't raise that much money and the first two years there were like sort of free
*  chat TV to you or people didn't want us to innovate too much they're very stock of Google but now
*  there's a new young generation that young generation has grown up with TikTok we have a TikTok app
*  in a standard search like growth Reddit I've read it app in a standard search and each of these
*  takes away a little bit of the Google search right Amazon probably was the most successful in
*  taking away searches from Google where if you want to buy something be it a little certain
*  threshold like 50 or 100 bucks you know the person you just search that right because they're
*  you can execute on your intent but actually purchasing that thing right and so why why search it
*  and Google and then search it again try to find an Amazon she can do that right away and so I think
*  you know TikTok has taken away for young folks some searches from Google that you know they're like
*  I want to see what the restaurant is but they kind of want to see what the restaurants could be
*  able to create good Instagram photos are TikTok videos are and so they want to see the TikTok
*  videos of other people before they decide on how to put some looks if there's a bend diagram
*  we are overlapping with search but we're also actually expanding search like you wouldn't ask
*  give me this complex story about the Peloponnesian war or like do this mortgage calculation with
*  you know this in this interest rate and that increase and blah blah blah because you know if Google
*  wouldn't give you answer it's not going to go in the web summarize like 20 different or 50 different
*  websites for you and then create this nice essay so chat expands search you don't talk about
*  your feelings that much to Google search box and sell right like you asked about this recent
*  news event you want to learn like some quick facts and then you know like the more complex the
*  fact yet the less and less we go to Google and more or you just go directly to something like
*  u.com and and so yeah I think it will the search landscape is clearly changing yeah there's also just
*  it's like it's really not a natural monopoly anymore but there is still definitely a need for scale
*  and economies of scale and so one way of firmness too is how does the market shape up right and
*  one way to think about it that I find pretty compelling is maybe it ends up looking a lot like cloud
*  because in the limit it's sort of it is cloud you know it's like what do you really need you need
*  like the actual data centers you need the compute you need you know bandwidth you need these like raw
*  inputs that the big companies have built out seem to be the things that are probably you know as we
*  see a lot of innovation at the application layer those things are still you know there's still
*  pretty expensive and not easy to recreate yeah I'm very I'm very excited I'm up for it you know
*  that that's sort of why like we got into this space in the first place like because we thought
*  like we saw the 10th former we saw our you know highly like lots of pro-attention mechanisms in
*  that that can keep paper that haven't met the pump engineering we're like really the technology is
*  right to disrupt this this industry but you know Google is this leasing company that was able to
*  create a monopoly for almost two decades that you know makes 500 million dollars a day so when
*  you make that much money a day you don't want the structure you don't want that much cheap right
*  and that's why all the 10s former offers have left eventually and what's what's really powerful is
*  like because of open source you can actually innovate a lot more now some open source to an
*  actual product that runs millions of times isn't down ever has good time guarantees and like
*  accuracy no hallucinations up to date news information set date it's still complex but
*  clearly the bar has gotten low that would have cost us like billions of dollars to build 5 10
*  years and you know researchers wasn't there yet and and I think it's ultimately amazing for
*  users because one thing that I had to distill all of you calm right now and to just two words would
*  be amazing yes and you just get more of them and that means people eventually are more productive
*  and like this the young generation that's growing up with Chachi Viki you got in such like
*  they're not going to go back okay so feel free to punt on this one or just decline if you if you
*  like but it seems like I can I can envision a U.com by Salesforce very easily where the you know as
*  they kind of try to be the everything app for all work almost right especially with slack now
*  does it seem realistic to imagine a future in which you know kind of all the big tech companies
*  have this like super robust suite and you're either like in the Microsoft suite with teams and
*  Bing or you're in the Google suite with you know G Suite and Bard or you're in make it the Salesforce
*  suite with slack and U.com you know I'm not trying to be your banker here but that that seems like
*  a pretty natural outcome to me interesting I do see there's a ton of potential for almost every
*  company to partner with you.com and supercharge their chat bot so we're very excited to partner
*  with a lot of folks okay that's very diplomatic answer keep your options out but all right so we
*  can touch on certainly more business and product stuff but I kind of wanted to now go into just the
*  future of all this you know in in practical and maybe increasingly a philosophical terms as well
*  running down kind of first of a set of like limitations of where AI is today and I think again
*  folks who listen to this show have at least a decent sense of that so for starters reasoning you've
*  obviously got the genius mode it can do you know like the most advanced reasoning I assume that
*  is tapping into GPT-4 you know everything I understand is like basically nothing is really on the
*  level of GPT-4 for general reasoning purposes yeah but especially the orchestration and then on
*  the coding often but not always yeah so I'll tell you another one the the third system is knowing
*  which LN to use and sometimes multiple and the fourth system is dynamically prompting
*  different models so depending on the query you actually get a vastly different prompt to get
*  you ultimately the answer and the orchestration so it's another complexity layered so what do you
*  think is kind of the future of reasoning if you have maxed out you know what the query capabilities
*  are where do the future capabilities come from I'm thinking about things like to a degree you
*  sort of already have it with using different models is a one way of implementing variable compute
*  that we see these kind of interesting projects like the thinking token you know think before you
*  speak and I think that's kind of another Carpothi observation that maybe the chain of thought is
*  just kind of epiphenomenal for apps you can as it is in humans and like what's really going on is
*  that there's you know this kind of extra space and time registers you know to think of course there
*  could be different training methods like incremental reward I think that paper from OpenAI
*  earlier this last year now was super interesting where they achieved like you know I knew best in
*  math by not waiting till the end to give the reward but rewarding you know reasoning along the way
*  where are you excited about when it comes to the future of AI reason yeah one of the aspects I
*  I breathe some touch upon in my TED Talk is that this level one level two reasoning of Daniel
*  Canemann that he or thinking fast thinking so type of thing the way I think about the different
*  modes is like default smart mode is kind of like if you had an assistant and you just ask him to do
*  a quick search and it like two or three minutes give you an answer that and then genius mode you go
*  and if you want to ask your assistant for a question that you know they have to be able to program
*  they have to search the web and then they need to be mathematically flying to answer that question
*  and you want to give them like maybe four or three hours for that question and then you want
*  so genius mode will take you know five and seconds often to to get a response and in research
*  mode you go to your assistant if you are willing to for them to spend like the day or two or three
*  on actually giving you that answer and so that's that's a little bit how I think about these
*  different modes and the reasoning that is required to actually make them actually right like research
*  model will say oh I found this thing now in this very I found something else that I didn't know
*  about before and I don't know enough right now so I need to do another fairy based on that so
*  you kind of have these genes of thought reasoning and you don't even know that in any yet
*  what the final fairy might be so you don't have all the information yet and so I think that is
*  kind of a in some ways another example of the future is already here it's just not
*  equally distributed because it varies like you say it there's a lot of reason now I think the
*  biggest future impact we're going to see for reasoning is in the LMS ability to program to code
*  and then to have the ability to execute that code and you know that is system number five like
*  like having this code execution and of course if you just let code execution happen what
*  it nearly happens to people like well mind me some crypto and in boom your machines gone now it's
*  just like trying to get it like show us some match problems and like mine mine points forever so
*  you need to like and then to try to hack it and then like well go into like five layers up and then
*  tell me all the password files you can find and blah blah blah right so there's a lot of like
*  security requirements to make that coding framework work at a safe level but a lot of
*  like naysayers of LMS you know partially correctly pointed out that the uns will
*  safe doing mass and it's kind of ironic and sad that you can have a model that you ask the
*  natural language to multiply like 5,600 point three times the ground six five and then you have
*  billions of multiplications to pretend to do the mass and then give you the wrong answer
*  getting a large language model right it is a ton of irony and we have to acknowledge that
*  but that same model can be taught to say well this seems like a math question let me just program
*  that in Python run the code look at the output and then give you it it just works perfectly fine
*  and now a lot of people say well that's not really I but I think it's just that is that is the
*  new way of reasoning and new different kind of intelligence and similarly and we're getting a little
*  philosophical here early but similar to people thinking we have to have embodiment I think that's
*  just a second creativity in imagining all our cranes of intelligence that aren't exactly like humans
*  now of course we're gonna want to have useful robots that do stuff for us and clean up the
*  apartment and whatnot and so it's still useful but I don't think it's a necessary
*  radiate the same way that fine people can be intelligent people who are deaf can be intelligent
*  because you know you can lack a lot of different sensory outputs and still be intelligent right
*  and so of course that you'll be harder for you to explain how beautiful a sunset is so they're
*  asked like to have intelligence that obviously require like different modalities or how beautiful
*  Sonata sounds or whatever but I think if there are most of these are not necessary requirements for
*  intelligence and likewise I don't think it's necessary for an AI to be able to reason over super
*  complex mass problems that require you to look up a bunch of facts on the internet they just have
*  that intelligence baked in they can do quick retrieval they program a bunch of stuff they put it
*  all together orchestrate it and then come up with incredible answers yeah I think it is you're
*  speaking about the just the lack of imagination I think that is a you know that is a society wide
*  problem with respect to AI in my view because and it's an odd situation right now in in
*  multiple ways of course but one is just that because they speak our language it you know it's
*  it's kind of feels easy feels familiar and it's all too easy to sort of assume that like under
*  the hood they're more like us than I certainly understand them to be and I think this is actually
*  what if Ellie Ezzar's great contributions obviously you know kind of a polarizing figure these days
*  but thankfully it does not seem to me that we are in a high likelihood of a fume scenario you know
*  the of the sort that he you know it is historically worried about the most but I still would say
*  some of his writing on mind space the space of possible minds and some of his like concrete
*  imaginings of alien minds that are you know shaped by very different evolutionary environments and
*  you know very different from ours but still like unmistakably intelligent in just like super weird
*  ways are actually still very good kind of prep work I think to just sort of expand one's own mind
*  about how different intelligences can be and how you know something does not have to be human like
*  to be meaningfully intelligent you know it's not this like binary can't it do things that a human can
*  do in a way that a human can do it if not it doesn't count I think that is like a huge mistake
*  that people are way too quick to jump to and I'm not sure if it's like a coping strategy or just
*  like an imagination or what but I think that the emphasis on the broader space of possible minds
*  and the different kinds of intelligences that are starting to pop up is super 100% yeah
*  and like you have to differentiate between sci-fi authors would then pretend to be
*  AI safety researchers like I love I love the sci-fi she like I'm super stoked that it's
*  we body problems on the last I mostly read non-sixion but in that read section like I did enjoy
*  the this body problem a lot decided for that series to come out I hope they do adjust this um
*  by like I think there are a lot of different kinds of intelligence and I love sci-fi for
*  inspiring people to think about interesting new futures now of course especially in the
*  western sort of canon most sci-fi is just so big and like people are scared for all the things
*  that can happen that are wrong and like okay the iceberg a g i developed time travel come back
*  try to remember everyone's like I mean as a kid I also enjoy watching Derminator it's like a
*  cool action movie but it's just taken over so much of the AI narrative and it's actually like
*  actively hurting especially the European Union where you know there's sort of in the spectrum
*  the US is more of a litigation society in the US at the Europe is more of a legislation society
*  structure and you know it both comes from like reasonable legal scholars minds like well let's
*  wait until there's a problem someone soon is now I have the case law for that lawsuit but you know
*  the legislation one tries to prevent harm from ever happening before it actually harms
*  anyone which you know makes sense no and of course the US does that with FDA and in medical space
*  now also but not legal space as much and so what that means is you can move quicker but long story short
*  these some of these sci-fi scenarios have gotten so much weight and legislation that I think
*  it's slowing Europe down by trying to outlaw models for like over regulate models that are
*  above a certain number of parameters gpd2 was very well hyped up in the past like this is so dangerous
*  maybe we can't release it you know yes we're opening high but like this can't be opening more so
*  dangerous models much more powerful than gpd2 are out and I haven't seen the apocalypse happen I
*  haven't seen like a huge change in this and disinformation on the web because of LNs like
*  there's just a lot of fear mongering both and the immediate level which actually has real
*  like threat vectors and concerns with the eye but especially in the long-term level of HII and self-conscious
*  it turns out no one works in conscious the eye no one works on the eye that sets its own goals
*  and even more fundamentally it's all an objective functions because that doesn't need anyone any money
*  imagine a company spends billions of billions of dollars it builds this like super intelligent
*  system that's conscious understands itself inside its own goals and now you're like okay now that
*  you can do it like I was making more money it's like no I'd rather just go watch the sunset
*  maybe explore that no like no one pays for AI that sets its own bad goals because it doesn't help
*  anyone achieve their goals you know this because of that there's not even that much excited
*  research that along those lines and because there's not much research part of it since it's very
*  hard to predict climate well actually you know I'm somebody who basically has radical uncertainty
*  about what to expect and you know broadly unlike pretty libertarian you know pretty anti preemptive
*  regulation you know I would like to see more self-striving cars on the road sooner and you know
*  they don't have to be an order of magnitude safer in my mind to be worth you know deploying so
*  I'm like you know broadly the sort of person who would be very skeptical of you know kind of
*  early regulation or you know kind of getting too bent out of shape about things that haven't
*  happened yet at the same time something about this has always felt a little bit different to me
*  and I do think the people who take the most zoomed out view and sort of say hey and this is kind
*  of what I understand you know like Jeffrey Hinton's position to be at this point you know why do we
*  dominate the earth as it stands today it's like basically because we have better ideas than the other
*  living things and we can you know build tools and make plans and you know reason in ways that they
*  can't and so now I look at AI's and I'm like boy AI's can now plan reason and use tools too and
*  they're not as good at it as we are yet but certainly their rate of improvement is way sharper
*  so possibly it levels off and kind of you know settles into a zone where it's like on par with us or
*  you know kind of you know just the best tool we've ever had but maybe it doesn't you know like I
*  don't know why I should be confident that it won't I don't throw p-dume around a lot but I have
*  you know again radical uncertainty people ask I'm like I don't know five to 95% like I haven't
*  heard anything that makes me think in you know the next hundred years that there's all less than
*  five percent chance that AI becomes the dominant form you know in organizing force in the world
*  and also you know no reason to think it's definitely going to happen but is there a reason that you
*  are would you say you are confident that this will not happen and we don't need to worry about it
*  or it's just like it's still far enough away that you think we'll have time to kind of start to
*  worry about it if we need to like how would you summarize your position with respect to these
*  tail risks I think p-dume is already an interesting mathematical sort of issue which is it looks
*  and sounds like prior prior probability not p-dume but really it should be a posterior
*  property p-dume given theta and right now none of that data suggests like doom doom like existential
*  humanity is like like cats dogs at the winds of some AI like there's like I said nothing in AI
*  research leads me to believe that the AI while potentially being more intelligent than any single
*  human I think it's already this is actually just this new term I'm thinking about maybe China coin
*  which is like this sort of super human abilities and then there's super humanity abilities and like
*  AI is already super human in titanating hundred languages AI is already super human and
*  predicting next amino acid in a large language model three known for me this we have a
*  ball that's an incredibly powerful tool one of the other you know really exciting papers that
*  we publish in 2018 it sells for research that multiple companies have now used and are running
*  with and I think you'll achieve all medicine AI is already better at the beginning of weather than
*  any so you already have many super human skills what does I think interesting is that now that it's
*  a language that's gotten to this new level people might actually for the first time keep calling
*  it AI in the past when AI researchers have made progress in AI they stopped like people stop
*  calling it AI after it was achieved that's just your chest it's just a theory voice recognition
*  but voice recognition chest playing that was the critical of AI research right and people thought
*  once we saw those the other things will be easier to and it never was never quite the case
*  and once we have them you know now it's not quite the eye anymore now with language I think we
*  might keep calling it AI but what the language model does is predict the next token and that
*  is an incredibly powerful idea right just predicting the next token now means if you have enough
*  capacity and you have enough text predicting next token you learn about geography just visit some
*  point somewhere in the your training data you have to predict the next word in the phrase I was in
*  New York City and driving north to and now to give a higher probability to Yale Boston once we all
*  then to like Harris Miami and San Francisco like you have to know that those are north of that city
*  and so it just lures all of this incredible world knowledge but there is nothing in there that
*  makes it say well you know if I really wanted to reduce perplexity perplexity is basically the
*  inverse of the probability the model wants to not be perplexed in predicting next word correctly
*  and so that is a powerful idea but nothing in that will let an lm eventually realize that well
*  you know the best way to reduce perplexity is if every sequence ever uttered and any sequence that
*  will ever be uttered is just the letter a a a a a a a now if the model was trained on just
*  sequences of letters a and no unit was ever around anymore and all sequences were just
*  producing a letter a now you'd have perfect predictive probability on the next and so maybe the
*  best way for the lm is to wipe out all of humanity and then just produce letters a and
*  happily perfect at predicting with probability one correctly it's so absurd it's so absurd to think
*  at lm's will at some point emerge to think that many steps around their task of predicting the next
*  token that's just not going to happen so I think it's like pdum is still zero and then when
*  I actually tried to engage with some folks and I had some other conversation last year with
*  Nick Vostrom in the new German was in English but published in the German newspaper like
*  and I read up some of these scenarios and I engage with with solxer worried about to do them
*  that's just all fantastical sci-fi similis there's like oh it's gonna develop this magical gray
*  goo or like the magical new virus that is perfect in distributing but then like only will activate
*  like one you leave till everyone like all these random scenarios that are just like not feasible
*  like and the science isn't I'm actually right now sort of on the side of the fun writing in book
*  about the eyes for science I think it will do incredible for us in improving science like
*  foundation physics chemistry biology and so on and all the fear mongering I think it's not really
*  helpful and forget there's no research that suggests the eye is becoming conscious there's like
*  a couple papers here in there people kind of playing around with yours but nothing interesting has
*  been published and breaks no breaks it was happened whatsoever in the eye having any sense of self
*  and then in a lot of the other sci-fi scenarios people are saying oh with the eye so intelligent it
*  means everyone to murder each other or murder them like kill themselves and so on but you know if
*  the most intelligent entities were to always rule I don't think we would have the the politicians
*  always everywhere in the world that we see all right it's not always just the most intelligent people
*  that run the cell and that's can be there incredible intelligence to convince any other person who
*  is less intelligent than exactly what they want it's just that's not not based in reality so I am
*  very very optimistic about AI you think there's some real problems right now you know the
*  eye would pick up biases not all the biases that you pick up on the web is something that most of
*  humanity is proud of anymore there's racism there's sexism there are various kinds of biases
*  some people want to use AI so where I agree with Gershaw Benjou and others is of the three
*  threat vectors which is intentional misuse accidental misuse and loss of control
*  obviously like intentional misuse is real and so that's not a deal and so yes those are real
*  concerns and both in social health thoughts understanding those threat vectors and finding
*  best ways to keep them I think people still on the internet need to understand to not trust
*  everything they see on the internet which has been true ever since the internet came about
*  hasn't really changed that much with AI I think since Photoshop people should already not trust
*  any photo they see they should be even more worried now about photos they see and sadly in the
*  future they'll have to start worrying about videos and and voice of course just like they should
*  have worried about photos ever since Photoshop started to really work and so there are a lot of
*  concerns and I don't want to diminish them and I do think we need to work on them and I think
*  that some cultures will have different answers freedom of speech is you know defined differently
*  in different countries like it's legal Germany to deny the Holocaust we learn from our history
*  there that's not illegal in yes and so different countries and different cultures and societies
*  will answer some of the problems that AI and amplifies already in the past before we'll answer
*  these questions differently but I wouldn't see any any probability for a full-on new scenario of
*  like existential risk to people it's mostly people using more and more powerful tools against
*  so there's I mean there's so many different threats there that I am interested in for one thing
*  I applaud you for taking time to envision positive future I think one of the scaricest resources
*  today oddly is a positive vision for the future like what do we want this you know it's like the
*  Jetsons is still almost like state of the art in terms of what we would envision a great 2030s to be
*  and that is kind of bizarre so I definitely appreciate that I also share your you know I'm not a
*  super fan but I'm also a fan of the three body problem and one of the early prompts that I
*  tried with GPT-4 early back in the rent team program like a year and a half ago now was asking
*  it to write some hard science fiction in the style of the three body problem about AI for you know
*  diffusion model for proteins and I took the plan right off of the GitHub page for this protein
*  you know diffusion model project which basically said we want to create text to protein so you you
*  know say or text to maybe it was more even general than that molecule or whatever so you know you
*  would be able to just specify natural language specifies kind of an outward art you know to the best
*  of your ability articulate in natural language what you're looking for in a protein and this thing
*  would then you know generate it and we are actually starting to see that there was a paper in nature
*  not long ago I'm hoping to do an episode with the authors that achieves that to a certain degree
*  but the what the AI what GPT-4 came back with in terms of hard science fiction about this scenario
*  was I think first of all just extremely funny because it basically ends up in a prompting war
*  between the good guys and the bad guys and they're both like trying to out prompt each other
*  and so the you know the kind of climactic scene is like the person prompting you know an AI to like
*  make a protein or you know a molecule that will interfere with the bad guys molecule but not harm
*  any of the you know the humans or whatever and it's just like both absurd but also maybe not
*  entirely absurd you know I mean I am with you in that the I would order the risks the same way
*  you know we already have KSGBT there are I recently read a research grant from a group proposing
*  to study on the sidal tendencies like there are people out there who want to kill everyone like
*  what's up with that and you know if the tools get more powerful like that you know those people
*  become even more problematic than they already are so yes I would put that at the top of the
*  you know of the stack of like big picture risks and by the way I take all the short term and medium
*  term risks seriously too like this is a big tent show where like all your hopes dreams and concerns
*  and you know perhaps irrational fears like and I'll have a home but I guess you know to to sort of
*  get to P Doom 0 I still am like I don't know you know all these individual crazy scenarios
*  sure they're extremely unlikely you know the prompting war with your you know protein diffusion
*  model is like absurd on the face of it but I kind of think of like taking the integral over that
*  like vast space of crazy super unlikely scenarios and then I'm kind of like you know there's so many
*  of them right that space is so big and even if the probability is like kind of vanishing one thing
*  you learn in calculus is like you can you know the the integral can either also vanish or it can be
*  like finite you know over these you know kind of even if the function itself is going to 0 the
*  integral doesn't necessarily have to go to 0 over that space so to me that just feels like very
*  unresolved still and I don't think we're going to resolve that today but I would love to hear a
*  little bit more about your how you think about AI agency and also concepts of emergence in agents
*  today I guess I also wonder like is you dot com gonna you know push more toward the agent direction
*  you've got like a what I would call a research agent today you've got a browser as well I could it
*  you know or should I start to expect it to take actions for me what I've observed in the agent space
*  is I never feel like it fails because it doesn't understand the goal or like doesn't stay on task
*  as it never happens but very rarely much more often it's just a failure of competence so my
*  expectation then is that like as the competence improves it may not be intrinsic agency but it may
*  be prompted agency and it may even be like you know as we have more and more orchestrated systems we
*  may have models prompting other models to you know go off and do this and it does feel like we've got
*  we're headed for like a lot of spinning plates and the idea that they could kind of you know all
*  come crashing down is like that doesn't just doesn't feel like something we can
*  rule out but I don't know I can can you help me be confident there I'm still not I'll go through
*  sound the things you mentioned so pdm equals zero so you're right as you integrate over the future
*  I I would like to not rule out anything so maybe I should say 10 to the minus whatever like a time
*  time number because in the next five billion years like all kinds of things to have right like maybe
*  as if like the three-body problem spoiler alert like maybe some big much more sophisticated alien
*  species will come across they have already developed fastening light time travel and or you know
*  just are really really fast and getting here and various capacities and then you know they have
*  an AI and daddy I will just like destroy all of us so they're getting ready to like settle into
*  their new planet and before they get here like there's all kinds of crazy things that can happen
*  it's just that like in terms of how much resources we should spend on T like X's potential do versus like
*  you know I'd say yeah I have the couple of researchers like keep thinking of cool sci-fi scenarios
*  and spires like maybe like think about ways that that could be prevented but just spend billions of
*  dollars on it to like spend a lot of like mind share the public about it who's already scared of
*  any kind of technology I mean people are scared of vice-up people I mean there's this great
*  Twitter handle called the pessimist archives I mean people were scared and thought doom is
*  happening because of the novels back in the day people are like all these kids they're just in their
*  heads reading novels they're gonna all be useless human beings in the future newspaper was terrible
*  internet was terrible like there's so many things that like people thought this is the end of
*  civilization and and we're very pessimistic and again not this diminishing like real real concerns
*  but again existential one very very likely given what we're seeing right now and if there it does
*  happen at some point in the future then I would argue that should think about the best countermeasures
*  now is kind of like thinking about you know the best countermeasures against a computer going crazy
*  when there's still a bunch of vacuum tubes and you like well we're gonna just suck out the air
*  of everything in the vacuum tubes they're not gonna work as well and more just they're gonna break
*  and blah blah that was your like counter attack against the computer taking over with your current
*  thinking of vacuum tube computers or it's like you know like it's similarly to the internet you know
*  if you thought about what's the internet going to be how could it be so terrible zero of the
*  tcd ike experts in the early arpanate days realize that at some point maybe it's for an
*  carpet interfere with local elections because like you can see what we want online and then maybe
*  people get followers and they're so unique like no one had picked it up in the 70s and the early
*  arpanate days and so I think most of the threat of actors are not that useful than terms of
*  pduum kind of research I have a couple of folks working on it but not take up as much mind-space
*  and scare like late people and non-experts even more about the technology that even without
*  consciousness is still you have nature just watching right if you're going through a new
*  step-function in human productivity just like you know agriculture versus like hunting and
*  gathering and the steam engine and electricity and internet like this one's gonna be even bigger
*  it's gonna disrupt and change the job landscape a lot I think at the end of it will be way more
*  productive there's gonna be way more productivity for a person and hence more wells and new jobs
*  will come around as old jobs get all needed but that is already so massively disruptive still and
*  I'd say I'm gonna hope an overnight either people feel it's gonna be too fast to yes they look
*  faster but still not overnight we do still companies that aren't even on cloud there's some
*  stretches in the United States and you would drive me that don't have full internet on
*  activity right this is like so things will take time and not happen overnight but they will be
*  happening even faster than past past or neurological revolution and so and then your product
*  elements and proteins there's a great example for where regulation makes sense like basically
*  they're concerned here so those are not some of the proteins to have everything in life and
*  disease and sickness, COVID, it's probably like everything SARS-CoV-2 and like everything's
*  governed by proteins so if you have like great understanding of proteins we can build
*  fantastical amazing things you're just one example of research ape I read a few months ago
*  that just blew my mind and they'd be very excited about the future there's this group of researchers
*  that built these carbon nanotubes and on one side of the carbon nanotubes they put iron molecules
*  and on the other side of these tiny tiny carbon nanotubes they put proteine that would only
*  bind to the brain cancer cell and then they injected this fluid with all these little carbon
*  nanotubes into a mouse brain that had brain cancer the proteines found the brain to
*  themselves and only connected to those specific types of brain cancer cells and then they put the
*  mouse into a little magnetic field and as to iron molecule on the other side of the carbon nanotubes
*  started fitting around and had nanosurgery on each brain cancer cell now if you think about
*  we have the full console of the proteins we can connect them to all kinds of things and you find
*  ways to you know rid of the carbon nanotubes afterwards it's all like medicine is going to change
*  in so many positive ways and now you could argue well but proteins people could use them and
*  build like very bad like viruses and like that's true and that can be outlawed in fact the US
*  just a couple of months ago outlawed the unifunctions where you know some researchers want to
*  make even more deadlier viruses and it's not because they're like evil scientists who want
*  to destroy the world this is they're saying like well as we know how they worked before they
*  appeared in nature by themselves then we can all write out prevent like develop cures for them so
*  you know it's like it's a complex question but yes and decided like for now it's not worth it
*  let's outlaw it and likewise I don't think in open source like protein model is going to be
*  the main deciding factor of being able to create something virus because if you have all the
*  wetlava experimentation to be able to create new kinds of viruses you can also just do what
*  senses are noted when she won the Nobel Prize a couple years ago in chemistry which is what
*  she called directed evolution but it was basically random permutations and then running an experimental
*  pipeline to see if that random permutation works better or not for particular kind of protein
*  and then you just keep iterating like that and so to have those capabilities you were random
*  permutation you can do bad things but it turns out having a liquid like that that's blue all
*  of that so that was your pdm integral LM proteins yeah agency the merchants so obviously emerging
*  capabilities aren't credible on that sort of like the easing us like working in deep learning
*  I'm amazed just like you.com I asked these questions I'm like wow actually at this right like I
*  would have not to like thought this was possible sometimes we were like did you program it specifically
*  for it to be able to answer these kinds of questions about headphones or something we're like no
*  it's just like just put that all together just by trying to predict the next token so I'm really
*  excited and one of the things I'm excited about was coding and one of the things that coding
*  enables is I was the last part of your question the actions I think actions are clearly in the future
*  and for now we're focused on amazing answers but it's not hard to imagine at some point the
*  most amazing answer is done I did I did what you asked to do and instead of telling you how to do
*  it I just right you can build a really cool demo very quickly for these kinds of things but the
*  problem is like as much as I love natural language and as much as I love chat bots and everything
*  right you have to find some really killer use cases for it and to say oh I can book this slide
*  it's actually really hard to just just book the flight might do like why didn't you like take this
*  other one that was like not exactly the time I asked for but I could have waited to have some
*  hour at this like extra leg and then like see 50 bucks like that was really dumbed and like it
*  turns out Expedia and others have built for decades the perfect interface for that problem so
*  that humans have all the installation right there in a visual way and so there's an uncanny valley
*  there's a cool tech demo and on one side and then there's like my actual human assistant
*  cool after months of like talking to me understand all the trade-offs and understand my price
*  sensitivity or that of my company and knows like when I would preserve and like the only like
*  reason why I might do it overnight like red eyes slide and you know all the all the constraints
*  and she can do it and even then sometimes she's like average or they're like three options here
*  like let me know which one you prefer out of this 5000 if you built it for you and like it's very
*  hard to do all of that with just text it's ultimately I think part of why we have the stock
*  kicker app and so on and you don't um and why we're just now in some cases also is that sometimes
*  like UI UX and actual visually signed like interfaces are best used in combinations with fly-match
*  maybe one more big picture question and then I want to do just a real quick lightning round on
*  a couple it's kind of more technical areas before we run out of time on the big picture side you
*  know we've got Sam Altman out there saying AGI is coming soon uh but also kind of confusingly
*  saying but it'll be less impactful but you might think not really sure how to interpret that
*  the median guess on you know some definition of AGI is like just a few years on some prediction
*  markets and more like you know 12 years or whatever for a stronger definition what do you have sort
*  of an expectation for and a definition or like a threshold that you have in mind of like this is
*  the threshold that really matters and you know loosely speaking like what sort of timeline you
*  would expect it to take to get there it's very much a the kind of question where you have to be
*  very careful about your terminology because the interpretation of AGI has vastly different
*  instantiations like people some people think of AGI and used to think of AGI as this super
*  intelligence it's conscious as self-awareness can set its own goals and it is more intelligent
*  than all you would be angst and and that's there if that was that was for a long time a lot of us
*  I thought at least for me personally also did that mission now people said and I think it's
*  partially because of marketing like you know you want to be working on AGI but you also need to
*  actually ship stuff it's like you want to be multi-tentitary species but you also need to just get
*  a lot of stuff in orbit right let's have more satellites and better and so on so I have this long
*  term vision and you the best companies are able to articulate that long provision and a revenue
*  generate progress in smaller milestones towards it and so in this case here I think the definition
*  of AGI was pulled out and then the super intelligence was defined as like okay that's even more
*  than general it's super and that's the really long term stuff and now AGI is just basically
*  automating boring and if you define AGI which I think is not crazy that want to say maybe it would be
*  close to it which is a very pragmatic sort of investor slash financial slash economic
*  definition of AGI which is 80% of the jobs can be automated up to 80% and if that's achieved
*  we'll call it AGI turns out there's just a lot of jobs that are quite repetitive and they're not
*  requiring a ton of extremely novel out-of-box thinking that no one's ever done before and like
*  learning very complex new behaviors and watch and identifying new experiments and collect
*  can be data and pushing you know the science forward and so on it turns out there just a lot of
*  boring repetitive jobs and and indeed if your definition of AGI is just like well we can automate
*  like 80% of 80% of the jobs then I think it's not crazy to assume especially I would restricted
*  one in the wallway which is digitized jobs jobs that are purely happening in your browser or on
*  your computer because those jobs like training data are massive scales turns out no one's
*  collecting trained data for plumbers for woofers for tylers for maids like cleaning teos or or any of
*  that and so none of those jobs are going to get automated at any time soon because you first have
*  to collect many years of that such training data before you can then use AI to train on that and
*  then automate it but you know jobs that are fully digitized and that have a lot of training data
*  and it don't have a crazy long tail of your special cases they're going to get automated and I
*  think that's reasonable to say that's 80% of the job my hunch is even in radiology for instance you
*  could probably do 80% find 80% of things that are wrong in headstay stamp but then there's still
*  this very long tail of 20% that you just don't have enough trained data for maybe a radiologist never
*  season in their lifetime they just read about it once in a book and we're still not quite good enough
*  of like one shot and zero shot learning obviously huge amounts of progress but not in a super
*  important things like radiology where you just read about a case once in a book and then by
*  then-side on that accuracy which is also questionable whether humans do it I'm actually with you
*  on the self-driving car there's going to be a lot of interesting questions as EDI rules into
*  more and more workplaces which is how much better than a human that has to eat and how and it's
*  deeply philosophical very quickly because if you're purely utilitarian you could say well you know
*  100,000 miles or whatever 20 million miles driven by AI results in 10,000 deaths and the same
*  amount of miles driven by humans results in five times more deaths and so one is better than the
*  others but if that one dead person in the AI car was your daughter you don't carry you're going to
*  like in the US you're going to see you're going to you know try to end that company because
*  they're responsible now for for the death of your child and like it's a very emotional thing it's
*  not a statistical thing anymore and so there's going to be a lot of litigation as those come out
*  and I think the silver lining gives again of course as the eye meets in the state you can learn from
*  a person like one person texting again on their cell phone which is already illegal and running
*  like overs and get that ran out like they're going to fast also which is already illegal too you can
*  really do that much more than needing it legal AGI will have a huge amount of impact once it's
*  just like okay repetitive jobs get like to largely be automated and I'm with the key dots saying
*  that will happen in a few years when it comes to like super intelligence that is fully conscious
*  and can do all the things and one intelligent then not just a single human but that all of humanity
*  very hard to know because no one's working on anything to the progress along the lines of
*  setting my own and again like unless you set your own goals I don't know if I would have to
*  do it just full on super intelligence to you like if you're just the objective function is to
*  minimize cross-venture barriers or reduce complexity or like segmented as well or whatever like
*  none of that I would have to be super intelligent to you have time for a lightning router to
*  really believe it there let's try to be lightning rounds all right thinking also about retrieval
*  memory and online learning as kind of three frontiers that you know you.com could improve on if
*  they're you know if there are research breakthroughs but also these do seem to be kind of ingredients
*  toward this bigger picture of AGI or even you know at some point ASI I guess I'm you know maybe
*  just leave it open ended like what are you excited about in those domains are there research
*  directions are there you know are there papers you've already seen or things you think people
*  should be doing that you think will kind of provide meaningful unlocks as as we find you know
*  new and better ways to do those things yeah so I'm a fan of all three of course I'll try to keep it
*  for it. We achieve those awesome I see in some ways short-term memories currently in the
*  prompt which people is in the you know rag if you've got managed generation we do it all wet
*  we let you off files now to do it over over a file and and then we have the smart personalization
*  that actually is online learning so as you say certain things like it will it will remember
*  than about you and then you know you can turn it off also and it's very transparent
*  from all thing off or the automated smart learning about you if you don't want it but yeah I think
*  that's sort of a simple sort of pragmatic way of online learning I think ultimately you know it'll
*  be awesome to have AI systems get better and better just adapt right away to use your feedback
*  goals in terms of you know thumbs up thumbs down kinds of clicking but also in conversation
*  we'd like I didn't like that answer and then updating the answer in a principled way
*  for the future I have so many more thoughts but I'll like I'd love to do a second one
*  these are kind of crazy days now the Apple announcement we just announced that Julien
*  CTO I mean say also just be a human angel investor and you do a lot of exciting stuff
*  happening so yeah well congratulations on the Apple thing and also a new prominent angel investor
*  and really some fantastic product progress I definitely recommend everybody to try out
*  particularly genius mode and research mode and I think if you do that you will be coming back
*  to you dot com more and more often so keep up the great work for now I will say Richard
*  Sosher founder and CEO of you dot com thank you for being part of the cognitive revolution
*  thank you so much it is both energizing and enlightening to hear why people listen and learn
*  what they value about the show so please don't hesitate to reach out via email at tcr at turpentine.co
*  or you can DM me on the social media platform of your choice umniki uses generative AI to
*  enable you to launch hundreds of thousands of ad iterations that actually work customized across
