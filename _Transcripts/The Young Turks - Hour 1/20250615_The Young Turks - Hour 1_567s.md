"If you‚Äôre ever at a bar wondering if someone is Gen Z or a millennial, just keep tabs on how they pay for their drinks.
Zoomers are purportedly averse to opening up bar tabs, preferring to close out and swipe their cards after every drink ‚Äî no matter how many they end up having.

# Gen Z Has A WEIRD Habit At Bars
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE)
*  Bartenders are increasingly getting frustrated with Gen Z bar goers. Apparently they have this [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=0.0s)]
*  habit that bartenders who tend to be more on the millennial end of things, find super annoying, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  time consuming, and they want them to stop doing this. But I actually side with Gen Z. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=14.4s)]
*  So what is this about? They don't like to open a tab at the bar. They want to close out after they [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=19.68s)]
*  buy every drink. And to that I say, good people, I do the same thing. I don't want to open a tab. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=26.32s)]
*  And it's because I have this fear that I'm going to forget my card and then I'm gonna have to come [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=33.04s)]
*  back. And also when I'm ready to leave, I'm ready to leave. I don't want to wait by the bar. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=41.84s)]
*  When I'm ready to leave, I'm really ready to leave. So sometimes the bar gets crowded and you have to [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  wait for a long time to get your, I just want to close out. Why is it such a problem? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=56.64s)]
*  So I'm gonna read some comments to you from members of Gen Z. First, let's take a quick look [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=61.44s)]
*  at this graph. So Gen Z, the more sober generation, so they're actually not big drinkers [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=67.6s)]
*  the way millennials were. And you can see that represented in this graph. So that's really [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=75.12s)]
*  interesting. They have different views on drinking. It might have something to do with [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=83.04s)]
*  things like recreational marijuana legalization. I don't know, I'm just guessing. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=87.68s)]
*  But nonetheless, according to the New York Times, Gen Z have become accustomed to one and done [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=91.28s)]
*  transactions, usually with a simple tap of their phones and consider purchasing drinks at a bar to [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=96.56s)]
*  be no different from, say, buying a coffee at a cafe. They can feel anxious about losing track of [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=102.88000000000001s)]
*  their spending by leaving their credit cards behind the bar. And so I'll read you some quotes. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=110.96s)]
*  One person says, my God, 26 year olds consider Gen Z. Okay, why leave a credit card with the bar? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=117.11999999999999s)]
*  I don't know if I'm going to be here that long. So I don't want to leave a tab open. Another person [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=124.55999999999999s)]
*  says, an Armenian, Nadeg, says, it doesn't save me anything if I keep a tab open. I swipe my card [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=130.48s)]
*  again. It's an extra 10 seconds. One other person says, it increases anxiety in me when I leave a [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=138.08s)]
*  tab open. If we want to move somewhere else, it's a lot harder to close out and then leave. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=144.4s)]
*  But bartenders argue, no, it's super annoying. Sometimes we're slammed. Having to close out [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=152.4s)]
*  after you order every drink is going to take up more time. It makes our jobs harder. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=158.48000000000002s)]
*  I hear you. I totally understand that. Customers always write. Okay, go ahead, Waz. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=163.28s)]
*  Waz? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=168.96s)]
*  I think this is just a consequence of the digital age, man. Back in the days when we were more [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=170.24s)]
*  analog, believe it or not, you just order drinks and pay when you left. No matter what, I'm telling [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=176.96s)]
*  you. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=186.4s)]
*  hold on, hold on. I don't remember this. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=188.48s)]
*  You would go to a bar. Again, this is like a classic regular bar. Before you could just [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=191.51999999999998s)]
*  with your card and everybody had a card and nobody carried cash. Everybody didn't carry cash. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=200.07999999999998s)]
*  I'm talking about back when everybody would have cash in their pocket, not everybody had a credit [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=206.32s)]
*  card. You'd order drinks at the bar and pay when you left. That's just what it was. And the bar [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=212.16s)]
*  tender would basically mentally- Trust you? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=218.48000000000002s)]
*  No, they would just be a trust you one and just mentally be like, all right, yeah, that guy got [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=220.88s)]
*  three drinks. Yeah, you owe me X, Y, and Z. That's the way it used to be. But we don't live in that [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=226.72s)]
*  time anymore. And so I'm sure the owner doesn't ever want a bartender to miss if a guy got four [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=234.32s)]
*  beers to, no, don't charge it for three. Make sure you charge it for four. And so there's that [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=241.12s)]
*  element. And people don't like to wait around and sit around. And another thing, Gen Z is broke. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=246.24s)]
*  So I don't blame them for being like- Who isn't? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=254.48000000000002s)]
*  I'm not gonna run up 200 on my card in here. So I'm getting two drinks that in New York are gonna [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=257.68s)]
*  cost $50 after tax anyway, by the way, for two cocktails. It's completely understandable [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=264.56s)]
*  on both sides, to be honest. I think the bartenders are just annoyed that [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=271.59999999999997s)]
*  their customers are just getting broker and broker as they get younger and younger. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=275.52s)]
*  I mean, maybe, I guess that's not what they're saying. They're arguing that- [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=281.12s)]
*  Nobody wants to say that they're broke, Anna. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=285.03999999999996s)]
*  But- Because they are. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=288.08s)]
*  Yeah, they are. And by the way, even if you're not broke, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=291.52s)]
*  I'm not a big fan of going to bars. I used to be just to meet up with friends, have a drink, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=295.44s)]
*  but it's become so expensive and so ridiculous. There was a restaurant near me. It wasn't a fancy [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=302.16s)]
*  restaurant. It was mid-level, but I loved it because it was a chill place, good food, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=311.76s)]
*  decently priced drinks, not too bad. They shut down and a brand new place opens up. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=316.64s)]
*  Me and my best friend decide to try it out. It's new, it's exciting. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=322.48s)]
*  $22 for a well margarita, a margarita with well liquor. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=328.0s)]
*  Unconscionable. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=334.8s)]
*  Unconscionable. I'll never go there again. I had one drink. I didn't realize what the price was [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=336.72s)]
*  until it was too late. I had ordered it already. And it's just like, I can't afford that. I can [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=341.52000000000004s)]
*  make a margarita at home for like two cents. What are we doing here? What is this? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=346.96000000000004s)]
*  There's no glass of wine that you're gonna like. Under 16 bucks, it's almost impossible to get a [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=351.76s)]
*  glass of wine in most places in LA for under 16 bucks. Yeah, cocktail at the least, they're [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=357.91999999999996s)]
*  charging you $21. You're never gonna be under $20 for a cocktail. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=365.12s)]
*  And look, I'm a strategic drinker too, to be cost effective. So there's a reason why I like [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=371.2s)]
*  vodka martinis. You only need one most of the time. If you really wanna get crazy, two max, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=377.76s)]
*  and you're done. You're gone. You're having the time of your life. Okay, you don't need more than [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=384.24s)]
*  that. But beer, I'm not gonna spend 15 bucks on a freaking beer. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=388.32s)]
*  Because I'm gonna need more than one or two to feel anything. Plus I'd rather partake in other [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=393.76s)]
*  activities like pop. You know what I mean? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=400.88s)]
*  I feel it. Yeah. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=404.8s)]
*  Yeah. So, but anyway, get together with your friends. Hit up your friend at their place. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=406.0s)]
*  Get together, have a nice dinner together, make your own cocktails. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=412.08s)]
*  Or wear something skimpy, get a dude to pay for it. That's another thing we did back in the days. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=415.36s)]
*  That's a long held tradition. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=422.15999999999997s)]
*  We bought drinks. You know what I mean? To hit on them. That was another thing we did before this [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=423.44s)]
*  Gen Z came around where we took flirting out of the equation. You can't flirt with a chick no more. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=428.88s)]
*  Yeah. Just let dudes flirt with you and buy you some. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=435.28s)]
*  You know what I mean? That's another option. I've been taking for a while, so I don't know [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=439.2s)]
*  what is and isn't allowed. But look, you're not gonna be able to see her. But I really want to [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=443.12s)]
*  hear from Kate on this if she's willing to share her perspective and then we'll wrap up. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=448.8s)]
*  Because she is Gen Z and I'm curious what she thinks. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=452.96s)]
*  I think starting a tab is insane. I would never. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=457.28s)]
*  I know, right? You just want to leave when you're ready to leave. I just. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=464.48s)]
*  And I have made that mistake of forgetting my card and then [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=469.59999999999997s)]
*  all hung over and miserable having to go back the next day. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=473.28s)]
*  It's a- Yeah, the tradition of the tab is like the guy knows you. You've got friends. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=476.15999999999997s)]
*  One of the nice things to do for a friend is buy them around and blah, blah, blah. But again, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=481.36s)]
*  at this point, especially the cool trendy places that young people want to be at, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=486.71999999999997s)]
*  you can't get your friend. If you've seen four people or three people and you get them around, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=491.04s)]
*  that's a whole week's paycheck right there. You literally, the culture is just past it. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=497.20000000000005s)]
*  In terms of financially, we don't live in that culture where you were getting $2 whiskies. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=505.44s)]
*  A shot of whiskey, some BS whiskey was two bucks. Yeah, it wasn't the best whiskey in the world, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=512.16s)]
*  but it was two bucks. Yeah. Yeah. Get your friends around six friends. Yeah, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=518.32s)]
*  just spend 12 bucks on around. Yeah. Yippee. Keep the tab running. I'm gonna get $3 beers on it. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=523.2s)]
*  That ain't the reality. No, it's not the reality. It's $20 vodka sodas. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=529.6800000000001s)]
*  The trick is to sneak liquor in in a little bottle and add it to your cocktail. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=537.36s)]
*  You know what? Guys, I've been sleeping on the flask. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOzSGbWeQSE&t=543.6s)]
