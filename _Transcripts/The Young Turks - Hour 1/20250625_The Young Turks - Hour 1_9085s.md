In a political upset, Andrew Cuomo concedes to progressive challenger Zohran Mamdani in the New York primary.

# Rep. Ro Khanna On Iranian Strikes, His Plan For SLASHING The Deficit, & Lowering Drug Costs
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow)
*  Richard [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=0.0s)]
*  Welcome to TYT, I'm your host, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=76.02s)]
*  Anna Kasparian, and we have [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=77.78s)]
*  a massive show ahead for you today. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=79.3s)]
*  In the second hour, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=81.14s)]
*  Cenk Uygur will be joining me to [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=82.42s)]
*  give us all an update on a small [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=84.44s)]
*  election that everyone seems to be [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=86.36s)]
*  talking about in New York City. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=88.44s)]
*  It's actually a huge election, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=90.88s)]
*  history has been made and [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=92.52s)]
*  we'll talk a little bit about that [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=93.82s)]
*  mayoral race, a lot of details to [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=95.69999999999999s)]
*  get into including some of the most [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=97.62s)]
*  Islamophobic disgusting reactions [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=99.74s)]
*  to that election that I've seen, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=102.08s)]
*  probably ever. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=104.16s)]
*  It's one thing to attack someone [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=105.22s)]
*  because you disagree with their [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=106.98s)]
*  policies, it's something entirely [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=108.58s)]
*  different to accuse someone of [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=110.58s)]
*  pushing Sharia law simply because [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=112.34s)]
*  they're Muslim, but [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=114.38000000000001s)]
*  there's no evidence of it whatsoever. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=115.62s)]
*  It's just incredible. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=117.9s)]
*  Again, I mean, these types of weird [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=119.46000000000001s)]
*  allegations suck the life out of [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=122.30000000000001s)]
*  every conversation, every debate [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=124.7s)]
*  that you can have about policy and [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=127.30000000000001s)]
*  it's incredibly frustrating. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=129.74s)]
*  But we'll talk about the, of [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=132.18s)]
*  course, mayoral race in New York [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=133.82s)]
*  City. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=135.66s)]
*  That'll be in a second hour, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=136.78s)]
*  Cenk wants to talk about it with [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=137.62s)]
*  me, so we're going to have to wait [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=138.86s)]
*  for that story. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=140.1s)]
*  But we've got a lot of other [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=140.7s)]
*  stories to get to, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=142.06s)]
*  including a possible financial [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=143.02s)]
*  motive, a conflict of interest, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=144.82s)]
*  that has motivated Stephen Miller [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=146.9s)]
*  to get ICE to ramp up deportations [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=149.18s)]
*  without any concern about [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=151.34s)]
*  potentially arresting and [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=153.02s)]
*  deporting the wrong people. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=154.9s)]
*  We're also going to give you some [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=156.9s)]
*  updates on Gaza. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=158.98s)]
*  Actually, I want to start off with [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=160.18s)]
*  that as the first story and [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=162.22s)]
*  some conflicting intelligence in [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=164.02s)]
*  regard to the effectiveness of [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=166.66s)]
*  the US bombing of nuclear sites in [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=169.02s)]
*  Iran. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=171.5s)]
*  I think we should be very careful [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=172.18s)]
*  with that story, but [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=173.86s)]
*  I'll give you the details as we [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=174.94s)]
*  know them today. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=176.58s)]
*  But as always, just want to [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=177.70000000000002s)]

*  All right, I wanted to start off [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=206.29999999999998s)]
*  today's show by just reacting to [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=208.54s)]
*  a clip that or [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=210.74s)]
*  a portion of Pierce Morgan show [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=211.82s)]
*  today. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=214.01999999999998s)]
*  So Pierce Morgan, as he always [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=214.74s)]
*  does, had a big panel on his show [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=218.34s)]
*  today and one of the panelists was [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=221.57999999999998s)]
*  actually an Israeli. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=223.14s)]
*  You may have heard of him, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=224.1s)]
*  his name's Gideon Levy. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=225.26s)]
*  And if you know anything about him, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=226.9s)]
*  you're probably familiar with [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=228.66s)]
*  the fact that Gideon Levy has been [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=230.1s)]
*  willing to be critical about [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=231.82s)]
*  the government of Israel or [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=233.42s)]
*  the Israeli Defense Forces and [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=234.94s)]
*  how they prosecute wars. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=236.82s)]
*  And he's really a voice that I [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=238.57999999999998s)]
*  value even though I don't always [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=240.14s)]
*  agree with him. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=241.85999999999999s)]
*  When he was on Pierce Morgan show [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=243.57999999999998s)]
*  today, I think that he may have [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=245.45999999999998s)]
*  been the first Israeli that I heard [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=247.26s)]
*  calling it his own show, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=249.34s)]
*  calling it like he sees it. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=250.86s)]
*  Telling the truth about what's [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=253.26s)]
*  actually transpiring in Gaza as it [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=255.34s)]
*  relates to those humanitarian aid [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=257.7s)]
*  hubs and the dozens, sometimes [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=260.1s)]
*  hundreds of civilians who get shot [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=262.18s)]
*  and killed by the IDF as they are [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=264.46s)]
*  waiting in line attempting to get [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=266.5s)]
*  access to flour or [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=268.66s)]
*  some humanitarian assistance. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=269.78s)]
*  So they and their families can [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=272.3s)]
*  maybe have a shot at staying alive. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=274.18s)]
*  Now with that in mind, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=276.74s)]
*  take a listen to what Gideon Levy [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=277.9s)]
*  had to say here. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=279.5s)]
*  I must remind ourselves that when [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=281.38s)]
*  the UN agencies distributed the aid, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=284.02s)]
*  there were no killed people. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=287.09999999999997s)]
*  It all started with this monster [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=289.09999999999997s)]
*  organization of putting two, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=291.9s)]
*  three stations in the Gaza Strip [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=294.61999999999995s)]
*  for 2 million people, almost as [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=297.73999999999995s)]
*  an experiment in starving human [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=300.85999999999996s)]
*  beings. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=303.9s)]
*  And then comes the question really [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=304.7s)]
*  about the figures. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=307.05999999999995s)]
*  Those propaganda people, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=308.53999999999996s)]
*  they love to speak about figures. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=310.86s)]
*  Aren't they 1000 babies less than [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=313.54s)]
*  one year killed? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=316.34s)]
*  No, they know it's only 700 babies [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=318.26s)]
*  killed, Hamas is exaggerating. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=321.1s)]
*  And if it is 700 babies killed, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=323.82s)]
*  can we live with it? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=326.42s)]
*  None of them was killed in purpose, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=328.78s)]
*  all of them by chance, all of them [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=331.34s)]
*  potential threat to the soldiers. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=333.78s)]
*  How dare you to spread this [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=336.38s)]
*  propaganda knowing that you are [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=339.1s)]
*  lying? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=341.02s)]
*  There is a daily massacre in Gaza [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=341.86s)]
*  now, killing in the sake of [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=344.54s)]
*  killing nothing but this. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=346.86s)]
*  The last two weeks are horrible [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=348.82s)]

*  you hear the machine guns, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=353.78000000000003s)]
*  you see the people lying on the [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=355.46s)]
*  sand and trying to save themselves. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=357.02s)]
*  How can you dare to invent all [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=359.42s)]
*  kinds of statistics instead of [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=361.86s)]
*  saying, yes, this is our army, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=363.74s)]
*  the army got a command now to kill [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=366.82s)]
*  as many Palestinians as possible [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=368.97999999999996s)]
*  because that's our goal now. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=371.05999999999995s)]
*  We don't have any other goal in [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=373.21999999999997s)]
*  Gaza now. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=374.5s)]
*  So that was a powerful moment on [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=377.97999999999996s)]
*  Piers Morgan show today. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=379.61999999999995s)]

*  in the center of the screen who's [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=382.61999999999995s)]
*  kind of shaking his head in denial [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=384.09999999999997s)]
*  of what Gideon Levy is saying is [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=385.65999999999997s)]
*  a former IDF spokesperson. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=387.21999999999997s)]
*  He was just rotating the usual [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=389.78s)]
*  talking points that are meant to [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=392.14s)]
*  provide cover for [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=394.58s)]
*  Israel's genocide in Gaza. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=395.97999999999996s)]
*  But Gideon Levy called it like he [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=398.14s)]
*  saw it or sees it. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=400.38s)]
*  And we also know that there are two [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=402.21999999999997s)]
*  previous Prime Ministers of Israel [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=404.3s)]
*  who at first were supportive of [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=406.58s)]
*  what was going on in Gaza. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=408.41999999999996s)]
*  But lately had no choice but to [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=410.21999999999997s)]
*  tell the truth about what's [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=412.29999999999995s)]
*  happening because everyone who's [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=414.29999999999995s)]
*  willing to be honest sees it. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=416.86s)]
*  Everyone who's paying attention [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=419.21999999999997s)]
*  sees it. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=421.02s)]
*  And the main reason why I wanted [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=422.02s)]
*  to bring that moment featuring [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=423.74s)]
*  Gideon Levy again an Israeli who [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=425.7s)]
*  lives in Israel is because [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=427.82s)]
*  oftentimes when you watch these [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=429.58s)]
*  types of debate shows, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=431.78s)]
*  the Israeli is like Jonathan [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=433.38s)]
*  Konrikis, right? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=435.46s)]
*  The other former IDF spokesperson [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=436.74s)]
*  that I pretty much lost it on when [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=439.14s)]
*  I went on Piers Morgan show on [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=441.41999999999996s)]
*  Monday of this week. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=443.62s)]
*  And it's people who seem to care [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=445.94s)]
*  very little if anything at all [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=448.3s)]
*  about the humanity of Palestinian [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=450.53999999999996s)]
*  civilians. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=453.14000000000004s)]
*  Normal people who are just trying [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=454.74s)]
*  to survive in one of the most [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=456.82000000000005s)]
*  atrocious, terrible situations you [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=458.5s)]

*  They are living through absolute [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=462.98s)]
*  hell. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=465.54s)]
*  And I think it's become very clear [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=466.62s)]
*  that the IDF's mission here is not [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=468.62s)]
*  about rooting out Hamas. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=470.58000000000004s)]
*  It's about murdering people, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=472.5s)]
*  killing people, and eventually, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=474.3s)]
*  whoever remains, displacing them. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=476.34000000000003s)]
*  One other thing that I just want to [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=478.46000000000004s)]
*  note about the IDF spokesperson who [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=479.82000000000005s)]
*  was on the show. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=481.42s)]
*  If you have time later today and [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=482.1s)]
*  you want to watch the entire [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=483.90000000000003s)]
*  episode of Piers Morgan's episode [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=485.38s)]
*  from today, you'll notice that [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=487.34000000000003s)]
*  the IDF spokesperson said that [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=489.22s)]
*  the civilian population of Gaza is [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=491.22s)]
*  1.5 million. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=493.58000000000004s)]
*  That's a little terrifying. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=497.82000000000005s)]
*  It really is because is that [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=499.46000000000004s)]
*  the civilian population? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=501.42s)]
*  How many people have actually been [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=504.26000000000005s)]
*  killed in Gaza so far? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=505.86s)]
*  Because at the beginning of this [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=507.1s)]
*  war, there were over 2 million [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=508.74s)]
*  people living in Gaza. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=510.46000000000004s)]
*  In the beginning of this war, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=512.4200000000001s)]
*  we heard that there was somewhat [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=514.0600000000001s)]
*  30,000 Hamas militants, if that. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=515.74s)]
*  So how did the IDF spokesperson [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=518.5s)]
*  reach the conclusion that there's [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=520.74s)]
*  only 1.5 million civilians living [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=523.34s)]
*  in Gaza? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=525.98s)]
*  Is it because a higher number that [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=527.0600000000001s)]
*  we don't even know about have been [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=529.22s)]
*  slaughtered by the IDF? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=531.34s)]
*  Are they just making up numbers in [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=533.3000000000001s)]
*  regard to how many Hamas militants [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=535.58s)]
*  are in Gaza? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=537.9s)]
*  What kind of intel does the Israeli [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=539.26s)]
*  military have in regard to who's [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=541.2199999999999s)]
*  a Hamas militant? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=543.02s)]
*  How do they decide whether they're [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=544.26s)]
*  going to shoot and kill someone [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=546.02s)]
*  because they suspect that they're [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=547.5s)]
*  a Hamas militant? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=549.18s)]
*  There's just a lot of weird [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=550.18s)]
*  contradictory information coming [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=552.02s)]
*  out from the IDF and [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=554.3s)]
*  the Israeli government. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=555.42s)]
*  You also have both Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=557.06s)]
*  and Donald Trump saying that [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=559.5s)]
*  there's 1.7 million Palestinians in [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=561.3399999999999s)]
*  Gaza right now. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=563.9399999999999s)]
*  When again, the death toll is [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=565.3s)]
*  allegedly only 60,000. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=567.78s)]
*  And in the beginning of this war, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=571.02s)]
*  we kept hearing that the population [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=572.8199999999999s)]
*  of Gaza was over 2 million. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=574.74s)]
*  So I don't know. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=576.18s)]
*  I think that the death toll numbers [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=577.22s)]
*  that we're getting are under [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=579.02s)]
*  counted significantly. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=580.5799999999999s)]
*  Bodies that remain buried under [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=582.46s)]
*  the rubble have not been counted in [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=584.14s)]
*  the official death toll numbers. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=586.02s)]
*  So I guess we're going to have to [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=588.06s)]
*  wait and see just how many innocent [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=589.42s)]
*  people and civilians have been [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=590.9399999999999s)]
*  slaughtered as a result of this [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=592.38s)]
*  genocide that the Israeli military [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=593.66s)]
*  has carried out in the Gaza Strip. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=595.34s)]
*  But if you pay attention to [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=597.26s)]
*  the various ministers, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=599.02s)]
*  the various government officials [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=600.38s)]
*  within the government of Israel, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=602.22s)]
*  they don't even hide it. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=603.94s)]
*  That's the thing that drives me [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=605.0600000000001s)]
*  crazy. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=606.3000000000001s)]
*  In the context of the United [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=606.82s)]

*  about how like, no, no, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=609.82s)]
*  this isn't a genocide. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=611.0600000000001s)]
*  No, they're not going to do ethnic [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=612.1800000000001s)]
*  cleansing. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=613.62s)]
*  While you have government officials [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=614.1800000000001s)]
*  flat out saying, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=616.1800000000001s)]
*  we want ethnic cleansing. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=617.22s)]

*  By the way, we're also going to [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=625.22s)]
*  take over the West Bank, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=626.78s)]

*  But they wanted that land anyway, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=632.62s)]
*  so they're going to use what [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=634.14s)]
*  happened on October 7th to just [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=635.3000000000001s)]
*  take over both territories [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=636.78s)]

*  land, stealing homes, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=656.0600000000001s)]
*  stealing homes from innocent [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=657.74s)]
*  Palestinian civilians who have [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=659.4599999999999s)]
*  the right to those homes and [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=661.3399999999999s)]
*  the right to that land. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=662.98s)]
*  But going back to Gideon Levy, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=664.5s)]
*  I know that you hear wall to wall [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=666.42s)]
*  propaganda from Israelis providing [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=668.5s)]
*  cover for the Israeli led genocide [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=671.06s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=673.4599999999999s)]
*  But I don't want you to make [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=674.98s)]
*  the mistake of thinking that every [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=676.26s)]
*  Israeli believes in what [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=677.98s)]
*  the government is doing, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=679.3s)]
*  they all love it. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=680.66s)]
*  Yes, I've seen the polling that [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=681.6999999999999s)]
*  shows that the majority of Israelis [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=683.5s)]
*  are in favor of what's happening in [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=685.7800000000001s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=687.9000000000001s)]
*  But I do question how much they [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=688.9000000000001s)]
*  really know. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=690.38s)]
*  I do question whether or not [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=691.5s)]
*  they're watching the same videos [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=692.74s)]
*  that we're watching. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=694.26s)]
*  And even so, there are also [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=695.34s)]
*  wonderful Israelis who have [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=697.3000000000001s)]
*  actually been protesting what's [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=699.1800000000001s)]
*  been going on in Gaza endlessly. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=701.38s)]
*  And they put themselves at quite [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=704.1800000000001s)]
*  a bit of risk because they become [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=705.5s)]
*  targets for [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=706.82s)]
*  the Israeli government as well. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=707.34s)]
*  So I commend Gideon Levy for [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=709.0600000000001s)]
*  speaking the truth on [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=710.9000000000001s)]
*  Piers Morgan's show. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=712.58s)]
*  This isn't the first time he's done [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=714.3399999999999s)]
*  it. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=716.02s)]
*  And I know that in our audience, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=716.52s)]
*  we do not at all try to appeal to [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=718.4599999999999s)]
*  people who have hatred in their [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=720.2199999999999s)]
*  hearts based on someone's identity. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=722.02s)]
*  But just in case, if anyone was [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=724.74s)]
*  ever under any impression that [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=727.38s)]
*  here at TYT, we support hatred [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=729.9399999999999s)]
*  toward Jewish people or [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=732.42s)]
*  toward Israeli civilians, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=734.3599999999999s)]
*  nah, I'm not about that. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=736.52s)]
*  But when it comes to systems, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=738.3s)]
*  when it comes to a government, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=740.06s)]
*  when it comes to a military, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=741.9s)]
*  we're talking about something [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=743.74s)]
*  entirely different, entirely [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=745.1s)]
*  different. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=746.74s)]
*  And so as much as some of these [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=748.02s)]
*  bad faith actors try to smear [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=750.1s)]
*  critics of the Israeli government [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=752.06s)]
*  as so-called Jew haters, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=754.54s)]
*  that is not true. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=756.38s)]
*  You have to pay close attention to [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=757.78s)]
*  the words that come out of [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=759.78s)]
*  someone's mouth. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=761.22s)]
*  If they're being specific about [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=762.82s)]
*  Israeli government policies or [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=764.82s)]
*  specific instances in which the IDF [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=766.82s)]
*  has behaved poorly, then they're [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=769.06s)]
*  obviously criticizing something [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=771.06s)]
*  that's not specific and [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=773.0200000000001s)]
*  not the identity of the individuals [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=774.4200000000001s)]
*  involved. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=776.5s)]
*  That's it. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=777.9000000000001s)]
*  So thank you to Gideon Levy. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=778.82s)]
*  It's about time we heard someone [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=780.7s)]
*  who's Israeli go on Piers Morgan [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=782.3800000000001s)]
*  and actually tell the truth about [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=784.0600000000001s)]
*  what's going on. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=785.82s)]
*  All right, with that said, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=787.9000000000001s)]
*  I want to talk a little bit about [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=789.3800000000001s)]
*  a really interesting leak that [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=791.1400000000001s)]
*  came out. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=792.86s)]
*  And I think we should proceed with [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=793.58s)]
*  caution whenever there's leaked [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=795.9000000000001s)]
*  intel in regard to Iran, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=798.1400000000001s)]
*  in regard to conflicts in [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=799.98s)]
*  the Middle East, especially when a [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=801.78s)]
*  lot of this intel in the past has [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=803.86s)]
*  gotten us into a lot of trouble. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=805.7s)]
*  Now with that in mind, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=807.58s)]
*  let's get to the story. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=808.58s)]
*  The conversion facility, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=809.7s)]
*  which you can't do a nuclear [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=810.98s)]
*  weapon without a conversion [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=812.26s)]
*  facility, we can't even find where [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=813.62s)]
*  it is, where it used to be on [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=815.34s)]
*  the map. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=816.54s)]
*  You can't even find where it used [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=817.42s)]
*  to be because the whole thing is [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=818.7s)]
*  just blackened out, it's gone. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=819.94s)]
*  It's wiped out. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=820.9s)]
*  It's wiped out. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=821.54s)]
*  Then we dropped 12 of the strongest [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=822.22s)]
*  bombs on the planet right down [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=824.1s)]
*  the hole in two places. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=825.78s)]
*  Everything underneath that [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=827.34s)]
*  mountain is in bad shape. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=828.58s)]
*  When you talk to the people who [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=829.7s)]
*  built the bombs, understand what [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=831.26s)]
*  those bombs can do and [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=833.02s)]
*  deliver those bombs, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=834.26s)]
*  they landed precisely where they [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=835.46s)]
*  were supposed to, so [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=837.1s)]
*  it's a flawless mission. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=838.0600000000001s)]
*  Flawless. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=839.34s)]
*  You would think they'd do [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=840.5400000000001s)]
*  the opposite. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=841.26s)]
*  You would think they'd want to say [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=842.14s)]
*  this was an unbelievable success. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=843.78s)]
*  And the thing that hurts me is [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=845.94s)]
*  it's really demeaning to the [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=847.14s)]
*  pilots and the people that put that [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=848.34s)]
*  whole thing together, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=849.86s)]
*  the generals. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=850.9s)]
*  That was a perfect operation. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=852.4200000000001s)]
*  Moderate to severe and we believe [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=854.1800000000001s)]
*  far more likely severe and [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=856.4200000000001s)]
*  obliterated. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=858.1800000000001s)]
*  So this is a political motive here. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=859.14s)]
*  The Trump administration found [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=861.22s)]
*  itself defending the effectiveness [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=863.5s)]
*  of their bombing campaign against [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=866.0600000000001s)]
*  nuclear sites in Iran today, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=868.46s)]
*  following a leak from the Pentagon's [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=870.62s)]
*  Defense Intelligence Agency, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=873.26s)]
*  which claims that the operation set [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=875.62s)]
*  back the Iranian government by just [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=878.14s)]
*  a few months, that it just wasn't [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=880.7s)]
*  as effective as previously thought. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=883.14s)]
*  Now, I actually side with [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=885.82s)]
*  the administration officials here, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=887.6600000000001s)]

*  report that was leaked by [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=893.38s)]
*  a Pentagon staffer should be looked [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=895.1800000000001s)]

*  skepticism. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=899.46s)]
*  But with that in mind, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=900.58s)]
*  let's hear more about what this [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=901.94s)]
*  leaked intel indicated. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=903.74s)]
*  Based on a battle damage [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=906.46s)]

*  looking at what was actually [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=912.26s)]
*  damaged, the Defense Intelligence [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=913.74s)]
*  Agency has assessed that the core [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=915.6600000000001s)]
*  components of Iran's nuclear [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=917.6600000000001s)]
*  program are largely intact and [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=919.42s)]
*  that Iran's nuclear program has [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=922.02s)]
*  essentially only been set back by [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=923.42s)]
*  months. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=925.42s)]
*  Now, we presented this information [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=926.2199999999999s)]

*  She did acknowledge the existence [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=931.78s)]

*  in a statement that the [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=935.3s)]

*  Now again, this preliminary report [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=950.02s)]
*  was leaked to CNN and [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=952.1s)]
*  also to the New York Times. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=953.18s)]
*  And this report that was done by [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=955.06s)]
*  the Defense Intelligence Agency [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=956.86s)]

*  New York Times, on the state of [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=961.18s)]
*  the Fordo plant. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=963.1s)]
*  And that's the country's deeply [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=964.38s)]
*  buried uranium enrichment [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=966.62s)]
*  facility, which produced the near [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=968.62s)]
*  bomb grade level enriched uranium. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=971.14s)]
*  If you guys can remember when we [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=974.18s)]
*  originally covered this story, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=975.86s)]
*  Iran had managed to enrich uranium [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=977.7800000000001s)]
*  to 60%, you need to get it to 90% [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=979.98s)]
*  enrichment in order for it to be [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=982.2600000000001s)]
*  at the level necessary to build [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=984.4200000000001s)]
*  an atomic bomb or a nuclear weapon. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=986.6600000000001s)]
*  But nonetheless, officials familiar [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=988.98s)]
*  with the intelligence report said [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=991.2600000000001s)]
*  that early findings, again, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=993.5s)]
*  early findings, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=995.4200000000001s)]
*  no one's been on the ground yet. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=996.5400000000001s)]
*  So really, in order to know [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=998.82s)]
*  the extent of the damage to these [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1000.5s)]
*  nuclear facilities, we have to [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1002.5s)]
*  see what happens after an [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1004.94s)]
*  international group goes to inspect [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1006.7s)]
*  the sites and determine just how [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1009.38s)]
*  bad the damage is. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1011.74s)]
*  But nonetheless, officials familiar [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1013.0600000000001s)]
*  with the intelligence report said [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1015.02s)]
*  that early findings showed that [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1016.82s)]
*  the strikes had set back Iran's [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1018.62s)]
*  nuclear program by months. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1020.42s)]
*  Officials said the strikes sealed [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1022.14s)]
*  off entrances to the facility, but [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1024.22s)]
*  had not led to a collapse, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1026.34s)]
*  leaving open the possibility that [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1027.94s)]
*  Iran could eventually dig it out. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1030.02s)]
*  So let's just pause for a second. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1032.22s)]
*  Really, 30,000 pound bombs didn't [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1034.9399999999998s)]
*  cause any damage to the facility? [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1038.2199999999998s)]
*  What are we talking about here? [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1042.06s)]
*  I remember prior to the Trump [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1044.1s)]
*  administration making the decision [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1045.8999999999999s)]
*  to drop the bombs, there was all [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1048.1399999999999s)]
*  this analysis done about whether or [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1050.02s)]
*  not the bombs would even be [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1052.06s)]
*  effective. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1053.4599999999998s)]
*  And the bombs had recently been [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1054.4199999999998s)]
*  upgraded or updated in order to be [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1056.7399999999998s)]
*  effective for the Fordo facility [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1059.2199999999998s)]
*  because of how deeply buried that [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1061.82s)]
*  facility was. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1064.34s)]
*  Now let me give you some more of [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1065.3799999999999s)]
*  the intel as it pertains to this [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1067.26s)]
*  preliminary report. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1069.22s)]
*  The reason Iran most likely could [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1070.98s)]
*  still race to a bomb relatively [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1072.86s)]
*  quickly, officials said, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1074.62s)]
*  is that Iran likely retains much of [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1076.1s)]
*  the enriched uranium and [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1078.26s)]
*  likely has secret nuclear [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1079.86s)]
*  facilities in which to process it [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1081.6599999999999s)]
*  further. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1084.02s)]
*  Now likely doesn't tell me [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1085.58s)]
*  anything. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1087.4199999999998s)]
*  Obviously there's a lack of [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1089.06s)]
*  certainty here. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1090.5s)]
*  Are there other facilities? [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1091.6599999999999s)]
*  How is it that we know about some [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1092.78s)]
*  of these facilities and we don't [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1094.14s)]
*  know about the other alleged [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1095.5400000000002s)]
*  facilities that might exist? [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1096.7800000000002s)]
*  The other thing that's really [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1098.46s)]
*  interesting to me here is, look, [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1100.26s)]
*  there is definitely some indication [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1102.42s)]
*  that they did take the enriched 60% [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1105.0600000000002s)]
*  enriched uranium out of these [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1107.66s)]
*  facilities in order to put it in [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1109.8200000000002s)]
*  a safe place where they knew these [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1112.0200000000002s)]
*  bombs would not damage them or [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1114.6200000000001s)]
*  be impacted by them. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1116.8600000000001s)]
*  There's been some reporting on [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1119.1000000000001s)]
*  that that seems credible. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1120.5s)]
*  However, I don't know for sure yet [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1121.94s)]
*  and no one knows for sure yet and [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1124.06s)]
*  that's really important to [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1126.02s)]
*  harp on here. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1127.6399999999999s)]
*  But let's also talk about where [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1128.46s)]
*  Iran was in their alleged quest to [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1130.58s)]
*  build a nuclear weapon prior to [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1132.82s)]
*  the bombings. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1135.1s)]
*  So again, you need 90% enriched [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1136.74s)]
*  uranium in order to build the bombs. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1138.8999999999999s)]
*  They had enriched uranium up to 60%. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1141.6599999999999s)]
*  They do not have or [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1144.86s)]
*  there is no indication and [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1146.3s)]
*  there was no intelligence to [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1148.5s)]
*  indicate that Iran had restarted [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1150.98s)]
*  the nuclear weapons program that [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1154.1799999999998s)]
*  they had suspended all the way back [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1156.9399999999998s)]
*  in 2003. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1159.9799999999998s)]
*  And that was the intel that was [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1161.4599999999998s)]
*  shared by Tulsi Gabbard, head of [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1163.26s)]
*  the DNI Director of National [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1165.3s)]
*  Intelligence. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1167.1s)]
*  So there was no indication that [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1168.3799999999999s)]
*  they had started building a weapon [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1170.1s)]
*  or that they had restarted their [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1172.02s)]
*  nuclear weapons program that was [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1173.78s)]
*  suspended back in 2003. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1175.58s)]
*  The other thing is, it's one thing [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1177.1s)]
*  to build a nuclear weapon. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1179.06s)]
*  You also need to have a mechanism [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1180.58s)]
*  in which you would deliver said [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1182.62s)]
*  nuclear weapon. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1184.54s)]
*  They don't have that type of [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1185.7399999999998s)]
*  mechanism. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1186.78s)]
*  There's no indication they've [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1187.3s)]
*  worked on that type of mechanism. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1188.6999999999998s)]
*  They were nowhere close to building [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1190.3s)]
*  a nuclear bomb before these [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1193.1399999999999s)]
*  bombings took place. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1195.3s)]
*  Now if you think 30,000 pound bombs [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1197.4599999999998s)]
*  didn't do damage to these [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1199.4599999999998s)]
*  facilities, especially after you [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1200.8999999999999s)]
*  see satellite imagery showing you [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1203.02s)]
*  the damage, you're falling for [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1205.06s)]
*  pro-war propaganda, if you ask me. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1206.8999999999999s)]
*  That's my belief. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1209.26s)]
*  I also think usually when a staffer [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1210.98s)]
*  at the Pentagon leaks preliminary [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1213.9s)]
*  intel, there's the motive behind [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1216.8600000000001s)]
*  it. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1219.46s)]
*  You really have to ask yourself, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1219.98s)]
*  what is the motive here? [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1221.66s)]
*  Because remember, as we know, [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1222.94s)]
*  this war in Iran, the war that [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1225.02s)]
*  Israel was trying to go the United [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1226.98s)]
*  States into, really didn't have [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1229.1000000000001s)]
*  anything to do with nuclear weapons. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1231.18s)]
*  The narrative switched to regime [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1233.94s)]
*  change war real quick. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1235.9s)]
*  And as we also know, Prime Minister [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1237.94s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1239.94s)]
*  been warning about Iran obtaining [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1242.02s)]
*  a nuclear weapon in weeks until he [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1244.22s)]
*  was interviewed by Brett Baier last [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1246.5s)]
*  week and admitted that building [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1248.8200000000002s)]
*  a nuclear weapon was maybe a year [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1250.9s)]
*  to three years away. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1253.02s)]
*  Okay, look, I don't think it was [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1256.42s)]
*  about the nuclear weapon. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1258.38s)]
*  That's why we kept hearing about [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1260.26s)]
*  a regime change war. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1262.02s)]
*  And now it appears that a regime [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1263.3000000000002s)]
*  change war is not on the horizon. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1265.1000000000001s)]
*  And whoa, suddenly there's [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1267.26s)]
*  preliminary intel being leaked [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1268.8999999999999s)]
*  from the Pentagon, the same federal [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1270.9799999999998s)]
*  government entity that can't pass [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1273.62s)]
*  a single audit. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1276.1399999999999s)]
*  Okay, the government entity that [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1277.62s)]
*  hasn't seen a war doesn't love. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1279.58s)]
*  So just something to keep in mind. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1281.86s)]
*  Now Israel produced their own [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1283.1s)]
*  intelligence, and I'll do it with [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1284.78s)]
*  scare quotes, intelligence that of [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1286.82s)]
*  course mirrors this preliminary [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1289.1s)]
*  report that was leaked to CNN and [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1291.1799999999998s)]
*  the New York Times. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1293.3s)]
*  I think it should be ignored. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1295.54s)]
*  They have a serious conflict of [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1296.82s)]
*  interest here. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1298.54s)]
*  Obviously they want to go to war [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1299.22s)]
*  with Iran specifically to change [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1301.06s)]
*  the regime there. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1302.86s)]
*  They want the Ayatollah gone, [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1303.86s)]
*  either by assassination or [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1306.46s)]
*  other means. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1308.86s)]
*  And they want to essentially [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1309.98s)]
*  install the son of the Shah that [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1312.26s)]
*  was exiled from Iran during [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1314.78s)]
*  the revolution in the late 1970s. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1316.86s)]
*  So luckily though, and I honestly [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1320.18s)]
*  didn't think I was going to say [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1322.26s)]
*  this, but luckily Trump rejected [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1324.22s)]
*  Israel's intel as well. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1326.46s)]
*  And you're about to hear him do [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1328.18s)]
*  that right now. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1329.42s)]
*  I think- [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1331.3400000000001s)]
*  You should really say how great [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1331.8600000000001s)]
*  our soldiers and our warriors are. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1333.78s)]
*  I think everyone appreciates our [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1335.78s)]
*  soldiers and our warriors. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1336.9s)]
*  I do have two questions for you, [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1337.98s)]
*  Mr. President. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1339.42s)]
*  You just cited Israeli intelligence [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1340.0600000000002s)]
*  on these attacks. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1342.74s)]
*  Earlier you said US intelligence [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1344.1000000000001s)]
*  was inconclusive. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1345.98s)]
*  Are you relying on Israeli [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1347.22s)]
*  intelligence for [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1348.66s)]
*  your assessment of the impact [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1349.5800000000002s)]
*  of the strikes? [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1351.02s)]
*  No, this is also Iran made [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1352.0600000000002s)]
*  the statement. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1353.54s)]
*  And it's also if you read [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1354.6200000000001s)]
*  the document that was given that [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1356.0600000000002s)]
*  Pete can talk about if you'd like. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1357.98s)]
*  The document said it could be very [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1360.1s)]
*  severe damage, but [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1362.14s)]
*  they didn't take that. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1363.3s)]
*  They said it could be limited or [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1365.22s)]
*  it could be very severe. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1366.58s)]
*  They really didn't know other than [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1367.7s)]
*  to say it could be limited or [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1369.42s)]
*  it could be very, very severe. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1371.02s)]
*  And you didn't choose to put that [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1373.38s)]
*  because it was very early after. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1375.14s)]
*  Since then, we've collected [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1376.9s)]
*  additional intelligence. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1378.46s)]
*  We've also spoken to people who [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1379.8600000000001s)]
*  have seen the site and [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1381.66s)]
*  the site is obliterated. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1382.9s)]
*  And we think everything nuclear is [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1385.6200000000001s)]
*  down there, they didn't take it [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1387.54s)]
*  out. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1389.1s)]
*  Okay, so everything Trump said [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1390.6599999999999s)]
*  there was actually true except for [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1392.34s)]
*  that very last sentence. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1394.06s)]
*  And I want to be honest and [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1395.78s)]
*  accurate with you guys, right? [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1397.02s)]
*  So again, there is some indication [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1398.62s)]
*  that the Iranians had moved [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1401.8999999999999s)]
*  the enriched uranium. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1404.18s)]
*  We don't know for sure yet. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1405.3799999999999s)]
*  I'm not saying that as if it is [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1406.8999999999999s)]
*  definitely true. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1408.6599999999999s)]
*  But what he was saying earlier [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1409.86s)]
*  about the preliminary report and [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1411.98s)]
*  how the media seems to avoid [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1414.3799999999999s)]
*  harping on the entirety of [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1416.74s)]
*  the statement. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1418.46s)]
*  Meaning the damage could be limited [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1419.3400000000001s)]
*  or it could be extensive. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1421.0200000000002s)]
*  They tend to leave the extensive [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1422.3000000000002s)]
*  part out of the preliminary report, [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1423.7s)]
*  which I think is hilarious. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1425.3000000000002s)]
*  And kind of tells you, [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1426.66s)]
*  there seems to be this orchestrated [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1428.1000000000001s)]
*  effort to continue goading [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1430.3000000000002s)]
*  the Trump administration into [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1431.98s)]
*  a war with Iran. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1433.8600000000001s)]
*  Which I think would be a disastrous [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1434.98s)]
*  situation for the Middle East, [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1437.18s)]
*  of course. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1439.3400000000001s)]
*  And it would be disastrous for [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1440.2600000000002s)]
*  our own country when we should be [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1441.8600000000001s)]
*  focused on other things. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1443.5800000000002s)]

*  Rubio, who tried to pour cold [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1450.18s)]

*  Meaning a facility to convert [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1459.18s)]
*  uranium to enriched uranium. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1461.38s)]

*  where it used to be on the map. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1465.42s)]
*  The whole thing is blackened out. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1467.18s)]

*  But there's also some dissent that [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1472.0600000000002s)]
*  isn't really being talked about at [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1474.02s)]
*  all within the defense and [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1476.22s)]

*  were. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1482.8600000000001s)]
*  So more importantly, [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1484.74s)]
*  the intel that was leaked was [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1485.9s)]
*  preliminary. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1487.3s)]
*  I know I keep repeating that, but [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1488.1000000000001s)]
*  I want to really harp on it. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1489.8600000000001s)]
*  And we should be asking why [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1491.22s)]

*  They haven't finished [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1500.8600000000001s)]
*  their investigation. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1501.66s)]
*  So the person who leaked this, [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1502.54s)]
*  why did they leak it? [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1504.54s)]
*  What is their motivation? [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1506.06s)]
*  The analysis of the damage to [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1507.54s)]

*  the strikes on Iran's nuclear [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1511.06s)]
*  ambitions is ongoing and [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1513.18s)]
*  could change as more intelligence [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1514.94s)]
*  becomes available. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1517.22s)]
*  Plus, international inspectors and [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1519.78s)]
*  nuclear experts agree that [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1522.18s)]

*  a key bottleneck in the weapons [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1527.98s)]

*  years. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1534.54s)]
*  So I hate being in a position where [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1535.54s)]
*  I have to give someone like Marco [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1537.78s)]

*  what Marco Rubio said there in [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1541.8600000000001s)]
*  the quote that I read earlier is [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1543.8600000000001s)]
*  true. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1545.94s)]

*  severely damaged. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1550.58s)]
*  Again, that same report noted that [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1552.42s)]
*  the conversion facility was [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1554.66s)]
*  severely damaged. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1556.5s)]
*  They concluded it will be a long [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1557.9s)]
*  time before Iran comes anywhere [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1559.94s)]
*  the capability it had before [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1562.42s)]
*  the attack. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1564.3799999999999s)]
*  Now, for those who want to believe [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1565.98s)]
*  some preliminary leaked intel from [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1568.7s)]
*  some motivated staffer with [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1571.34s)]
*  an agenda over at the Pentagon, [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1573.46s)]
*  I guess have at it. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1575.74s)]
*  Seems like you probably want to go [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1577.7s)]
*  to war with Iran, even if it's not [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1579.34s)]
*  in the best interest of anyone, [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1580.98s)]
*  including by the way Israel. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1582.5s)]
*  This idea that it's going to go [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1584.58s)]
*  well for Israel is hilarious. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1585.9s)]
*  It didn't go so well when it comes [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1587.3s)]
*  to Iraq, did it? [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1588.86s)]
*  But nonetheless, [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1589.82s)]
*  most Scarborough of all people had [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1591.22s)]
*  a warning, and I think it's worth [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1593.3s)]
*  listening to take a look. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1595.5s)]
*  We also have to be cautious about [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1597.46s)]
*  being played by people inside [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1599.74s)]
*  the intel community who want to get [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1601.78s)]

*  months later and said, well, [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1623.22s)]
*  actually they just had a low degree [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1624.74s)]
*  of confidence of that. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1626.5s)]
*  That's happened an awful lot. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1627.74s)]
*  This story, I mean, save it, [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1632.86s)]

*  mirrors the leak because war is [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=1699.7s)]

*  at Harvard that we were initially [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2117.46s)]
*  going to share with you, but [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2119.22s)]
*  we didn't feel good about the [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2120.66s)]
*  numbers. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2122.1s)]
*  We didn't feel confident enough to [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2122.66s)]
*  share that with you. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2124.42s)]
*  So we're going to wait to make sure [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2125.74s)]

*  But those are issues that should be [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2207.5s)]

*  I mean, as you all know, [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2233.18s)]
*  that bombing happened of those [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2234.8199999999997s)]
*  Iranian nuclear facilities without [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2236.7s)]

*  Congress didn't approve it, so [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2240.18s)]
*  there was no debate. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2242.04s)]
*  But more importantly, [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2243.62s)]
*  we were all surprised by it because [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2244.5s)]
*  it was announced after it was [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2245.8599999999997s)]

*  never a debate. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2253.66s)]

*  in the case of defense spending, [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2255.5s)]
*  close to a trillion dollars a year [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2257.02s)]
*  at this point. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2258.4599999999996s)]
*  Obviously, you have to be able to [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2259.22s)]
*  balance a budget. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2261.34s)]

*  And now reporting indicates that [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2363.06s)]
*  based on his financial disclosures, [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2365.3s)]

*  So as we all know, and [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2378.1s)]
*  thanks to the Wall Street Journal [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2379.3399999999997s)]

*  this, these ICE raids have really [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2383.42s)]
*  ramped up beginning in early June. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2385.5s)]
*  And part of the reason why is [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2387.58s)]
*  because Stephen Miller specifically [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2389.18s)]
*  told ICE, listen, you guys are not [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2391.3799999999997s)]
*  meeting the numbers that we want. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2393.42s)]
*  So we want you to go for [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2395.94s)]
*  the long hanging fruit. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2396.98s)]
*  We want you to go to Home Depot [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2397.98s)]
*  parking lots, find the day laborers. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2399.74s)]
*  They tend to be undocumented, [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2402.46s)]
*  round them up, arrest them. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2403.98s)]
*  We're going to deport them. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2405.66s)]
*  We want to increase our numbers. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2406.66s)]
*  Well now it turns out that it might [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2408.58s)]
*  not just be about Trump wanting to [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2410.8199999999997s)]
*  beat Obama's deportation numbers. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2413.1s)]
*  Obama, the deporter in chief as he [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2416.06s)]
*  was called. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2418.18s)]
*  And to be fair, Trump is definitely [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2419.2999999999997s)]
*  very competitive and wants to beat [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2421.5s)]
*  Obama's numbers. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2423.58s)]
*  I don't deny that at all. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2425.1s)]
*  But for Stephen Miller, [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2426.74s)]
*  there's something personal and [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2427.94s)]
*  financial involved as well. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2429.54s)]
*  And that has to do with his [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2431.22s)]
*  investment in Palantir, which is [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2432.7799999999997s)]
*  very, very much involved in our [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2435.18s)]
*  deportation schemes here in [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2437.2999999999997s)]
*  the United States. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2439.22s)]
*  So according to ethics disclosure [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2440.74s)]
*  reports released by the White [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2443.22s)]
*  House, Miller owns between $100,000 [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2445.46s)]
*  and $250,000 worth of stock in [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2448.74s)]
*  Palantir, which of course is Peter [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2451.2999999999997s)]
*  Teal's data and intelligence [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2453.9s)]
*  software company that has several [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2456.1s)]
*  lucrative contracts with immigration [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2458.5s)]
*  and customs enforcement to track [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2461.18s)]
*  violence on undocumented immigrants [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2463.66s)]
*  and soon American citizens. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2466.22s)]
*  We've covered that. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2468.42s)]
*  We'll continue covering that as [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2469.7s)]
*  that story develops. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2471.18s)]
*  But nonetheless, Miller isn't [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2472.2999999999997s)]
*  the only one in the Trump [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2474.3399999999997s)]
*  administration with investments or [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2475.9s)]
*  stock in the company. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2478.2599999999998s)]
*  But he does have the largest stake. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2480.54s)]
*  Miller's investment could pose [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2482.7799999999997s)]
*  a severe conflict of interest, [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2484.74s)]
*  obviously, especially since [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2486.7s)]
*  Palantir has had close ties to ICE. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2488.62s)]
*  By the way, dating is far back [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2491.2599999999998s)]
*  as the Obama administration. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2493.98s)]
*  And I'm not doing this both sides [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2495.94s)]
*  thing, but we also have to be real [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2497.82s)]
*  about the Democrats. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2499.78s)]
*  Because the Democrats, [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2500.86s)]
*  they're different from the Trump [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2502.42s)]
*  administration in that they don't [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2504.42s)]
*  make a big show of the deportations [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2506.5s)]
*  that they engage in. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2508.6600000000003s)]
*  But I went back and read stories [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2510.1400000000003s)]
*  from the Obama administration about [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2512.34s)]
*  how he had no problem separating [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2515.06s)]
*  families. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2517.34s)]
*  If the children were born here in [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2519.1s)]
*  the US, they could stay here, [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2520.94s)]
*  because obviously they're citizens. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2522.62s)]
*  But he would deport the parents all [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2525.02s)]
*  the time. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2526.7s)]
*  And it's amazing to me that the [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2527.5s)]
*  same Democrats who obviously are [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2529.42s)]
*  pointing to the cruelty that we're [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2531.5s)]
*  seeing on the streets right now [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2533.62s)]
*  with these ICE raids, [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2535.46s)]
*  they totally gave Obama a pass. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2536.7s)]
*  They didn't freak out about what [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2538.2999999999997s)]
*  Obama was doing. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2539.7799999999997s)]
*  So we need to hold government [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2540.7s)]
*  officials, politicians, [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2542.62s)]
*  presidents accountable regardless [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2544.44s)]
*  of their party. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2546.86s)]
*  Otherwise, you're just [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2547.74s)]
*  a hypocritical person, okay? [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2549.62s)]
*  Now with that in mind, [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2552.8199999999997s)]
*  let me give you some more on what [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2554.18s)]
*  we've learned about Stephen Miller's [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2556.02s)]
*  financial disclosures. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2558.2999999999997s)]
*  So Palantir, I should note, [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2559.7799999999997s)]
*  received a $41 million government [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2561.84s)]
*  contract back in 2014. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2564.34s)]
*  This is during the Obama [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2566.62s)]
*  administration and created custom [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2568.2599999999998s)]
*  software for ICE, referred to as [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2570.98s)]
*  investigative case management. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2573.58s)]
*  Now deportations have escalated [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2576.7s)]
*  pretty quickly following Miller's [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2578.7799999999997s)]
*  directive to ICE officials in early [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2581.1s)]
*  June, but months earlier in April, [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2583.38s)]
*  this is super important. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2585.78s)]
*  So just months earlier, [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2587.5s)]
*  ICE awarded Palantir another $30 [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2589.42s)]
*  million contract to create tracking [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2592.3s)]
*  software aimed at providing [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2595.22s)]
*  the agency with near real time [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2597.3s)]
*  visibility into migrants engaging [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2599.5s)]
*  in self deportation. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2602.14s)]
*  According to documents obtained by [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2604.3s)]
*  Wired, one of the core functions of [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2606.58s)]
*  the program dubbed Immigration OS, [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2609.02s)]
*  very creative, would be to [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2611.58s)]
*  streamline and prioritize selection [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2613.42s)]
*  and apprehension operations of [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2616.18s)]
*  illegal aliens, and [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2618.58s)]
*  I'm reading that verbatim. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2619.94s)]
*  So Reuters reports that this is [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2621.62s)]
*  the largest single federal contract [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2623.7s)]
*  that Palantir has been able to [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2626.3s)]
*  secure from a federal government [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2628.38s)]
*  agency, in this case ICE. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2630.78s)]
*  And Don Fox, who's the former [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2632.7400000000002s)]
*  acting head and former general [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2634.82s)]
*  counsel of the Office of Government [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=2636.94s)]

*  if I'm not mistaken. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3203.84s)]
*  Anyway, she was on a panel and [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3205.84s)]
*  she said Kamala Harris's name [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3207.64s)]
*  incorrectly. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3209.44s)]
*  Now the accusation was that she was [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3210.48s)]

*  Kamala. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3221.16s)]
*  And it's not because they're bad [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3222.7200000000003s)]
*  people or they're intentionally [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3224.56s)]
*  trying to mispronounce her name or [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3226.36s)]
*  they're racist, [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3228.12s)]
*  it's a different name, [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3229.12s)]
*  it's a unique name. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3230.52s)]
*  Seeing how Nancy Mays has been [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3231.72s)]

*  months, I've changed my mind. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3235.2s)]
*  I think she did it intentionally. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3236.96s)]
*  I think she got a rise out of it and [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3238.84s)]
*  it was gross. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3240.2799999999997s)]
*  So for everyone who disagreed with [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3241.08s)]
*  me, I've now changed my mind. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3242.88s)]

*  There's more to get to when it [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3248.04s)]

*  who's now coming out and [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3306.4s)]
*  sharing that Trump's own justice [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3308.0400000000004s)]

*  the allegation that they were [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3315.84s)]

*  I'm not kidding. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3319.96s)]
*  So let me give you all the details [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3321.84s)]
*  on this. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3323.44s)]
*  So again, this is a whistleblower [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3323.96s)]
*  at Trump's own justice department [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3325.76s)]

*  The whistleblower's name is [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3329.2400000000002s)]
*  Erez Rouveni. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3331.28s)]
*  Now he is the Trump administration [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3332.52s)]
*  lawyer specifically who admitted [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3335.2400000000002s)]
*  that Kilmar Abrego Garcia was [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3338.04s)]
*  deported mistakenly. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3340.68s)]
*  Now according to Rouveni, [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3342.8399999999997s)]
*  Principal Associate Deputy Attorney [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3344.7s)]

*  administration's deportations [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3349.7599999999998s)]

*  of any court orders preventing [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3354.44s)]
*  them. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3356.68s)]
*  That's a pretty big revelation. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3359.56s)]
*  And I'm not okay with that. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3362.16s)]
*  We have a system of checks and [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3364.48s)]
*  balances. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3366.3599999999997s)]
*  Even if the executive branch [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3368.08s)]
*  doesn't like a ruling from [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3369.72s)]
*  our judicial branch, [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3371.6s)]
*  if you believe in our constitution, [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3373.9599999999996s)]
*  if you believe in our system of [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3375.3999999999996s)]
*  government, you must abide by that [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3376.56s)]
*  decision or appeal it and [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3378.48s)]
*  go through the process. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3380.0s)]
*  But according to Rouveni, [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3381.8799999999997s)]
*  that is not what the direction was. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3383.9599999999996s)]
*  So in March, Bove allegedly stated [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3386.7999999999997s)]
*  in a meeting that the Trump [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3388.8799999999997s)]
*  administration was about to carry [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3390.48s)]
*  out deportations under the Alien [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3392.56s)]
*  Enemies Act. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3394.64s)]
*  Bove indicated these removals were [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3395.64s)]
*  a priority for the administration [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3397.96s)]
*  and stressed to all in attendance [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3400.4s)]
*  that the planes needed to take off [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3402.92s)]
*  no matter what. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3405.48s)]
*  And indeed, we had shared a story [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3406.76s)]
*  with you indicating that after [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3409.32s)]
*  a federal judge had told the Trump [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3411.56s)]
*  administration that they are not to [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3413.88s)]
*  send a flight of immigrants to [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3416.48s)]
*  El Salvador, they did it anyway. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3418.84s)]
*  They're too late, [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3421.48s)]
*  they're in midair, sorry. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3422.6800000000003s)]
*  So just totally ignoring what our [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3425.3599999999997s)]
*  judicial branch is ordering the [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3427.7599999999998s)]
*  executive branch to do in that [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3430.2799999999997s)]
*  case. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3432.56s)]
*  Now, and if a court order were to [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3434.08s)]
*  try and stop the deportations, [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3436.48s)]
*  Bove stated that the DOJ would need [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3438.9199999999996s)]
*  to consider telling the courts FU [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3441.72s)]
*  and ignore any such court order. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3444.6s)]
*  Now Rouveni also stated that he [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3447.96s)]
*  was instructed by the Trump [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3450.04s)]
*  administration to refer to kill [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3451.7999999999997s)]
*  Marabrego Garcia as a terrorist. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3453.84s)]
*  But he refused to do so because he [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3456.0s)]
*  was not aware of any evidence [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3458.2400000000002s)]
*  indicating that Abrego Garcia was [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3460.2400000000002s)]
*  a terrorist. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3462.6400000000003s)]
*  There was nothing to back up that [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3463.52s)]
*  claim, so he refused to do it. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3465.5600000000004s)]
*  Now the Trump administration denies [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3467.52s)]
*  Rouveni's allegations. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3469.84s)]
*  But interestingly enough, [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3471.48s)]
*  Bove was at a House hearing today [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3473.32s)]
*  and you're about to watch Senator [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3475.52s)]
*  Adam Schiff ask some important [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3477.88s)]
*  questions. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3480.0s)]
*  Let's see what both had to say. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3480.8s)]
*  Senator, I have no recollection of [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3482.4s)]
*  saying anything of that kind. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3484.36s)]
*  To the extent I usually- [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3486.04s)]
*  What did you recall, Mr. Bove, [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3487.28s)]
*  if you said or suggested during [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3489.0s)]
*  a meeting with Justice Department [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3490.6800000000003s)]
*  lawyers that maybe they should [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3492.56s)]
*  consider telling the court? [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3494.12s)]
*  It seems to me that would be [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3495.56s)]
*  something you'd remember unless [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3496.96s)]
*  that's the kind of thing you say [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3498.44s)]
*  frequently. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3500.0s)]
*  Well, I've certainly said things [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3500.56s)]
*  encouraging litigators at [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3503.0s)]
*  the department to fight hard for [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3504.84s)]
*  valid positions that we have to [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3507.0s)]
*  take in defense of our clients. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3508.84s)]
*  And if you frequently suggest [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3510.64s)]
*  that they say you and [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3512.12s)]
*  ignore court orders, [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3513.08s)]
*  is that also something you [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3514.2799999999997s)]
*  frequently do such you might not [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3515.68s)]
*  remember doing it on this occasion? [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3517.4s)]
*  No, and as I explained, [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3519.4s)]
*  I have never directed- [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3520.84s)]
*  So did you or did you not make [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3522.08s)]
*  those comments during that meeting? [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3523.6s)]
*  Which comment, Senator? [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3525.48s)]
*  You really need me to repeat it? [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3528.08s)]
*  Did you suggest, [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3530.2799999999997s)]
*  as Mr. Rouveni wrote, that DOJ [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3531.48s)]
*  would need to consider telling the [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3533.72s)]
*  courts you and ignore any such [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3536.04s)]
*  court order? [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3537.88s)]
*  I did not suggest that there was [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3538.7999999999997s)]
*  any need to consider ignoring court [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3540.96s)]
*  orders at the point of that meeting. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3543.32s)]
*  There were no court orders to [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3545.96s)]
*  discuss. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3547.6800000000003s)]
*  Well, did you suggest telling [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3548.2400000000002s)]
*  the courts you in any manner? [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3550.2000000000003s)]
*  I don't recall. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3551.96s)]
*  To me, it seems like he did. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3553.44s)]
*  When you say I don't recall, [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3556.36s)]
*  it's a way of avoiding perjuring [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3558.4s)]
*  yourself, but also you're not [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3560.64s)]
*  telling the truth. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3562.84s)]
*  You don't have to tell the truth. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3564.6s)]

*  tough questions. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3574.04s)]
*  And look, there are huge [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3575.6s)]
*  consequences for everyone when [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3577.72s)]
*  these deportations happen without [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3580.4399999999996s)]

*  People get so mad about that. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3585.56s)]
*  I get it, I know. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3586.8799999999997s)]
*  I know that if you're here in [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3587.8399999999997s)]

*  I get that. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3595.7599999999998s)]

*  a court hearing, an opportunity to [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3599.04s)]

*  If you don't have a due process, [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3605.16s)]

*  to Abrego Garcia. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3613.8s)]

*  literally to US citizens that were [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3617.48s)]
*  mistakenly deported. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3619.36s)]
*  In fact, Time Magazine published [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3621.12s)]

*  President Trump's second term, [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3628.68s)]

*  administration to bring back at [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3632.2s)]
*  least four people that they've [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3634.16s)]
*  deported. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3636.08s)]
*  In the latest example, [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3636.68s)]
*  a court of appeals ordered the [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3638.04s)]

*  a confluence of administrative [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3663.96s)]

*  to actually value that system of [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3672.1600000000003s)]

*  a judge to make their case. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3681.08s)]

*  the federal government, again, [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3744.8s)]

*  You have to protect rights, [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3800.48s)]

*  infuriating to say the least. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3814.76s)]

*  administration. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=3844.96s)]

*  Down goes Cuomo, down goes Cuomo, [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4296.4800000000005s)]
*  down goes Cuomo. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4299.32s)]
*  Our members asked for it, [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4301.6s)]

*  I'm here to deliver, and [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4305.12s)]
*  it is a beautiful moment. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4306.56s)]
*  The democratic establishment has [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4308.36s)]
*  suffered a heavy blow, and [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4310.4800000000005s)]
*  more blows coming. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4312.12s)]
*  So it's a great, great moment, [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4313.44s)]
*  we'll dissect what's next in [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4315.68s)]
*  this race. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4317.8s)]
*  So since New York City has rank [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4319.6s)]
*  choice voting, elections work a [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4321.72s)]
*  little differently from what most [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4324.16s)]
*  Americans are used to. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4326.36s)]
*  So bear with me as I kind of [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4327.6s)]
*  explain the process. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4328.96s)]
*  Mamdani's support after the first [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4330.24s)]
*  round of vote continuing will [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4332.84s)]
*  remain below 50%. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4335.12s)]
*  And that means that the race will [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4337.04s)]
*  formally be decided by rank choice [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4339.24s)]
*  votes that will be announced [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4341.6s)]
*  beginning on July 1st. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4343.64s)]
*  Now, with 93% reporting in [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4345.44s)]
*  the first round, as you can see [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4347.6s)]
*  from this graphic, [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4350.08s)]
*  Mamdani was leading with 43.5% of [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4351.88s)]
*  the vote. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4354.96s)]
*  And since he cross endorsed with [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4355.8s)]
*  Brad Lander, who's a progressive [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4358.08s)]
*  who came third with 11.4% of [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4360.4400000000005s)]
*  the vote, he's predicted to benefit [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4362.64s)]
*  more than Cuomo from the next round [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4365.08s)]
*  of counting. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4367.4400000000005s)]
*  So you guys understand how that [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4368.72s)]
*  works, right? [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4369.8s)]
*  So Andrew Cuomo, who received 36.4% [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4370.320000000001s)]
*  has already conceded, [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4373.04s)]
*  although his campaign left the door [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4374.6s)]
*  open for a November run on a [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4376.92s)]
*  different party line, which has [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4378.72s)]
*  happened before. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4381.32s)]
*  I believe that happened in [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4382.4400000000005s)]
*  an election, a local election in [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4383.76s)]
*  Buffalo, New York, which was pretty [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4385.4400000000005s)]
*  gross and it totally worked. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4387.28s)]
*  So I would not be surprised if [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4388.6s)]
*  Cuomo tried this. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4390.16s)]
*  But Mamdani ran on an economically [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4391.08s)]
*  progressive platform. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4393.4800000000005s)]
*  He did not hide the fact that he [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4395.68s)]
*  identifies as a democratic [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4397.28s)]
*  socialist and he has promoted [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4398.76s)]
*  policies including a rent freeze [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4400.52s)]
*  on all stabilized tenants. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4402.56s)]
*  Tripling the city's production of [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4404.32s)]
*  affordable union built rent [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4406.84s)]
*  stabilized homes, making city [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4409.5199999999995s)]
*  buses free, raising taxes on the [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4411.84s)]
*  top 1% of earners and corporations, [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4414.36s)]
*  and creating a network of city [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4417.04s)]
*  owned grocery stores. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4418.96s)]
*  So he wants grocery stores to be [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4420.599999999999s)]
*  publicly owned instead of [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4422.28s)]
*  privately owned. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4423.72s)]
*  Now here's an outspoken critic. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4424.8s)]
*  He is an outspoken critic of [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4426.639999999999s)]
*  Israel's genocide in Gaza. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4429.04s)]
*  He's also very critical of Cuomo. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4431.72s)]
*  But look, Cuomo's supporters [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4435.28s)]
*  repeatedly accused him of being [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4438.0s)]
*  anti-Semitic specifically because [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4439.84s)]
*  he's been rightly critical of [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4442.04s)]
*  Israel's conduct. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4443.92s)]
*  And you might have seen there was [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4445.92s)]

*  being anti-Semitic. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4450.96s)]
*  And I gotta say the way he handled [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4452.48s)]
*  that was so good. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4454.5199999999995s)]
*  He didn't lose his patience, [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4456.16s)]
*  he was calm, he explained himself. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4457.759999999999s)]
*  And look, he's unfortunately being [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4460.0s)]

*  get accused of when we tell the [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4463.28s)]

*  what's happening in Gaza. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4466.24s)]
*  Now his supporters, [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4467.88s)]
*  Cuomo's supporters I should say, [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4469.48s)]
*  included Bill Clinton, [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4471.84s)]

*  Cuomo to win over Mamdani. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4481.24s)]
*  And amazingly, Politico found that [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4483.04s)]
*  more than 40% of Cuomo's top [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4484.88s)]

*  have come from people who publicly [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4488.12s)]
*  condemned him four years ago. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4489.84s)]
*  It's amazing. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4491.48s)]
*  Now just real quick, [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4492.8s)]
*  if you don't remember, [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4493.92s)]
*  Cuomo not only has been credibly [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4495.44s)]
*  accused of gross sexual misconduct [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4497.84s)]
*  by people who worked for [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4500.4s)]
*  him in the past, but he also made [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4502.16s)]
*  the horrible decision to send [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4504.719999999999s)]
*  elderly people who still had COVID [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4507.2s)]
*  back to nursing homes where the [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4510.04s)]
*  virus continued to spread and [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4512.44s)]
*  a lot of elderly people died as [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4514.719999999999s)]
*  a result. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4517.04s)]
*  I think that story is something [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4517.84s)]
*  that people should not forget [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4519.759999999999s)]
*  about because he messed with [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4521.48s)]
*  people's lives and that wasn't okay. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4523.12s)]
*  I know that these salacious [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4526.08s)]
*  stories tend to get more attention. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4527.36s)]
*  And by the way, [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4529.44s)]
*  sexual misconduct should absolutely [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4530.16s)]
*  get the attention. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4532.08s)]
*  But that doesn't mean you should [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4533.2s)]
*  forget about the other horrible [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4534.5199999999995s)]
*  things that Cuomo did as a leader, [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4535.96s)]
*  as the former mayor of New York [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4537.48s)]
*  City. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4538.92s)]
*  Now, yeah, so Cenk, [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4539.44s)]
*  I know you're chomping at the bit, [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4540.599999999999s)]
*  but I'm going to make you wait for [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4542.4s)]
*  just one more second. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4544.04s)]
*  Who voted for Mamdani? [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4545.2s)]
*  If you look at the borough level [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4546.96s)]
*  votes, he beat Cuomo in Brooklyn, [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4549.32s)]
*  Manhattan, and Queens, [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4551.84s)]
*  and he's about ahead in the Bronx [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4553.88s)]
*  and Staten Island, which that [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4556.16s)]
*  doesn't really surprise me. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4558.16s)]
*  Staten Island tends to be a little [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4559.84s)]
*  more conservative, but in the [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4561.56s)]
*  Bronx, which of course is [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4563.2s)]
*  represented by AOC. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4564.68s)]
*  I think, and this is just my guess, [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4566.08s)]
*  there has been more of a concern [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4568.68s)]
*  about disorder and crime and [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4571.04s)]
*  stuff like that in that area. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4573.32s)]
*  So maybe some of Mamdani's policies [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4575.68s)]
*  pertains to policing, turn them off. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4578.4400000000005s)]
*  That's just my guess. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4581.28s)]
*  But his coalition, again, [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4582.68s)]
*  largely consisted of a broad range [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4584.240000000001s)]
*  of people, including white, Asian, [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4586.360000000001s)]
*  and Latino voters in economically [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4588.76s)]
*  and racially diverse areas of [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4590.88s)]
*  the city. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4592.68s)]
*  Notably, he struggled more in [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4593.400000000001s)]
*  middle class, predominantly black [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4595.52s)]
*  areas in the Bronx and [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4598.12s)]
*  Southeast Queens, where Cuomo [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4599.72s)]
*  retained strong support from his [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4602.160000000001s)]
*  years as governor. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4604.6s)]
*  Cuomo also, that's right, [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4606.200000000001s)]
*  he was governor, my bad, [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4608.04s)]
*  I made a mistake earlier. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4609.68s)]
*  So he was governor. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4611.88s)]
*  Cuomo also won islands of support [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4613.080000000001s)]
*  on affluent democratic strongholds [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4615.6s)]

*  East sides of Manhattan. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4620.160000000001s)]

*  Brooklyn, where Mamdani's views on [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4624.68s)]
*  Israel alienated some voters. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4627.200000000001s)]

*  What did we do? [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4659.400000000001s)]
*  We said, let's just go ask people. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4660.72s)]
*  Let's go to the hearts of [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4663.040000000001s)]

*  just ask people, why did you do it? [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4673.68s)]
*  And we really made a sign that said, [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4675.56s)]

*  the world. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4693.52s)]

*  the wars, right? [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4701.8s)]

*  I'll vote for you. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4714.68s)]

*  tonight. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4716.8s)]
*  So reaching out to people who voted [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4719.36s)]
*  for Trump and [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4721.64s)]
*  to people who voted for Trump seems [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4722.64s)]
*  to have worked in this situation. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4725.120000000001s)]
*  I could be wrong, but [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4728.08s)]
*  that was my read of it. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4728.92s)]
*  What do you think, Cenk? [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4730.0s)]
*  Yeah, look, of course it's true, [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4731.280000000001s)]
*  but that's what people have to [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4733.6s)]
*  understand. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4735.64s)]
*  Reaching out to listen to them [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4737.72s)]
*  doesn't mean that you have to [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4739.04s)]
*  agree with them on their right wing [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4740.200000000001s)]

*  any of their right wing policies. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4743.6s)]
*  And so, but that doesn't mean that [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4745.280000000001s)]
*  you have to curse at them. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4747.04s)]
*  That doesn't mean you don't have to [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4748.240000000001s)]
*  talk to them. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4749.88s)]
*  It means you listen and [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4751.200000000001s)]
*  then you go, okay, let me pitch my [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4752.36s)]
*  ideas to you based on what I heard [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4754.12s)]
*  from you. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4756.0s)]
*  And let's see if there's [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4757.0s)]
*  intersection here. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4758.04s)]
*  And of course there is, [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4758.92s)]
*  everybody wants lower prices on [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4760.4s)]
*  housing and many other things that [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4762.24s)]
*  he pushed. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4764.4s)]
*  So we're going to do a lot of fun [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4765.36s)]
*  things here. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4767.16s)]
*  We're going to talk about his [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4767.92s)]
*  strategy and his substance. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4769.5199999999995s)]
*  One of the fun things I'll tell you [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4771.04s)]
*  about is, did I know this was [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4772.96s)]
*  coming? [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4774.679999999999s)]
*  Okay, I love predictions. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4775.88s)]
*  I'll tell you about that in a [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4777.679999999999s)]
*  second. But first I want to explain [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4778.4s)]
*  that that was a communications [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4779.759999999999s)]
*  director that you just watched for [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4781.16s)]
*  the campaign, Andrew Barnevstein. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4783.2s)]
*  And so I think they did a wonderful, [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4785.8s)]
*  amazing job with communications. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4787.84s)]
*  Not just in reaching out to Trump [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4790.08s)]
*  voters and seeing what they want. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4791.48s)]
*  That was a part of it and [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4792.96s)]
*  a good part of it and [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4794.2s)]
*  an important part of it. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4795.04s)]
*  But much more important was, my God, [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4796.0s)]
*  his social media, online media [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4798.48s)]
*  engagement was through the roof. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4800.5599999999995s)]
*  And he was so good at it. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4802.68s)]
*  He was so good at the debates. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4804.36s)]
*  So look, I'll tell you what I'm most [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4806.04s)]
*  excited about, which is, [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4808.2s)]
*  like two things that I get out of [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4810.56s)]
*  this. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4812.64s)]
*  Number one, the more the [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4813.08s)]
*  establishment is defeated, [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4814.68s)]
*  the happier I am. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4816.72s)]
*  So in this case, we're defeating [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4818.0s)]
*  the establishment from the left. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4820.2s)]
*  That's beautiful. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4822.6s)]
*  And of all the people who defeated [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4823.72s)]
*  the establishment, [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4825.32s)]
*  Andrew Cuomo, perfect, right? [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4826.24s)]
*  So and for me, the thing about [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4828.2s)]
*  Andrew Cuomo that always drove me [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4830.32s)]
*  crazy and is related to this race. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4832.28s)]
*  He always looks out for his donors. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4834.400000000001s)]
*  He's always looking out for [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4837.08s)]
*  him, always trying to protect [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4839.12s)]
*  the status quo. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4840.88s)]
*  And some of his top donors were [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4841.92s)]
*  real estate donors. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4843.64s)]
*  They have been historically and [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4844.8s)]
*  they were in this race. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4846.44s)]
*  One group alone gave him $2.5 [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4847.92s)]
*  million. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4849.48s)]
*  So the real estate industry gave [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4850.04s)]
*  him an enormous amount of money [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4852.08s)]
*  just for this small and [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4854.0s)]
*  quick mayoral race, right? [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4855.5599999999995s)]
*  And then Bloomberg gave him [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4858.2s)]
*  $8.3 million. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4860.24s)]
*  And I love to see that being [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4862.08s)]
*  wasted. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4863.64s)]
*  That's so beautiful to see, right? [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4864.6s)]
*  So all of this keep the status quo, [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4867.36s)]
*  didn't work. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4869.0s)]
*  We're in a new era. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4870.04s)]
*  We're just saying, it's okay, [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4872.04s)]
*  I'm the Democratic establishment. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4874.2s)]
*  I know what I'm doing and [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4876.84s)]
*  just vote for me. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4878.8s)]
*  I'm the only one who could win, [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4880.16s)]
*  not working at all anymore. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4882.4s)]
*  And I'm super psyched about it, [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4884.52s)]
*  right? [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4886.72s)]
*  So why do I think so, Ron? [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4887.24s)]
*  One, is it because of the district? [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4889.12s)]
*  No, and a big part of AOC's [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4893.36s)]
*  district is also in question. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4895.84s)]
*  Also in Queens. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4898.72s)]
*  I think that a couple of things [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4899.88s)]
*  have changed demographically and [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4902.08s)]
*  culturally in New York and [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4904.6s)]
*  across the country that are, [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4906.5s)]
*  I think, a little important. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4908.52s)]
*  Then I'm going to get to [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4910.6s)]
*  the big point. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4911.6s)]
*  So I remember when I was involved [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4913.08s)]
*  in the Just Democrat race when AOC [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4915.16s)]
*  won that historic primary also in [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4917.4800000000005s)]
*  New York, right, against Joe Crowley. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4919.72s)]
*  And in that case, we were rooting [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4922.12s)]
*  for low voter turnout. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4924.2s)]
*  We were trying to ambush them, [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4926.0s)]
*  basically. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4927.2s)]
*  Joe Crowley did not have as much [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4928.12s)]
*  name recognition in that district [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4929.68s)]
*  as they thought he did. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4931.48s)]
*  And we thought low voter turnout [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4932.5599999999995s)]
*  with young, energetic progressives [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4934.24s)]
*  in the district might make [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4936.24s)]
*  a difference, and it did. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4937.6s)]
*  And that was definitely [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4938.8s)]
*  the right strategy. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4939.64s)]
*  By the way, run by shortcut [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4940.48s)]
*  Chuck Abarty, who's currently [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4942.0s)]
*  running against Nancy Pelosi in [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4943.88s)]
*  a primary. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4945.64s)]
*  If he takes her out, good night, [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4946.28s)]
*  Irene, the establishment is wiped [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4948.44s)]
*  out. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4950.5199999999995s)]
*  So go check out Shortcut's campaign [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4951.08s)]
*  and make sure you're helping there. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4952.92s)]
*  He could be the next Zoran [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4954.72s)]
*  Mamdani. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4956.04s)]
*  Okay, so now though, those young [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4956.8s)]
*  progressives are a massive force [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4960.0s)]
*  in New York. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4963.08s)]
*  We didn't need low voter turnout. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4964.56s)]
*  This was a higher voter turnout [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4966.6s)]
*  election than historically than in [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4968.84s)]
*  the last couple of decades. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4971.56s)]
*  And it helped Mamdani, [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4974.04s)]
*  did not hurt Mamdani. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4975.16s)]
*  That means momentum is on our side, [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4976.400000000001s)]
*  okay? [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4978.4800000000005s)]
*  So now when you get to [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4979.2s)]
*  the substance of it, okay, now [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4980.2s)]
*  here's where it gets a little [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4981.76s)]
*  interesting. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4983.2s)]
*  Because when I look at [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4983.92s)]
*  the particular policies that he [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4985.4s)]
*  pushed, I'm so curious about them [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4987.799999999999s)]
*  because they're not the ones [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4990.44s)]
*  I would have picked. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4992.639999999999s)]
*  I'll be honest with you guys, [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4994.28s)]
*  right? [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4996.08s)]
*  And so, but number one, [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4996.599999999999s)]
*  they're change as opposed to [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=4998.44s)]
*  the status quo. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5000.639999999999s)]
*  So, right, let's try them. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5002.0s)]
*  Let's try them and [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5004.88s)]
*  see what happens, right? [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5005.639999999999s)]
*  And I'm genuinely curious to see, [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5007.28s)]
*  can he really raise corporate taxes [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5009.28s)]
*  by that much in New York? [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5011.24s)]
*  Will some of them leave or [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5012.88s)]
*  will all of them stay? [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5013.92s)]
*  And then thereby disprove [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5015.04s)]
*  the mythology that they're all [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5016.44s)]
*  going to leave. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5018.04s)]
*  So I'm very excited about that one. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5018.84s)]
*  I like that one and I'm curious to [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5020.88s)]
*  see what rate of increase is going [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5023.2s)]
*  to be sustainable, right? [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5025.6s)]
*  That's going to work, [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5027.2s)]
*  keep the companies there and [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5028.44s)]
*  produce the revenue that we need. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5030.2s)]
*  He would not back off of the BDS [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5032.56s)]
*  movement against Israel. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5034.96s)]
*  His strength there was through [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5037.6s)]
*  the roof, I loved it. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5039.24s)]
*  Okay, so that's my favorite policy [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5040.32s)]
*  that he's got, but I know it [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5042.36s)]
*  doesn't relate much to New York. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5044.44s)]
*  But so rent control, [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5046.36s)]
*  I've historically think it has [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5047.64s)]
*  problems in the market, but we've [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5049.68s)]
*  got to try to lower the housing [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5051.84s)]
*  prices somehow. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5053.64s)]
*  Nationally, I think it's by [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5055.04s)]
*  banning private equity from buying [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5056.04s)]
*  residential real estate. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5057.4800000000005s)]
*  That's in our populist playing. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5058.8s)]
*  In a city, I get why they want to [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5060.32s)]
*  do a rent control freeze. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5062.12s)]
*  I'm a little worried about the [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5064.16s)]
*  market dynamics there, but [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5065.64s)]
*  I think it's worth trying to see [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5067.04s)]
*  how it goes. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5068.64s)]
*  Same thing for school buses, [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5069.2s)]
*  same for free childcare. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5070.8s)]
*  Can they really do it? [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5072.56s)]
*  Does that make a big difference? [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5073.64s)]
*  And then finally on defund the [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5076.360000000001s)]
*  police, it has a program to move [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5078.04s)]
*  some of the funding to community [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5079.96s)]
*  service programs. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5081.76s)]
*  Again, I'm very curious, [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5083.64s)]
*  is that going to work? [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5084.72s)]
*  Is that going, [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5085.52s)]
*  could it lower crime? [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5086.160000000001s)]
*  Does it increase crime? [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5087.04s)]
*  Obviously, we will give you an [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5088.320000000001s)]
*  honest assessment of that at some [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5089.92s)]
*  point, and we're not going to play [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5091.64s)]
*  around with the numbers and tell [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5093.280000000001s)]
*  you worked if it didn't work, or [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5094.8s)]
*  tell you that it didn't work if it [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5096.280000000001s)]
*  did work, right? [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5097.68s)]
*  So we're going to be fair and [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5098.96s)]
*  honest about that. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5100.0s)]
*  And I want to see him try these [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5100.8s)]
*  things because change is so [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5102.4s)]
*  much better than not changing. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5103.96s)]
*  And he's trying to address these [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5106.24s)]
*  folks, and that gets to my most [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5107.839999999999s)]
*  important point, which is, guys, [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5109.639999999999s)]
*  we've been asking for [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5112.04s)]
*  change the whole time. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5113.5599999999995s)]
*  And would I have picked a different [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5115.5199999999995s)]
*  policy than government run grocery [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5118.4s)]
*  stores? [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5121.48s)]
*  Definitely, but [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5123.48s)]
*  maybe I wouldn't have won, right? [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5124.719999999999s)]
*  So he picked these policies, [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5126.88s)]
*  they voted for him. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5128.5199999999995s)]
*  So let's give him a shot to run [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5130.12s)]
*  these policies and [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5131.68s)]
*  see if they're brilliant, [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5132.64s)]
*  see if they totally work. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5134.08s)]
*  And did I see this coming in? [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5135.76s)]
*  No, I didn't, because I was used to [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5138.0s)]
*  the AOC era where you had to have [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5140.200000000001s)]
*  low voter turnout. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5142.360000000001s)]
*  And if you had the establishment [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5144.16s)]
*  show up in a race this big, [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5146.16s)]
*  that they were going to, [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5147.68s)]
*  especially with the ads and stuff, [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5149.0s)]
*  I have seen them overwhelm us time [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5151.08s)]
*  and time again. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5152.96s)]
*  And Zoran was not running on [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5153.76s)]
*  mild policies. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5156.400000000001s)]
*  He was running on pretty [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5159.52s)]
*  aggressively socialist policies. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5161.04s)]
*  And so, but I think that his [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5163.76s)]
*  strengths, whether the New Yorkers [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5165.56s)]
*  agree with those policies, etc., [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5168.0s)]
*  we're going to find out as we go [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5170.28s)]
*  along. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5172.08s)]
*  But the fact that he was so [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5172.6s)]
*  strong about it and said, yeah, [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5174.04s)]
*  that's right. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5176.0s)]
*  I'm not backing off my position on [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5177.28s)]
*  Israel, and I'm not backing off any [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5179.04s)]
*  of these policies. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5181.0s)]
*  That was wonderful to see and [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5182.28s)]
*  the right strategy. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5184.0s)]
*  Okay, I need to jump in, [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5185.8s)]
*  especially when you say you didn't [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5187.16s)]
*  expect this to be the outcome of [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5189.36s)]
*  the race. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5191.12s)]
*  Well, it turns out that [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5192.04s)]
*  Andrew Cuomo's top donor also [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5193.44s)]
*  didn't expect this to be the [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5195.28s)]
*  outcome. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5197.0s)]
*  And this is amazing. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5198.28s)]
*  So just bear with me as I read [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5199.32s)]
*  this, this was reported by [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5200.84s)]
*  the New York Times. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5202.32s)]
*  As donors try to assess their next [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5203.92s)]
*  moves in the mayoral race, [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5206.12s)]
*  one of the biggest donors to [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5208.08s)]
*  Andrew Cuomo's super PAC, [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5210.08s)]
*  the investor Mark Gorton, said he [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5211.96s)]
*  is likely to back Mom Donnie. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5214.599999999999s)]
*  That is because of the support [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5218.36s)]
*  that Mom Donnie had gotten from [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5220.639999999999s)]
*  Brad Lander, who Gorton said he [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5223.0s)]
*  ranked first. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5225.44s)]
*  I feel like people misunderstood [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5226.5599999999995s)]
*  my $250,000 for Cuomo for [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5228.679999999999s)]
*  real enthusiasm, [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5230.5199999999995s)]
*  he said in an interview. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5231.839999999999s)]
*  It was basically, looks like [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5233.719999999999s)]
*  Cuomo is coming back. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5236.12s)]
*  We don't want to be shut out. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5237.679999999999s)]
*  Let's try to get on his good side. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5240.0s)]
*  That's kind of how things work with [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5242.679999999999s)]
*  Cuomo. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5244.879999999999s)]
*  It's sad political pragmatism. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5245.8s)]
*  I wish we lived in a world where [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5248.24s)]
*  those sort of things were not [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5250.24s)]
*  useful things to do. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5252.2s)]
*  Yeah, that's so telling. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5253.64s)]
*  It's amazing. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5256.76s)]
*  First of all, I look forward to [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5257.360000000001s)]
*  giving somebody $250,000 just [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5259.320000000001s)]
*  because I'm not enthusiastic about [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5261.4800000000005s)]
*  them. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5263.8s)]
*  Wow, what a stunning amount of [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5265.400000000001s)]
*  money to give when you're not [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5267.280000000001s)]
*  enthusiastic. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5269.04s)]
*  Okay, so I hope he's enthusiastic [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5270.08s)]
*  about Mom Donnie because that might [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5271.92s)]
*  be a decent number. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5273.88s)]
*  But look at the kind of corruption [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5275.2s)]
*  that Andrew Cuomo ran. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5277.12s)]
*  And this is very true of Cuomo and [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5278.5599999999995s)]
*  the Clintons. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5280.72s)]
*  They would make a list and [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5282.24s)]
*  if you didn't bribe them, [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5283.679999999999s)]
*  you're going to be in a lot of [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5285.0s)]
*  trouble. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5286.4s)]
*  And if you did bribe them, then you [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5287.2s)]
*  were on the good guy list and [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5288.8s)]
*  you were going to get a goodie, [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5290.04s)]
*  not from Cuomo, but [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5291.5199999999995s)]
*  from the taxpayers. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5292.639999999999s)]
*  Isn't that extortion? [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5294.24s)]
*  Of course it is. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5296.84s)]
*  I mean, but it's bribery, [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5297.679999999999s)]
*  it's extortion, [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5298.76s)]
*  it's all these things. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5299.48s)]
*  So gross. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5300.36s)]
*  But the Supreme Court made it all [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5301.32s)]
*  legal. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5302.76s)]
*  So they're like, [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5303.32s)]
*  it is a campaign contribution. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5304.48s)]
*  I am speaking to you. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5306.0s)]
*  So look, it's interesting how [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5307.679999999999s)]
*  quickly Cuomo's donors have given [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5309.679999999999s)]
*  up, how quickly Cuomo gave up. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5312.16s)]
*  Because technically, [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5314.0s)]
*  Mom Donnie hasn't won yet. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5315.12s)]
*  He's at 43.6, he's got to get to [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5316.96s)]
*  50 so that this is the only round [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5319.28s)]
*  of voting, right? [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5321.679999999999s)]
*  And we think he's going to get to [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5323.96s)]
*  50 because of the Lander votes and [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5325.719999999999s)]
*  maybe others. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5327.5199999999995s)]
*  But man, Cuomo's like, forget it, [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5328.639999999999s)]
*  I give up right away. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5330.28s)]
*  Okay, which is great to see. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5331.639999999999s)]
*  But don't get too excited about [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5333.4s)]
*  that. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5335.12s)]
*  Ana's definitely right about that [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5335.639999999999s)]

*  back. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5341.04s)]
*  And not only in this case, [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5341.759999999999s)]
*  you have the pro status quo, [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5343.36s)]

*  okay? [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5359.44s)]
*  And I'm super proud of the Jewish [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5360.28s)]
*  community in New York that was not [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5362.24s)]

*  Mamdani's win and the fact that he [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5397.92s)]
*  appears poised to win in the end [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5400.4400000000005s)]
*  of this election cycle. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5402.88s)]
*  He front loaded the economic [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5405.76s)]
*  policies, okay? [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5407.360000000001s)]
*  He sure would comment on some of [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5409.12s)]
*  the social issues in the country. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5410.8s)]
*  Obviously he commented on foreign [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5413.12s)]
*  policy as well as it pertains to [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5414.64s)]
*  what's happening in the Middle [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5415.96s)]
*  East. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5417.200000000001s)]
*  However, he front loaded economic [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5417.76s)]
*  policies. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5420.44s)]
*  And that's what matters to most [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5422.24s)]
*  Americans, especially in a city [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5423.96s)]
*  like New York, [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5426.16s)]
*  where the cost of living is [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5427.2s)]
*  astronomical. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5428.879999999999s)]
*  And reaching out to people who [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5430.759999999999s)]

*  for Democrats, who voted for [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5434.48s)]
*  Trump in the last election cycle [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5436.04s)]
*  is so important. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5437.879999999999s)]
*  Even if you can't persuade them, [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5439.08s)]
*  you at least get an understanding [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5441.12s)]
*  of where that base is at. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5443.24s)]
*  What it is about Trump that [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5445.24s)]
*  persuaded them to vote for [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5446.799999999999s)]
*  a man like that. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5448.36s)]
*  Again, for everyone who denies [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5449.679999999999s)]
*  that Trump's faux economic [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5452.04s)]
*  populism is what persuaded people [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5454.0s)]
*  to support him, I think it's pretty [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5456.5199999999995s)]
*  clear that in reaching out to these [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5459.04s)]
*  Trump voters and talking about [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5461.48s)]
*  the economic policies that Mamdani [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5463.639999999999s)]
*  wants to champion, who's able to [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5466.0s)]
*  bring some people over onto his [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5468.16s)]
*  side, and so that's how you win. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5470.08s)]
*  It reminds me of what Trump did in [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5472.08s)]
*  the last presidential election when [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5473.839999999999s)]
*  he spoke before a conference of [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5475.839999999999s)]
*  voters who booed him. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5477.8s)]
*  They totally booed him. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5478.68s)]
*  Everyone on the left was [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5480.08s)]
*  clowning on him. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5481.360000000001s)]
*  But I saw it differently because to [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5482.96s)]
*  me that was Trump going into [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5485.0s)]
*  hostile territory, reaching out to [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5486.56s)]
*  voters and trying to make his case. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5488.64s)]
*  That's how you win. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5491.0s)]
*  So anyway, we've got more to get to [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5492.68s)]
*  in this story. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5494.16s)]
*  So let's take a quick break and [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5494.92s)]
*  we'll come back and [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5496.12s)]

*  down. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5870.48s)]
*  One good way to do it is to stop [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5871.0s)]
*  all business and [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5872.32s)]
*  drive everybody out. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5873.0s)]

*  And then they fall through. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5889.16s)]
*  I mean, there is a class warfare [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5891.5599999999995s)]
*  that's going to- [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5893.5199999999995s)]

*  The eat the rich. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5896.5199999999995s)]
*  Another reason why President [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5900.84s)]
*  Roosevelt pursued the New Deal is [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5902.5199999999995s)]

*  capitalism. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5906.08s)]
*  I'm not kidding. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5906.88s)]
*  That was literally a quote of his. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5907.44s)]
*  He saw that the inequality was [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5909.76s)]
*  leading to a rise in socialism in [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5912.5599999999995s)]
*  the country. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5915.599999999999s)]
*  And he was worried that it was [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5917.5599999999995s)]
*  going to affect our capitalistic [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5919.08s)]
*  economy. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5921.04s)]
*  So he's like, [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5922.5199999999995s)]
*  the rich have gone a little too [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5923.24s)]
*  greedy. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5924.5599999999995s)]
*  We need to do something about this. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5925.08s)]
*  And the same is happening now. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5926.96s)]
*  But these greedy folks over at CNBC [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5931.12s)]
*  don't want to do a damn thing to [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5933.32s)]
*  fix it. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5935.12s)]
*  They like the system the way it is. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5935.88s)]
*  But if you want to see why or [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5938.08s)]
*  you want to understand why someone [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5939.88s)]
*  who has identified himself as [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5942.4s)]
*  a socialist openly, overtly, [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5944.64s)]
*  is somehow appealing to the public. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5947.08s)]
*  It's because all of that inequality [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5949.72s)]
*  has been destroying their lives for [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5951.92s)]
*  decades now. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5954.16s)]
*  And so the other part of it is, [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5955.84s)]
*  Cenk, I got to admit, [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5957.84s)]
*  even I watched that compilation of [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5959.44s)]
*  CNBC hosts, like injected in my [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5961.88s)]
*  veins. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5964.4s)]
*  Like watching that panic is kind of [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5965.76s)]
*  cathartic. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5968.24s)]
*  Because they got way too greedy. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5969.2s)]
*  They got way too confident and [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5971.88s)]
*  cocky. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5973.76s)]
*  And if you want to save capitalism, [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5974.64s)]
*  the American people have to feel [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5977.68s)]
*  that capitalism is working for [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5979.64s)]
*  them and right now they're not [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5981.6s)]
*  feeling that way. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5983.56s)]
*  Inequality has been exploding year [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5984.400000000001s)]
*  after year. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5986.4800000000005s)]
*  People can't afford their freaking [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5987.52s)]
*  rent. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5989.28s)]
*  So when you have a candidate who [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5990.0s)]
*  says I'm a socialist and [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5991.4800000000005s)]
*  I want to make housing affordable, [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5992.52s)]
*  and the other guy, [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5994.28s)]
*  a corporate Democrat, [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5995.2s)]
*  Andrew Cuomo, has really no [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5996.360000000001s)]
*  solution at all. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5997.76s)]
*  Yeah, it's not surprising that they [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=5998.88s)]
*  would support Mom Donnie over Cuomo. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6000.8s)]
*  And by the way, Cuomo is now [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6002.88s)]
*  threatening to run in the next [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6004.56s)]
*  round of this rank choice voting [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6006.44s)]
*  process as an independent hoping [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6008.36s)]
*  that he can win. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6010.4s)]
*  We'll see if that works. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6011.28s)]
*  But what do you think, Cenk? [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6012.839999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so that would be in [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6014.48s)]
*  the general election, of course. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6015.28s)]
*  So first of all, I love the smell [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6016.32s)]
*  of establishment panic in [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6018.2s)]
*  the morning. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6019.839999999999s)]
*  And so that they're 100% panic. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6020.879999999999s)]
*  Secondly, look, [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6024.08s)]
*  there's super important genie has [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6025.2s)]

*  For my entire life, [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6029.36s)]
*  mainstream media has been trying to [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6030.719999999999s)]
*  make sure that Democrats can [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6033.44s)]
*  vote, Democrats don't really serve [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6035.88s)]
*  the average voter. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6038.68s)]
*  And they always do propaganda like, [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6039.96s)]
*  I mean, socialism is going to work [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6042.4800000000005s)]
*  here, okay, what are they like, [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6044.68s)]
*  Mao and Cuba and Fidel Castro and [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6047.12s)]
*  Mao, this is the kind of [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6049.72s)]
*  horse crap propaganda I've heard [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6051.4800000000005s)]
*  my whole life. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6054.08s)]
*  And by the way, not just on Fox [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6055.64s)]
*  News, but all over cable news, [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6057.12s)]
*  right? [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6058.68s)]
*  Anytime you try to help the average [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6059.2s)]
*  American in any way, shape or form, [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6060.92s)]
*  they smear the living crap out of [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6062.68s)]
*  you, right? [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6064.24s)]
*  So in this case, he's like, look, [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6065.24s)]
*  for example, I don't love [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6067.4800000000005s)]
*  rent control, I don't think it's [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6069.4400000000005s)]
*  necessarily the right way to keep [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6071.72s)]
*  housing prices down, but should we [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6073.88s)]
*  try something to keep housing [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6076.24s)]
*  prices down? [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6078.280000000001s)]
*  Of course, of course. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6079.16s)]
*  So Cuomo's answer was, [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6080.08s)]
*  I'm going to take money from real [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6081.4400000000005s)]
*  estate interests and serve them. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6083.400000000001s)]
*  That's a terrible answer, [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6085.4400000000005s)]
*  terrible, right? [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6087.24s)]
*  And media is like, [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6089.08s)]
*  what a brilliant idea. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6089.96s)]
*  Take money from real estate [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6091.24s)]
*  interests and let them rob everyone [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6092.52s)]
*  in New York as much as they like. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6094.28s)]
*  No, not a good idea, awful idea. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6096.32s)]
*  So Zoran's idea is, hey, [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6098.48s)]
*  I'm going to try to control [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6099.88s)]
*  the pricing somehow, right? [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6101.32s)]
*  And I'm going to try this and [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6103.48s)]
*  let's see if it works. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6104.5599999999995s)]
*  But mainly, I'm addressing your [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6105.679999999999s)]
*  number one concern. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6107.8s)]
*  See, politics isn't that [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6109.96s)]
*  complicated. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6111.16s)]
*  You just have to get around [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6112.16s)]
*  mainstream media. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6113.28s)]
*  And he did through social media and [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6114.4s)]
*  through so many other ways, [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6116.2s)]
*  he got his message to the people. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6117.639999999999s)]
*  I'm actually going to try to do [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6119.32s)]
*  something about your housing [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6121.12s)]
*  prices. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6122.84s)]
*  And that's the thing you care most [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6123.68s)]
*  about. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6125.280000000001s)]
*  When Catherine Wilde, [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6125.88s)]

*  the business community and [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6130.8s)]
*  how they feel about Mom Donnie, [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6132.52s)]
*  she simply replied terrified. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6134.68s)]
*  Bradley Tusk, CEO of Tusk Ventures, [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6138.76s)]
*  warned that while unlikely, [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6141.8s)]
*  New York could go the way of once [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6144.12s)]
*  very prosperous cities like Detroit [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6146.4800000000005s)]
*  and Baltimore that had really big [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6149.240000000001s)]
*  tax bases and then got dirty and [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6152.04s)]
*  dangerous and the taxes went up too [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6154.4800000000005s)]
*  much and people left. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6157.2s)]
*  And- [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6159.08s)]
*  That's not happened at all. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6160.08s)]
*  Okay, sorry. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6161.6s)]
*  Just jump in real quick. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6163.04s)]
*  Things like the car industry got [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6164.68s)]
*  hurt in Detroit. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6166.8s)]
*  That's what happened in Detroit. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6168.08s)]
*  These guys love to lie, man. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6169.88s)]
*  So is Wall Street going to move out [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6171.72s)]
*  of New York because of Mom Donnie? [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6174.2s)]
*  I would be dramatically surprised. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6176.96s)]
*  So let's see what happens. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6179.52s)]
*  But this is a lot of fear mongering. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6180.96s)]
*  Don't vote against the rich. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6183.24s)]
*  Whatever you do, [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6184.76s)]
*  don't vote against the rich. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6185.64s)]
*  And Democratic leadership seems [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6187.08s)]
*  super thrilled about this. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6189.08s)]
*  Obviously, I'm kidding. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6190.56s)]
*  Because if you take a look at how [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6191.96s)]
*  Hakeem Jeffries, who is the House [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6193.8s)]
*  minority leader, responded to [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6195.72s)]
*  a question about Mom Donnie on [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6197.52s)]
*  Morning Joe this morning, [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6199.36s)]
*  you'll kind of get a sense that [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6200.96s)]
*  leadership not so happy. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6202.72s)]
*  Take a look. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6204.16s)]
*  I'm curious what your thoughts are [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6205.36s)]
*  on him ideologically. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6207.4s)]
*  Ideologically, does he have an [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6209.08s)]
*  ideology that you would want your [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6211.64s)]
*  candidates in 2026 to have? [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6214.36s)]
*  Well, from the standpoint of House [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6216.72s)]
*  Democrats and what our focus has [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6219.48s)]
*  been, clearly, we have an [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6222.08s)]
*  affordability crisis in the United [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6224.04s)]
*  States of America. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6226.76s)]
*  And our focus will continue to be [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6228.2s)]
*  on driving down the high cost of [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6230.56s)]
*  living in this country. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6232.92s)]
*  Donald Trump promised to lower [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6234.6s)]
*  costs on day one, [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6236.64s)]
*  costs haven't gone down, [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6237.8s)]
*  they're going up. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6239.6s)]
*  He's crashing the economy in real [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6240.88s)]
*  time, his tariffs are going to [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6243.2s)]
*  impose thousands of dollars in [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6245.24s)]
*  additional cost on everyday [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6247.360000000001s)]
*  Americans per year. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6249.320000000001s)]
*  And he may even be driving us [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6250.6s)]
*  toward a recession. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6251.84s)]
*  That's the reason why Donald Trump [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6252.72s)]
*  has become so unpopular. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6254.2s)]
*  Okay, so look, I don't know if [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6258.08s)]
*  that was an example of robot [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6260.16s)]
*  Hakeem Jeffries just going back to [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6262.16s)]
*  the Trump bad talking points when [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6264.6s)]
*  he's asked something specific [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6266.8s)]
*  about a local mayoral race. [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6269.2s)]
*  But the fact that he had this [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6271.56s)]
*  inability to say anything about [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6273.400000000001s)]
*  Mondani specifically, I don't know. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6275.56s)]
*  It kind of tells me everything I [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6278.360000000001s)]
*  need to know about how shills, [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6280.84s)]
*  corporate goons like Hakeem [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6283.24s)]
*  Jeffries feel about Mondani and [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6285.2s)]
*  his economic policies, yeah. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6287.400000000001s)]
*  And I think there's two things [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6289.4400000000005s)]
*  going on here, actually three [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6290.68s)]
*  things happening here. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6291.88s)]
*  So number one, do you want to run [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6292.88s)]
*  every race in the country with [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6295.879999999999s)]
*  Mom Donnie's policies that he won [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6298.48s)]
*  in New York City with? [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6301.599999999999s)]
*  No, to be honest, right? [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6304.24s)]
*  because New York City is deep blue. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6306.5599999999995s)]
*  And so he did a brilliant job of [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6308.719999999999s)]
*  running with the right policies in [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6310.679999999999s)]
*  the right place, right? [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6312.759999999999s)]
*  But if you run with those same [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6314.5199999999995s)]
*  exact policies, some of them, [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6315.639999999999s)]
*  by the way, will be very popular [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6316.599999999999s)]
*  in Wichita. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6317.799999999999s)]
*  Because everybody cares about [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6319.36s)]
*  housing prices, etc. [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6320.32s)]
*  And some of them won't be. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6321.5599999999995s)]
*  And so, like if Hakeem Jeffries [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6323.0s)]
*  said, hey, listen, everybody's [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6324.92s)]
*  going to run their own campaign. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6326.76s)]
*  But I love the Zoran one, but [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6328.28s)]
*  every candidate is their own [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6329.84s)]
*  person, no problem, right? [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6331.36s)]
*  But he did the corporate robot [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6333.08s)]
*  thing and then he switched to [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6334.6s)]
*  the Donald Trump talking points. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6336.04s)]
*  You're absolutely right about that. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6338.28s)]
*  But there's two other reasons why [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6339.48s)]
*  Hakeem Jeffries is concerned that [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6341.08s)]
*  are not legitimate. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6342.72s)]
*  So one is, this guy is super [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6344.16s)]
*  progressive and in New York, [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6347.6s)]
*  Hakeem Jeffries is from New York [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6351.76s)]
*  and Chuck Schumer is from New York. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6353.72s)]
*  And they're both worried to death [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6355.84s)]
*  about a progressive [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6357.76s)]
*  primary challenger. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6358.72s)]
*  So they're like, [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6360.16s)]
*  let me tell you about Donald Trump. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6361.16s)]
*  Let me tell you about Donald Trump. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6363.72s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I thought. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6364.64s)]
*  They're in a cold sweat paddock. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6365.64s)]
*  In fact, if AOC announces a Senate [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6366.8s)]
*  race against Chuck Schumer, [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6371.0s)]
*  boom, it's over. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6372.56s)]
*  After these results, [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6373.76s)]
*  Chuck Schumer will just retire. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6374.64s)]
*  There's no way he's going to get [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6376.24s)]
*  embarrassed by AOC. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6377.44s)]
*  And everybody knows AOC is going to [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6379.0s)]
*  win. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6380.44s)]
*  So that's her Senate seat to pick [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6380.96s)]
*  up if she wants it, right? [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6382.96s)]
*  Schumer will run for the hills. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6385.5599999999995s)]
*  And then there's a third factor. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6387.2s)]
*  And the third factor is, remember, [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6388.639999999999s)]
*  all these guys are loaded up with [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6390.96s)]
*  APAC money. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6392.96s)]
*  So when they see Mom Donnie, [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6394.16s)]
*  they've already gotten marching [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6395.879999999999s)]
*  orders, know that you are all [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6398.16s)]
*  Democratic leadership must be [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6400.12s)]
*  opposed to Mom Donnie. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6402.24s)]
*  And they try to stay out of that [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6404.48s)]
*  race, but we all know they were [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6406.0s)]
*  back in Cuomo, especially Schumer. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6407.599999999999s)]
*  So now that their guy lost, yeah, [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6409.92s)]
*  they're pretty somber about it. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6412.04s)]
*  Yeah, a bunch of right wingers are [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6415.0s)]
*  super Islamophobic and [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6417.04s)]
*  hateful toward him because he's [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6418.68s)]
*  the first Muslim. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6420.64s)]
*  If he wins, he'd be the first [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6422.0s)]
*  Muslim mayor of New York City. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6423.24s)]
*  We don't have time to get to all of [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6424.64s)]
*  them, but I'll read what Laura [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6426.08s)]
*  Loomer posted because she's [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6427.56s)]
*  a bigoted piece of trash. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6429.08s)]
*  She says if the Muslim Brotherhood [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6431.08s)]
*  would have been designated as [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6433.64s)]
*  a terrorist organization, [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6435.88s)]
*  Mom Donnie could have been [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6438.2s)]
*  prevented from running for office. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6439.8s)]
*  Listen, honestly, [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6442.639999999999s)]
*  Laura Loomer is bottom of the [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6444.04s)]
*  barrel, okay, perfectly happy to [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6445.96s)]
*  risk the lives of our soldiers in [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6448.32s)]
*  wars on behalf of Israel. [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6450.48s)]
*  And she has the audacity to impugn [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6452.36s)]
*  the character of a guy simply [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6454.44s)]
*  because he's Muslim, [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6456.28s)]
*  simply because he's Muslim. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6457.68s)]
*  And by the way, [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6459.4s)]
*  you don't like his policies, [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6460.2s)]
*  that's fine. [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6461.76s)]
*  Go ahead and talk about his [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6463.4s)]
*  policies, talk about why you don't [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6464.48s)]
*  like those policies, you don't [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6465.96s)]
*  think they're going to work. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6467.32s)]
*  But attacking someone simply [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6468.44s)]
*  because they're Muslim is gross. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6470.96s)]
*  Just like maybe I'll put it in [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6474.28s)]
*  the context that Laura Loomer [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6475.48s)]
*  can understand. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6476.599999999999s)]
*  Just like how it's disgusting when [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6477.28s)]
*  someone is attacked for being [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6479.88s)]
*  Jewish, that's unacceptable, right? [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6481.799999999999s)]
*  So why is it acceptable for [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6484.92s)]
*  her to specifically attack him [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6486.88s)]
*  over his identity? [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6489.12s)]
*  And I've seen it all over the place. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6490.96s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor Greene, [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6493.32s)]
*  this is disgusting. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6495.04s)]
*  She shared an image of the Statue [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6496.72s)]
*  of Liberty, obviously wearing, [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6499.16s)]
*  what is that, a niqab? [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6501.8s)]
*  Burka. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6504.240000000001s)]
*  Or a burka, yeah, gross. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6505.12s)]
*  It's just gross all the way around, [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6507.16s)]
*  accusations that now Sharia law is [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6509.4400000000005s)]
*  coming to New York City. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6511.68s)]
*  It's pretty gross how bigoted and [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6513.04s)]
*  openly Islamophobic, [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6515.92s)]
*  pretty prominent members of [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6518.0s)]
*  the right happen to be. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6520.320000000001s)]
*  Again, you don't like his policies, [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6522.320000000001s)]
*  attack his policies. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6523.6s)]
*  But when you attack his identity, [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6524.400000000001s)]
*  it makes you look dumb and [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6526.6s)]
*  hateful and that's it. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6528.08s)]
*  Yeah, so Charlie Kirk wrote 24 years [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6529.64s)]
*  ago, a group of Muslims killed [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6532.320000000001s)]
*  2,753 people on 9-11. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6534.64s)]
*  Now a Muslim socialist is on pace [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6536.72s)]
*  to run New York City. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6539.04s)]
*  And a Muslim plumber will [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6541.68s)]
*  co-show up and [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6543.4400000000005s)]
*  help you with your sink later [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6544.52s)]

*  remove your cavity. [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6548.320000000001s)]

*  folks? [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6552.08s)]
*  So look, you know what's going on [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6553.280000000001s)]
*  here. [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6555.200000000001s)]
*  And this is part of the problem [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6555.7s)]
*  with the radical right, obviously. [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6556.8s)]
*  It's the main problem with [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6558.54s)]
*  the radical right. [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6559.42s)]
*  They also have their purity tests, [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6560.38s)]
*  but their purity tests are [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6562.54s)]
*  oftentimes based on race, [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6564.099999999999s)]
*  religion, ethnic background. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6565.82s)]
*  And if you're not one of them, [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6568.0599999999995s)]
*  then you're part of the 9-11 [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6569.94s)]
*  bombers. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6571.78s)]
*  What's amazing to me is what Anna [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6572.94s)]
*  referred to there, that if you said [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6575.42s)]
*  this about Jewish people, [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6578.139999999999s)]
*  something like, I don't know, [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6580.0599999999995s)]
*  son of Sam was a serial killer in [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6582.62s)]
*  the city in the 1970s and [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6585.26s)]
*  he was Jewish. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6587.42s)]
*  And now a Jewish guy has won [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6588.900000000001s)]
*  the mayorship. [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6590.540000000001s)]
*  You'd be like, what? [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6591.42s)]
*  Okay, number one, [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6592.34s)]
*  enormously hateful. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6593.780000000001s)]
*  But number two, super random. [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6595.34s)]
*  Are you really that dumb that you [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6598.5s)]
*  think that every Jewish person [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6600.540000000001s)]
*  acts the same? [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6602.22s)]
*  And that's basically what I asked [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6603.700000000001s)]
*  Charlie Kirk on X. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6605.9400000000005s)]
*  I'm like, do you really think that [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6607.06s)]
*  all Muslims are like the 9-11 [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6609.620000000001s)]
*  bombers? [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6612.06s)]
*  Can anyone really be that ignorant? [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6614.0199999999995s)]
*  And then as you see the replies [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6617.82s)]
*  from some of the radical right, [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6619.459999999999s)]
*  the answer is, yeah, yeah, [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6621.259999999999s)]
*  a lot of people can be that [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6623.0599999999995s)]
*  incredibly ignorant. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6624.7s)]
*  They really have it in their mind [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6626.78s)]
*  and it got there partly through [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6628.219999999999s)]
*  right wing media and [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6629.5s)]
*  partly through mainstream media. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6630.54s)]
*  And that's why I was so enraged [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6631.82s)]
*  about mainstream media just a couple [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6633.379999999999s)]
*  of days ago, right, on this issue. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6635.0599999999995s)]
*  They really drilled it into [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6637.379999999999s)]
*  people's heads that Muslims are [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6638.98s)]
*  terrorists and savage and violent, [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6640.82s)]
*  and that's all they are. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=6643.099999999999s)]

*  Trump ran a campaign on the [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7017.660000000001s)]

*  some of these social safety net [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7029.46s)]

*  Honestly, that was part of [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7037.46s)]
*  the reason why during the Republican [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7038.7s)]

*  with the status quo GOP, [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7071.88s)]
*  Trump was your guy. [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7073.38s)]

*  what are your thoughts about [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7076.18s)]
*  this strategy? [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7077.84s)]
*  I think it's obvious. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7079.68s)]
*  People are saying, that's bold. [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7081.240000000001s)]
*  That's what a crazy strategy. [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7084.160000000001s)]
*  Why is it crazy? [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7086.08s)]
*  Trump just used it to win. [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7087.0s)]
*  And just break it down one more [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7088.96s)]
*  level. [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7090.76s)]
*  He's basically saying Democrats [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7092.08s)]
*  should go with their most popular [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7093.84s)]
*  policies and [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7095.6s)]
*  not their least popular policies. [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7096.320000000001s)]
*  Wow, how revolutionary. [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7099.360000000001s)]
*  Of course, of course. [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7101.64s)]
*  Well, that's what Trump did. [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7103.400000000001s)]
*  Trump was like, I'll take the [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7104.68s)]
*  popular policies or, [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7107.78s)]
*  they were at range of popularity. [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7109.26s)]
*  But the ones that excite my base, [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7112.14s)]
*  but still have enough independence [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7113.820000000001s)]
*  that support it, right? [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7115.46s)]
*  Like on immigration. [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7116.5s)]
*  And then I'll dump all the [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7117.9800000000005s)]
*  unpopular policies that Republicans [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7119.1s)]
*  have and blame them for it. [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7120.66s)]
*  because they're unpopular because [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7122.02s)]
*  of those policies. [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7123.22s)]
*  To me, that is just [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7124.5s)]
*  elementary politics. [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7125.78s)]
*  So when you apply to Democrats, [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7127.7s)]
*  the problem with Democrats is that [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7129.22s)]
*  they never criticize each other. [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7130.54s)]
*  Because there's such a top down [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7132.06s)]
*  party these days. [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7133.58s)]
*  And they're like, okay, [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7135.02s)]
*  everybody follow leadership, okay? [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7135.88s)]
*  Right? [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7138.4s)]
*  Well, yeah, that you can't, [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7139.12s)]
*  I mean, but it's in a primary. [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7140.5199999999995s)]
*  If you're running in a Democratic [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7142.4s)]
*  primary for president, [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7144.04s)]
*  you have to criticize the other [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7145.4s)]
*  people in the race and [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7147.08s)]
*  say why you're better than them. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7148.2s)]
*  Again, elementary politics, but [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7150.5199999999995s)]
*  they beat that out of Bernie [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7152.44s)]
*  Sanders. [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7153.96s)]
*  And that's part of why he lost, [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7155.04s)]
*  because he wouldn't do that kind of [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7156.44s)]
*  elementary politics. [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7157.839999999999s)]
*  And then should you say, hey, [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7159.24s)]
*  I don't agree with the unpopular [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7161.12s)]
*  Democratic policies. [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7163.16s)]
*  If you don't agree, of course you [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7165.06s)]
*  should say it, because you should [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7166.5s)]
*  be honest, and it gets you an easy [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7168.1s)]
*  win in terms of the general voters, [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7169.94s)]
*  and also the Democratic voters. [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7172.1s)]
*  There's a lot of policies in the [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7174.0199999999995s)]
*  Democratic Party that Democratic [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7175.9s)]
*  voters, the majority of Democratic [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7177.86s)]
*  voters don't want. [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7179.84s)]
*  So if you can't speak out against [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7181.34s)]
*  that, then you're just not [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7183.0199999999995s)]
*  courageous enough to win. [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7184.5199999999995s)]
*  Yep. [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7186.0199999999995s)]
*  All right, and finally, [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7187.94s)]
*  David Sirota says, [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7189.14s)]
*  the candidate should attack [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7190.1s)]
*  the Democratic Party and [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7191.5s)]

*  And he calls this out saying it's [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7195.18s)]
*  amazing that a handful of us have [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7196.84s)]

*  I hate it so much. [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7205.26s)]
*  But yes, it's true. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7206.86s)]
*  The progressive wing of [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7208.94s)]

*  making this argument for a long [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7211.18s)]
*  time. [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7212.34s)]
*  The progressive wing of [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7213.14s)]
*  the Democratic Party has never [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7213.94s)]
*  taken seriously. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7215.14s)]
*  Because the corporate wing of [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7216.66s)]
*  the Democratic Party controls [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7217.82s)]

*  the establishment, the DNC. [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7220.1s)]
*  So look, do I think anyone's [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7222.46s)]

*  on, but other issues that they [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7232.76s)]

*  All right, back on Young Turks. [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7520.46s)]
*  Joining me now congressman Ro Khanna 개� [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7522.240000000001s)]
*  He's up to a lot of interesting things. [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7523.4s)]
*  He was trying to stop a war with Iran. [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7525.759999999999s)]
*  We're gonna ask for [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7527.839999999999s)]
*  the latest updates on that. [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7528.879999999999s)]
*  And then he put together a realistic [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7530.099999999999s)]
*  budget to cut $12 trillion. [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7533.24s)]
*  Now, I mean, if you're a populist, [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7537.12s)]
*  right, left, or center, [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7539.16s)]
*  you should love that plan. [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7540.5599999999995s)]
*  So we'll talk about it, and [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7542.16s)]
*  we'll see if you do love it or not. [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7543.799999999999s)]
*  Ro, first, let's talk about [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7546.4s)]
*  the War Powers Resolution Act. [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7547.839999999999s)]
*  So you had that resolution [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7549.799999999999s)]
*  co-sponsored with Tom Massey. [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7551.5s)]
*  Donald Trump attacked Tom Massey for [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7553.799999999999s)]
*  that, and called him a little boy, [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7556.2s)]
*  pathetic, and all these things. [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7558.48s)]
*  And so you lined up a bunch of [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7561.48s)]
*  Democratic sponsors. [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7563.24s)]
*  But now we're apparently in [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7564.36s)]
*  a ceasefire. [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7566.599999999999s)]
*  So does that mean that we're not [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7567.839999999999s)]
*  going to vote on that? [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7570.2s)]
*  And is there any scenario where we [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7573.0s)]
*  do vote on that resolution? [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7574.839999999999s)]
*  We still may vote on it. [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7577.28s)]
*  There's still opportunity to [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7578.44s)]
*  co-sponsor it. [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7579.48s)]
*  Look, Donald Trump has two people [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7580.16s)]
*  on his shoulders. [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7582.32s)]
*  One, the neo-Khan saying, [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7583.679999999999s)]
*  regime change, regime change. [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7585.4s)]
*  You gotta bomb Iran, [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7587.24s)]
*  the Lindsey Graham wing. [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7588.36s)]
*  And then he's got the MAGA base [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7589.799999999999s)]
*  that are Steve Bannon, [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7591.799999999999s)]
*  Tucker Carlson. [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7593.04s)]
*  We don't want any wars in Iran. [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7594.08s)]
*  Thomas Massey is up, but [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7596.36s)]
*  we don't want any more wars [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7597.36s)]
*  in the Middle East. [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7598.599999999999s)]
*  And we came together on this [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7599.759999999999s)]
*  War Powers Resolution. [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7601.44s)]
*  I do think everyone speaking out [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7602.759999999999s)]
*  in MAGA, people speaking out [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7605.2s)]
*  in progressive caucus, and [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7607.0s)]
*  around the country, [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7609.24s)]
*  the anti-war moments, as well as [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7610.0s)]
*  the War Powers Resolution, [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7611.88s)]
*  convinced Trump to abandon the idea [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7613.12s)]
*  of a regime change. [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7614.68s)]
*  He said, okay, [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7615.56s)]
*  I've done the bombing enough. [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7616.400000000001s)]
*  And the hope is that that sticks. [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7618.12s)]
*  But look, you already got Lindsey [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7621.12s)]
*  Graham saying it's not enough. [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7622.6s)]
*  You've already got Republicans [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7624.16s)]
*  saying, well, we may not have [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7625.72s)]
*  destroyed enough of [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7626.88s)]
*  the nuclear capability. [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7627.64s)]
*  So he's going to continually have [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7629.0s)]
*  this push to go back in. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7630.64s)]
*  And that's why we need to make [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7632.12s)]
*  sure that before he does anything [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7633.92s)]
*  further ever on Iran, [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7636.12s)]
*  he comes to Congress. [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7637.56s)]
*  Do you think that the MAGA [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7638.6s)]
*  rebellion against the war, [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7640.92s)]
*  the split that they had, did that [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7643.56s)]
*  make a little difference or [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7646.320000000001s)]
*  a lot of difference in your [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7648.320000000001s)]
*  opinion? [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7650.240000000001s)]
*  I think it made a significant [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7650.84s)]
*  difference. [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7652.320000000001s)]
*  I mean, I think that Donald Trump [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7652.92s)]
*  tweeted out that regime change may [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7654.96s)]
*  not be a bad thing. [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7657.0s)]
*  He have joked about it, but [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7658.08s)]
*  he was getting a lot of pressure [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7659.4400000000005s)]
*  saying just keep bombing, [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7661.04s)]
*  take him out. [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7662.52s)]
*  I'm sure Netanyahu was pushing him [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7663.280000000001s)]
*  in that direction. [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7665.04s)]
*  And I think he started to hear [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7666.08s)]
*  from people saying, look, [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7668.04s)]
*  you promised us no endless wars. [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7669.68s)]
*  And so he comes in and he says, [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7672.360000000001s)]
*  well, no American lives lost. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7673.52s)]
*  I just struck them. [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7674.68s)]
*  We're in the day, I'm done. [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7675.52s)]
*  I'm not up for endless wars. [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7677.56s)]
*  And like classic Trump, [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7678.96s)]
*  he kind of tries to have his foot [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7680.56s)]
*  in both camps. [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7682.84s)]
*  But the point is, [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7684.56s)]
*  I'm glad there are two camps. [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7685.6s)]
*  I mean, we've gone through [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7686.76s)]
*  presidencies where there are not [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7688.16s)]
*  two camps. [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7689.6s)]
*  And this is when people say, well, [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7690.320000000001s)]
*  did it make a difference? [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7691.88s)]
*  In politics, you never know what [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7693.24s)]
*  makes a difference, but I certainly [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7694.84s)]
*  think that if he's threatening [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7696.88s)]
*  Thomas Massey with long social [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7698.52s)]
*  media posts and $20 million, [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7700.08s)]
*  you got his attention, [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7701.88s)]
*  you got under his skin. [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7703.200000000001s)]
*  I can't, and he knows how to read [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7704.56s)]
*  the room, he knows popular sentiment [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7706.320000000001s)]
*  and he factored that in. [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7708.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it certainly seems that way. [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7710.84s)]
*  So if it comes back and [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7712.96s)]
*  the ceasefire somehow violated or [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7714.84s)]
*  Trump says go back into the war. [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7717.92s)]
*  And then this goes to a vote. [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7720.8s)]
*  It doesn't look like a lot of [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7724.0s)]
*  Republican politicians are going [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7725.4s)]
*  to support it though. [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7726.879999999999s)]
*  Because Massey's got no co-sponsors [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7727.5599999999995s)]
*  on his side last I checked, [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7730.12s)]
*  if I'm wrong about it. [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7731.839999999999s)]
*  One, Chuck Edwards, but yeah. [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7733.28s)]
*  Okay, Chuck Edwards. [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7735.24s)]
*  And how many co-sponsors did you [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7736.44s)]
*  get on your side? [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7738.28s)]
*  And do we think that most of [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7739.48s)]
*  Congress would actually vote for [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7741.08s)]
*  war if it came to a vote? [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7743.2s)]
*  So we've gotten 73 and counting. [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7744.879999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's been harder than I [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7748.96s)]
*  thought. [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7750.2s)]
*  I would think every Democrat would [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7750.719999999999s)]
*  get on this war power resolution, [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7752.16s)]
*  but it's been a harder push. [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7753.719999999999s)]
*  We have passed a war powers [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7755.16s)]
*  resolution as you know once before [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7756.44s)]
*  with Bernie Sanders and [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7758.0s)]
*  me to stop the war in Yemen. [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7759.08s)]
*  So it is possible, but it depends [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7760.599999999999s)]
*  on how egregious the action is and [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7763.2s)]
*  how much Republicans find [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7765.92s)]
*  their courage. [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7768.08s)]
*  I will say that the reason Donald [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7768.96s)]
*  Trump targeted Massey is that we [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7770.599999999999s)]
*  were talking to at least 10 [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7772.24s)]
*  different Republicans who were [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7773.5599999999995s)]
*  seriously considering getting on [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7775.12s)]
*  if the war had continued. [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7776.96s)]
*  And I think he wanted to have [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7778.68s)]
*  a chilling effect saying don't [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7779.76s)]
*  even think about this unless you [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7781.04s)]
*  want my political team coming [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7782.36s)]
*  after you. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7784.0s)]
*  Yeah, so and of course the [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7785.84s)]
*  politicians inside Congress are [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7787.5599999999995s)]
*  very different than Trump and [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7789.72s)]
*  MAGA and progressives. [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7791.68s)]
*  So the voters are very different [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7793.639999999999s)]
*  than the folks in Congress. [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7795.88s)]
*  And I mean, look. [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7798.5199999999995s)]
*  That may be the most profound [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7800.2s)]
*  statement you've made ever. [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7801.84s)]
*  That is the fundamental disconnect. [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7803.5599999999995s)]
*  The voters, the base of people are [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7806.5199999999995s)]
*  so different than the people who [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7808.28s)]
*  are actually elected. [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7809.96s)]
*  It's sad, but it's true. [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7811.16s)]
*  It's a disconnect. [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7812.28s)]
*  It's what allowed for [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7813.04s)]
*  Donald Trump to become president. [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7814.4s)]
*  It's what allowed Bernie Sanders [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7815.6s)]
*  to become this phenomena because [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7817.5199999999995s)]
*  they had the guts actually to go [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7819.36s)]
*  out and say, look, [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7821.16s)]
*  the establishment isn't working. [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7822.32s)]
*  Yeah, man, look, [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7825.16s)]
*  I hope he doesn't come back up. [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7826.5199999999995s)]
*  I hope the ceasefire holds that we [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7829.12s)]
*  never bomb Iran again. [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7830.88s)]
*  They never hit us again. [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7832.12s)]
*  None of that happens, and etc. [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7833.32s)]
*  But I would be curious if it did [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7836.0s)]
*  come back and you guys had that [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7838.32s)]
*  vote, because APEC's in the [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7840.8s)]
*  And so let me just ask you last [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7843.719999999999s)]
*  question on that. [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7845.639999999999s)]
*  How much of an effect do you think [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7847.2s)]
*  APEC would have on a vote like [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7848.719999999999s)]
*  that? [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7850.08s)]
*  It'll have an impact obviously, [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7851.0s)]
*  but people ascribe all the blame [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7853.599999999999s)]
*  to APEC, but it's a whole coalition. [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7856.24s)]
*  You've got the National Security [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7860.04s)]
*  Hawks, you've got the Defense Hawks, [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7861.639999999999s)]
*  you've got, of course, APEC on that. [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7863.5599999999995s)]
*  And they all are this foreign [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7866.2s)]
*  policy blob where you get painted [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7868.719999999999s)]
*  a week on national security, [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7871.72s)]
*  week on American security, and [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7873.8s)]
*  that has an impact. [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7876.04s)]
*  Yeah, defense contractors that [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7877.64s)]
*  would make billions from the wars, [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7879.200000000001s)]
*  etc. [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7880.96s)]
*  So okay, let's talk about saving [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7881.84s)]
*  money instead of spending money. [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7883.4800000000005s)]
*  So Donald Trump and [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7885.240000000001s)]
*  Elon Musk talked a big game, Doge, [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7886.72s)]
*  and we're going to cut two trillion [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7889.16s)]
*  from the budget and all this stuff. [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7891.240000000001s)]
*  And then we didn't get very many [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7893.400000000001s)]
*  cuts, a lot of the cuts on Doge [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7895.08s)]
*  were disputed to begin with. [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7896.6s)]
*  But even if they were all true, [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7898.16s)]
*  it's kind of a drop in the bucket [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7899.96s)]
*  after they're going to add three to [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7902.04s)]
*  5 trillion with this tax cut into [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7904.36s)]
*  the budget. [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7906.6s)]
*  So and they added to the Pentagon, [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7907.68s)]
*  so they got no savings at all. [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7909.24s)]
*  They're going in the opposite [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7910.84s)]
*  direction, Trump was obviously [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7912.4400000000005s)]
*  empirically full of crap on cutting [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7914.4400000000005s)]
*  from the budget he's adding to [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7916.52s)]
*  the deficit and the debt, right? [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7918.24s)]
*  So but how in the world are you [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7920.4400000000005s)]
*  proposing to save $12 trillion if [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7922.92s)]
*  you do it with left-wing tax cuts? [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7925.88s)]
*  Left-wing populists. [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7929.48s)]
*  Well, let's look at the basic map. [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7930.96s)]
*  So we're at $36 trillion in debt. [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7933.32s)]
*  Over the next 10 years, [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7936.0s)]
*  we've got basically $2 trillion [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7937.48s)]
*  deficits, if you just keep [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7939.5199999999995s)]
*  the status quo, that's about $20 [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7941.32s)]
*  trillion over 10 years. [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7943.48s)]
*  The Republican budget would add to [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7945.4s)]
*  that, so their budgets would have [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7947.5599999999995s)]
*  $24 trillion added. [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7949.76s)]
*  And what ours would do is save [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7951.5199999999995s)]
*  $12 trillion. [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7953.16s)]
*  So you're still running a small [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7954.16s)]
*  deficit, but instead of having [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7956.24s)]
*  $12 trillion more of deficits or [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7958.24s)]
*  10 years, now you're having about [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7960.16s)]
*  $7 to $8 trillion of deficit. [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7962.4s)]
*  So how do we save the $12 trillion? [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7964.96s)]
*  It's pretty simple, you tax the [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7967.0s)]
*  billionaires and [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7969.44s)]
*  multimillionaires more. [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7970.679999999999s)]
*  You have us tax on stock buybacks [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7973.5599999999995s)]
*  and make sure that people when [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7975.36s)]
*  they're getting an inheritance are [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7976.96s)]
*  actually paying the capital gains [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7978.8s)]
*  tax. [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7980.5599999999995s)]
*  But you also cut spending, [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7981.08s)]
*  you cut the defense contractors. [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7982.4s)]
*  You don't have a Pentagon budget [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7984.32s)]
*  over a trillion dollars. [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7985.76s)]
*  You cut the fraud from Medicare [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7986.88s)]
*  Advantage, which everyone [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7988.4400000000005s)]
*  acknowledges that they're upbilling [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7989.92s)]
*  and ripping off the American [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7991.88s)]
*  taxpayers by making it seem that [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7993.360000000001s)]
*  people are sicker than they are. [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7995.08s)]
*  You cut the fossil fuel subsidies, [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=7997.08s)]
*  you cut funding when it comes to [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8000.12s)]
*  waste in procurement because we [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8002.64s)]
*  don't have a competitive process. [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8005.16s)]
*  And with that, and then you [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8007.96s)]
*  negotiate for prescription drugs [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8009.56s)]
*  to bring the cost of prescription [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8011.76s)]
*  drugs down. [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8013.84s)]
*  With that, you can save about [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8014.88s)]
*  $12 billion. [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8016.2s)]
*  We've put it out there. [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8016.8s)]
*  I guarantee you there's going to be [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8018.8s)]
*  something you don't like in [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8020.32s)]
*  the budget, either some tax you [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8021.48s)]
*  disagree with or some spending cut [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8023.08s)]
*  you disagree with. [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8024.88s)]
*  But it's an honest budget. [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8026.32s)]
*  And I think at this point, [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8028.16s)]
*  why don't we actually have every [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8029.76s)]
*  member of Congress offer an honest [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8031.68s)]
*  budget of where they're going to [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8033.84s)]
*  get savings instead of having [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8035.84s)]
*  a magical view that we're going to [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8037.88s)]
*  have 3 or 4% growth and basically [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8040.24s)]
*  lying to the American people and [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8042.92s)]
*  lying to the American people. [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8045.52s)]
*  Yeah, so let me probe into [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8047.240000000001s)]
*  a couple of those. [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8048.56s)]
*  So on the corporate tax increases, [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8049.280000000001s)]
*  they're pretty modest actually. [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8051.84s)]
*  You'd be bringing them to 28%, [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8053.8s)]
*  which is still lower than where [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8056.240000000001s)]
*  they were pre-Trump in 2015. [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8058.360000000001s)]
*  So okay, so [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8061.320000000001s)]
*  that's certainly not radical. [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8061.84s)]
*  It's very normal. [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8063.200000000001s)]
*  How about the tax on the wealthy? [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8065.52s)]
*  What do you mean by that? [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8069.040000000001s)]
*  How would that go up? [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8070.4400000000005s)]
*  Well, if you're over $100 million, [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8072.040000000001s)]
*  you would get 1 to 2% of your [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8073.84s)]
*  assets taxed every year. [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8076.24s)]
*  And you're making at least 7, [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8078.68s)]
*  8% on returns is just if you put [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8081.04s)]
*  the money in a mutual fund, [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8083.4800000000005s)]
*  probably much more. [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8085.4800000000005s)]
*  But you pay 1 to 2% on that. [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8087.4400000000005s)]
*  And the reality is most of those [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8089.4400000000005s)]
*  folks are not paying tax. [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8091.4400000000005s)]
*  They're just letting their money [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8093.400000000001s)]
*  continue to appreciate. [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8095.84s)]
*  I mean, they're not paying tax [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8098.64s)]
*  until realization. [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8099.68s)]
*  Yeah, so it's a tough issue [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8101.72s)]
*  because they avoid a lot of [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8104.2s)]
*  the taxes by just taking out loans. [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8107.16s)]
*  Right. [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8111.280000000001s)]
*  Based on the amount of shares they [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8111.8s)]
*  have in different stock. [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8113.76s)]
*  And it'll be interesting to see how [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8115.88s)]
*  you can put an end to that. [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8117.240000000001s)]
*  But it applies to only people [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8118.08s)]
*  making above or [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8119.4400000000005s)]
*  that have above $100 million in [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8120.4400000000005s)]
*  wealth. [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8122.320000000001s)]
*  And it's not taxing [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8122.88s)]
*  unappreciated capital gains. [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8124.0s)]
*  So one, if you can tax the loans [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8125.72s)]
*  as a realization of an event, [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8127.76s)]
*  let's say you're worth $1 billion. [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8129.919999999999s)]
*  Now you go up to $2 billion. [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8131.919999999999s)]
*  If you were to tax unrealized [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8134.48s)]
*  capital gains at 20 some percent, [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8136.04s)]
*  they unrealized gains would be [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8137.719999999999s)]
*  $1 billion. [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8139.12s)]
*  That person would be paying $200 [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8140.12s)]
*  million in tax. [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8141.679999999999s)]
*  But if you're just saying we're [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8143.16s)]
*  going to pay 1% of $2 billion, [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8144.599999999999s)]
*  you're paying $20 million in tax. [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8146.12s)]
*  So this is not saying that [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8148.32s)]
*  unrealized gains are being taxed. [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8149.919999999999s)]
*  This is just like a property tax. [[02:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8152.04s)]
*  You're a state includes not just [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8153.36s)]
*  your property, but your net assets. [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8155.44s)]
*  And I think it's a much easier [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8157.88s)]
*  sell than taxing the unrealized [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8159.92s)]
*  capital gains. [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8162.08s)]
*  That's really interesting. [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8164.04s)]
*  Okay, so now we go to the ones that [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8164.88s)]
*  I think are kind of relatively easy. [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8166.8s)]
*  And what I really want to ask is, [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8168.92s)]
*  since they have overwhelming [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8171.04s)]
*  popularity, I mean, all these three [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8173.64s)]
*  that I'm going to list are probably [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8175.84s)]
*  above 80%. [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8177.28s)]
*  So the real way that they get [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8178.400000000001s)]
*  stopped is through your colleagues. [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8180.4400000000005s)]
*  So let's start with one of them, [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8183.32s)]
*  ending the fossil fuel subsidies. [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8184.6s)]
*  So your estimation is that it's [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8186.96s)]
*  about $17 billion a year, right? [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8188.88s)]
*  So we save $170 billion. [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8191.4800000000005s)]
*  So, okay, if you put that up for [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8194.48s)]
*  a vote and all of the American [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8196.960000000001s)]
*  people were paying attention, [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8199.24s)]
*  it might be unanimous. [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8201.72s)]
*  And why would we give the richest [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8203.68s)]
*  companies in the world extra money [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8205.6s)]
*  from the average American who [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8207.68s)]
*  could barely afford it? [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8209.32s)]
*  Especially that they're not [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8210.960000000001s)]
*  a nascent industry, [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8212.4s)]
*  they're a very mature industry, [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8213.36s)]
*  etc. [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8214.960000000001s)]
*  So why doesn't it ever go up for [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8215.64s)]
*  a vote? [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8218.16s)]
*  Why can't we end these preposterous [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8218.84s)]
*  subsidies that no one other than [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8221.439999999999s)]
*  oil executives want? [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8223.72s)]
*  Well, because it's the oil lobby, [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8225.96s)]
*  the big oil and [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8228.76s)]
*  gas companies have huge lobbies. [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8229.96s)]
*  They give a lot of money to take [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8233.599999999999s)]
*  the members of Congress. [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8235.16s)]
*  They have PACs and [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8236.68s)]
*  they paint you as, [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8237.599999999999s)]
*  if you're opposed to fossil fuel [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8238.84s)]
*  subsidies, you're opposed to, [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8240.56s)]
*  are you opposed to natural gas? [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8242.199999999999s)]
*  Are you opposed to oil? [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8243.76s)]
*  No, we're not opposed to it. [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8245.0s)]
*  It's just you've had these [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8246.24s)]
*  subsidies since 1916. [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8247.88s)]
*  Maybe it's time that we move on. [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8249.519999999999s)]
*  I mean, imagine if we still had [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8252.039999999999s)]
*  to have solar subsidies in [[02:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8254.039999999999s)]
*  the year 2100. [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8255.8s)]
*  The absurdity of it is we have [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8257.08s)]
*  a tilted playing field in this [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8259.16s)]

*  the advantage of oil and [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8270.56s)]
*  traditional fossil fuels. [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8271.919999999998s)]
*  And all I'm saying is don't give [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8274.199999999999s)]
*  them an advantage. [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8276.08s)]
*  No one is saying, okay, [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8276.96s)]
*  don't let them do business until [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8278.64s)]
*  there's a transition away. [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8281.039999999999s)]
*  Just don't give them a taxpayer [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8283.039999999999s)]
*  advantage. [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8285.64s)]
*  Yeah, look, I'm living over [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8287.84s)]
*  the $4 billion we send to Israel [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8289.279999999999s)]
*  every year. [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8291.039999999999s)]
*  But $17 billion is more than 4X [[02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8292.119999999999s)]
*  that and it's every single year [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8295.24s)]
*  for almost now. [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8297.84s)]
*  I mean, it wasn't $17 billion back [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8299.4s)]
*  in the day, but [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8300.84s)]
*  these subsidies have been going on [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8301.359999999999s)]
*  as you point out for over 100 years. [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8302.8s)]
*  So it's just criminal. [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8306.48s)]
*  But Ro, to ask you a tough question [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8309.0s)]
*  here, when the Democrats are in [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8310.92s)]

*  either. [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8314.4s)]

*  Democratic colleagues also take [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8317.0s)]
*  fossil fuel money and [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8319.119999999999s)]
*  that's why we never get a vote on [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8320.32s)]
*  this? [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8322.24s)]
*  Well, I pushed very hard and [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8324.119999999999s)]
*  the Chair of the Environment [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8325.199999999999s)]
*  Committee to get a vote on this. [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8326.199999999999s)]
*  I pushed to get it in the Inflation [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8327.32s)]
*  Reduction Act. [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8329.24s)]
*  I pushed to get it in the American [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8330.56s)]
*  basket plan, I kept getting shut [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8331.92s)]
*  down. [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8333.16s)]
*  And the reason is, some of it is [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8333.92s)]
*  oil and gas money, some of it is [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8336.16s)]
*  a perception that Democrats don't [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8337.84s)]
*  want to get repainted as anti-oil [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8340.08s)]
*  and gas. [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8343.08s)]
*  But I don't think even someone [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8343.960000000001s)]
*  working in the oil and gas [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8345.24s)]
*  industry will object if you say, [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8346.4s)]
*  I don't want to subsidize your [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8347.8s)]
*  industry, which is going not to [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8349.52s)]
*  you, it's going to the executives. [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8352.2s)]
*  I mean, if there was some subsidy [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8353.88s)]
*  for tech companies, even though I [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8355.52s)]
*  represent Silicon Valley, [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8357.72s)]
*  I'd say that's crazy. [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8358.88s)]
*  You don't need to subsidize [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8359.68s)]
*  the corporations and the executives. [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8361.400000000001s)]
*  So I just think we have to have [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8363.04s)]
*  more principle in being willing to [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8365.400000000001s)]
*  stand up for what's right. [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8369.36s)]
*  So I want to understand how these [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8371.480000000001s)]
*  lobbies actually get things done. [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8374.28s)]
*  because another one of your [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8376.12s)]
*  proposals is Medicare Advantage. [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8376.800000000001s)]
*  For those who don't know, [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8378.44s)]
*  it's set up in the wrong way. [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8382.08s)]
*  So it's incentivizes giant scam. [[02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8383.36s)]
*  And some of you might be familiar [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8386.32s)]
*  with it because you get a call [[02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8388.36s)]
*  saying, we're your insurance [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8389.880000000001s)]
*  company, and we'd like to send [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8391.24s)]
*  a nurse over, right? [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8392.52s)]
*  And so what a wonderful thing, [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8393.88s)]
*  right? [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8395.6s)]
*  No, the nurse is going to pretend [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8396.199999999999s)]
*  that you have a lot of ailments [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8398.08s)]
*  that you don't have and [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8399.68s)]
*  charge the American government and [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8401.24s)]
*  totally and utterly rob us. [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8403.32s)]
*  And they robbed us of at least, [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8405.28s)]
*  what, 100 billion a year? [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8406.96s)]
*  I don't know, it's just a monster, [[02:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8408.84s)]
*  monster number. [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8410.24s)]
*  You would know better than I would. [[02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8411.08s)]
*  But so the only people who are in [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8413.24s)]
*  favor of that is the health [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8414.96s)]
*  insurance companies, because it's [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8416.44s)]
*  nothing but a robbery, right? [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8418.6s)]
*  So again, if you go to propose [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8420.28s)]
*  this and to vote on it, [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8422.68s)]
*  there is no excuse for it. [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8424.560000000001s)]
*  So do Democrats or [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8427.92s)]
*  Republicans just say, [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8428.960000000001s)]
*  what do they say internally? [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8430.320000000002s)]
*  Do they say like, yeah, well, [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8432.28s)]
*  obviously I'm a crook and [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8433.400000000001s)]
*  I'm taking money from these guys? [[02:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8434.36s)]
*  Or what's their excuse here? [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8436.12s)]
*  Well, the dirty secret in [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8437.720000000001s)]
*  Washington is it's not how people [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8439.04s)]
*  vote, it's what comes up for a vote. [[02:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8440.880000000001s)]
*  So the way the lobbyists work is [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8443.12s)]
*  they don't allow it to come for [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8444.560000000001s)]
*  a vote. [[02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8445.880000000001s)]
*  They'll make sure that it's not [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8446.52s)]
*  part of these big bills. [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8448.6s)]
*  They'll make sure that it doesn't [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8450.16s)]
*  advance through committee. [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8451.88s)]
*  And you can't blame someone, [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8453.119999999999s)]
*  it just becomes amorphous. [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8454.64s)]
*  Well, the leadership didn't want [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8456.08s)]
*  it. [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8457.88s)]
*  Well, who's the leadership? [[02:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8458.4s)]
*  Well, is it a committee chair? [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8459.039999999999s)]
*  Is it the speaker? [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8460.56s)]
*  Is it the House Majority Leader? [[02:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8461.8s)]
*  Is it some caucus? [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8464.16s)]
*  It just wasn't included. [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8465.48s)]
*  We didn't have the votes, so [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8466.4s)]
*  we aren't going to include it. [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8467.92s)]
*  So this way, no single individual [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8469.08s)]
*  has to take blame. [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8471.32s)]
*  No one ends up going on the record [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8472.72s)]
*  and no change is made. [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8474.96s)]
*  And 90% of things where American [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8476.56s)]
*  people are like, [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8478.960000000001s)]
*  why can't we get that done? [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8480.08s)]
*  The reason we can't get it done is [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8481.960000000001s)]
*  because it doesn't come up for [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8483.6s)]
*  a vote. [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8484.960000000001s)]
*  It's not even that people are [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8485.48s)]
*  voting against it. [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8486.92s)]
*  It's just that they don't want it [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8487.960000000001s)]
*  to come up for a vote. [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8489.48s)]
*  So, Ro, I have a theory and [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8490.6s)]
*  I want to bounce it over you here [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8491.960000000001s)]
*  because I think that a lot of this [[02:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8493.84s)]
*  stuff gets solved if you just find [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8496.0s)]
*  a way and this is not an easy thing [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8498.32s)]
*  to do. [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8500.76s)]
*  But if you find a way to put [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8501.84s)]
*  a national spotlight on it. [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8503.6s)]
*  And so look, if we had [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8505.76s)]
*  a progressive president, [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8506.84s)]
*  then it gets infinitely easier [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8508.240000000002s)]
*  because they could just use [[02:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8510.240000000002s)]
*  the bully pulpit and go one by one [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8511.92s)]
*  on these issues. [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8514.0s)]
*  But like, whenever Trump wants to [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8515.640000000001s)]
*  put a spotlight on something, [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8518.240000000002s)]
*  he puts a massive, [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8520.560000000001s)]
*  massive spotlight on it. [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8521.960000000001s)]
*  If you put a spotlight on any one [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8524.240000000002s)]
*  of these subsidies and scams and [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8526.08s)]
*  actual waste, fraud and abuse, [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8528.04s)]
*  the American people would hate it. [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8530.04s)]
*  And then they, so is it possible [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8532.400000000001s)]
*  that that kind of public pressure [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8534.640000000001s)]
*  and just being able to highlight [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8537.72s)]
*  it so that there's a national [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8539.4s)]
*  conversation around it, [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8540.8s)]
*  could actually make a difference [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8542.44s)]
*  in getting it passed? [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8543.76s)]
*  I think it's incredibly important. [[02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8546.08s)]
*  It's 60% of the game. [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8548.76s)]
*  It's something we didn't do enough [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8549.96s)]
*  up in the last presidency [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8551.24s)]
*  that was Biden. [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8552.88s)]
*  But I think it's 60% because Trump [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8553.84s)]
*  lacks something that is also needed, [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8556.48s)]
*  which is follow through. [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8558.72s)]
*  So Trump did put a huge bully pulpit [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8559.8s)]
*  on big format ripping off Americans [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8561.52s)]
*  and they're charging Americans more [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8564.16s)]
*  than any other country. [[02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8566.16s)]
*  He said, no, that's got to stop. [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8567.16s)]
*  You can't charge Americans more for [[02:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8568.96s)]
*  your drugs than you are in other [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8570.6s)]
*  industrialized countries. [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8572.24s)]
*  I get if you want to charge people [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8573.36s)]
*  in Africa less, but [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8574.52s)]
*  not people in Japan less. [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8575.36s)]
*  I introduced that executive order [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8577.24s)]
*  as legislation in Congress. [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8579.56s)]
*  And we had a couple of Republicans [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8581.4s)]
*  co-sponsored and [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8582.84s)]
*  since then it's just languished. [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8583.56s)]
*  Now what it would require is not [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8585.08s)]
*  just a president signing [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8586.72s)]
*  that executive order, [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8587.68s)]
*  it would require Trump would food [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8588.52s)]
*  social every other day saying, [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8589.68s)]
*  I want that legislation to pass. [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8591.8s)]
*  I want the spotlight not just to be [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8594.240000000002s)]
*  there, but I want to translate that [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8596.28s)]
*  spotlight into legislation. [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8598.44s)]
*  And that's where you have these [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8600.68s)]
*  great presidents like Lyndon Johnson [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8602.08s)]
*  who don't just highlight it, but [[02:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8603.880000000001s)]
*  then work every legislator to [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8605.480000000001s)]
*  actually get their things done. [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8607.0s)]
*  Biden had some of the skill of [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8609.6s)]
*  getting legislation through, [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8610.880000000001s)]
*  he didn't have the spotlight. [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8612.16s)]
*  Trump has some of the skill of [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8613.52s)]
*  spotlight, but he doesn't care a [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8614.720000000001s)]
*  lot about the details of [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8616.16s)]
*  the legislation. [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8617.12s)]
*  And so that languishes as well. [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8618.36s)]
*  Well, and of course, [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8620.800000000001s)]
*  there's one other thing with Trump, [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8621.6s)]
*  which is that he doesn't actually [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8622.96s)]
*  want to do it. [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8624.24s)]
*  He just, he wants to get the credit [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8624.759999999998s)]
*  for the marketing like, [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8626.599999999999s)]
*  I'm going to lower my debt, right? [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8627.839999999998s)]
*  And you're like, okay, well, [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8630.24s)]
*  Roe turned it into a bill with [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8631.199999999999s)]
*  a couple of Republicans, [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8632.279999999999s)]
*  why don't you back that? [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8633.24s)]
*  No, he's busy backing the giant tax [[02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8634.4s)]
*  cut for the rich. [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8636.32s)]
*  So that's where his priorities are. [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8637.679999999998s)]
*  But actually tonight, coincidentally, [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8639.24s)]
*  we didn't know you were going to be [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8641.039999999999s)]
*  on tonight. [[02:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8642.4s)]
*  But we have an Operation Hope [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8643.199999999999s)]
*  meeting right after this interview, [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8644.759999999998s)]
*  and people can sign up at [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8646.599999999999s)]
*  tyt.com slash hope. [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8647.919999999998s)]
*  And our volunteers decided that [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8649.48s)]
*  they're going to try to back your [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8651.44s)]
*  House Resolution 3493 to lower [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8653.359999999999s)]
*  drug prices. [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8655.44s)]
*  Fantastic, I appreciate that. [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8656.8s)]
*  That'd be a big help. [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8658.52s)]
*  You know, half the challenge in [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8659.56s)]
*  these things is just getting [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8660.92s)]
*  Democrats on board with it and [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8662.119999999999s)]
*  Republicans. [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8663.6s)]
*  But it's so frustrating to me how [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8664.6s)]
*  many of some of these issues we [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8666.24s)]
*  don't even have consensus within [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8667.72s)]
*  the Democratic Party. [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8669.359999999999s)]
*  Like our party should be against [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8670.68s)]
*  fossil fuel spending. [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8672.24s)]
*  Our party should be against big [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8673.16s)]
*  pharma ripping off Americans. [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8674.6s)]
*  Our party should be against huge [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8676.199999999999s)]
*  defense contractors making record [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8677.72s)]
*  profits. [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8679.44s)]
*  Our party should be willing to [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8680.0s)]
*  tax the Elk or rich more. [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8681.32s)]
*  And yet on all these things that I [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8683.0s)]
*  mentioned, you probably would have [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8684.56s)]
*  to be hard pressed to get a [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8686.36s)]
*  majority of the Democratic caucus [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8687.56s)]
*  still on board. [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8689.119999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so first of all, [[02:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8690.88s)]
*  I didn't realize they called it [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8692.36s)]
*  Connacare. [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8694.36s)]
*  I love that Operation Hope did that. [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8695.16s)]
*  But look, so it rose right, [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8699.039999999999s)]
*  first of all, [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8700.76s)]
*  when it comes to the Democrats, [[02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8701.76s)]
*  do you want lower drug? [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8704.039999999999s)]
*  I mean, literally every Democrat [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8705.72s)]
*  has said they want lower drug [[02:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8707.44s)]
*  prices. [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8709.08s)]
*  So this puts them to the test. [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8709.64s)]
*  There's no reason to say no to [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8710.92s)]
*  this, none, right? [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8713.199999999999s)]
*  This is Democratic agenda 101. [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8714.72s)]
*  And to Rose's point about [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8718.32s)]
*  the Republicans, well, [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8719.359999999999s)]
*  it wasn't Trump executive order. [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8720.759999999998s)]
*  So are you pro Trump or [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8722.92s)]
*  anti Trump, right? [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8724.72s)]
*  And so, and why it's kind of genius [[02:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8726.64s)]
*  and why the Operation Hope guys [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8730.92s)]
*  are focused on it is because we [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8733.72s)]
*  don't think Trump really meant it. [[02:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8736.759999999998s)]
*  And so it's kind of calling his [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8740.56s)]
*  bluff. [[02:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8742.24s)]
*  And so, and that's a smart way to [[02:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8742.759999999998s)]
*  go and say, okay, [[02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8745.759999999998s)]
*  if you meant lower drug prices, [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8747.48s)]
*  deal, we'll take yes for an answer. [[02:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8750.08s)]
*  So, last thing on this, [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8753.24s)]
*  you've been doing a lot of media, [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8754.679999999998s)]
*  which is smart, Nets, [[02:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8756.679999999998s)]
*  you got to get your message out. [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8758.039999999999s)]
*  And you've been challenging [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8759.679999999998s)]
*  leadership a little bit too, [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8761.679999999998s)]
*  including a challenge of Chuck [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8763.759999999998s)]
*  Schumer on an issue, etc. [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8765.96s)]
*  What's been the responses? [[02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8768.8s)]
*  Mainstream media a little bit more [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8770.68s)]
*  open to what you're saying here [[02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8772.2s)]
*  because if any of these things got [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8773.64s)]
*  national attention, again, [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8775.16s)]
*  they're all not based on, I like [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8776.76s)]
*  them, but based on national polling, [[02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8778.76s)]
*  enormously popular initiatives. [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8781.0s)]
*  Well, I appreciate it. [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8784.56s)]
*  I feel like I've been doing double [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8785.36s)]
*  media because I do it and [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8786.880000000001s)]
*  then I see you mentioned one of my [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8788.0s)]
*  policy proposals on all the [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8789.52s)]
*  podcasts you're doing and [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8790.84s)]
*  all the shows you're doing. [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8791.92s)]
*  So I appreciate that we're getting [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8792.84s)]
*  this out there. [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8794.8s)]
*  But you know what I found in [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8795.72s)]
*  candor is that I'm always as [[02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8796.96s)]
*  straight. [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8798.919999999998s)]
*  Initially, I was a little more [[02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8799.759999999998s)]
*  diplomatic and I say, [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8801.72s)]
*  here's what I believe and [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8803.08s)]
*  I wouldn't really call out Chuck [[02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8804.599999999999s)]
*  Schumer who spent a week trying to [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8806.759999999998s)]
*  equivocate and not getting my war [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8809.039999999999s)]
*  powers resolution or [[02:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8811.48s)]
*  Keynes war powers resolution on [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8812.8s)]
*  the floor. [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8815.039999999999s)]
*  And then I realized that if you [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8815.759999999998s)]
*  actually just tell the truth and [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8817.439999999999s)]
*  say these leaders are actually not [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8819.32s)]
*  moving it and [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8821.359999999999s)]
*  you're willing to call them out. [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8822.199999999999s)]
*  Suddenly people's ears perk up and [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8824.16s)]
*  they're like, okay, [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8826.84s)]
*  this guy has got the honesty to [[02:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8828.279999999999s)]
*  call out his own party. [[02:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8830.32s)]
*  Maybe he's one of the more honest [[02:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8831.8s)]
*  ones, let me hear what he has to [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8833.72s)]
*  say. [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8835.76s)]
*  And so now I feel I've lost any [[02:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8836.32s)]
*  inhibition and if there's someone [[02:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8838.0s)]
*  from our own party who's standing [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8840.0s)]
*  in the way, I just say it as I see [[02:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8841.84s)]
*  it. [[02:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8843.68s)]
*  I never engage in personal attacks. [[02:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8844.199999999999s)]
*  I never would say someone is [[02:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8846.119999999999s)]
*  corrupt unless there's really [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8847.68s)]
*  a corruption or [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8849.44s)]
*  someone has a scandal. [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8850.44s)]
*  I just say the facts, and [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8851.92s)]
*  I think that that's really [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8853.199999999999s)]
*  important people. [[02:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8854.64s)]
*  You start to build credibility when [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8855.92s)]
*  you're willing to call out people [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8858.0s)]
*  in the status quo. [[02:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8860.0s)]
*  Yeah, I totally agree. [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8861.72s)]
*  Okay, and then lastly, [[02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8862.92s)]
*  Zoran Mamdani just won [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8864.56s)]
*  the Democratic primary for [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8865.92s)]
*  the New York Mayor's race. [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8867.679999999998s)]
*  I mean, I don't know if you can [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8869.439999999999s)]
*  tell, that was good. [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8872.08s)]
*  So look, the last post I had on X [[02:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8874.0s)]
*  was one of the results of this is [[02:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8878.039999999999s)]
*  that if AOC enters the New York [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8881.72s)]
*  Senate race, Chuck Schumer is [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8885.2s)]
*  going to drop out instantly. [[02:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8886.96s)]
*  I mean, nobody wants to go out like [[02:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8888.52s)]
*  Andrew Cuomo did. [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8891.039999999999s)]
*  So what's your sense of that [[02:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8892.36s)]
*  Senate race? [[02:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8894.92s)]
*  If AOC gets in, do we think that [[02:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8897.08s)]
*  Chuck Schumer probably says, [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8899.2s)]
*  it's been a good career. [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8901.32s)]
*  I appreciate everybody and [[02:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8902.84s)]
*  maybe steps down. [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8904.76s)]
*  I mean, if he has any political [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8906.68s)]
*  sense, that's what he would do. [[02:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8908.119999999999s)]
*  I mean, this is, [[02:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8909.76s)]
*  look, the New York Senate [[02:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8910.72s)]
*  seems a big deal. [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8912.2s)]
*  It's a seat that Robert Kennedy had, [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8913.52s)]
*  Hillary Clinton had. [[02:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8915.76s)]
*  It's a huge thing. [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8917.32s)]
*  And that's partly why Schumer [[02:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8919.04s)]
*  clings to it. [[02:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8920.800000000001s)]
*  But I mean, it's amazing to me, [[02:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8921.52s)]
*  with Zoran's victory, [[02:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8923.720000000001s)]
*  how clear a path AOC has now to [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8925.4s)]
*  winning it. [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8927.44s)]
*  And I think if you're Chuck Schumer [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8928.44s)]
*  or you're one of the other people [[02:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8930.92s)]
*  and you have any political sense, [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8933.16s)]
*  you would see that. [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8935.4s)]
*  Why you'd want to lose is, [[02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8936.52s)]
*  you can't explain human emotion. [[02:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8938.68s)]
*  But I think it's becoming more and [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8941.44s)]
*  more obvious. [[02:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8943.960000000001s)]
*  And I think it probably gives [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8945.0s)]
*  progressives the courage to run. [[02:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8946.92s)]
*  Because the argument always used to [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8949.28s)]
*  be, well, okay, [[02:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8951.24s)]
*  AOC is up in the polls, but [[02:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8952.220000000001s)]
*  they're going to dump $20 million. [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8953.68s)]
*  And they're going to change [[02:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8955.92s)]
*  the numbers. [[02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8957.12s)]
*  Well, they just tried that against [[02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8957.92s)]
*  Zoran, it didn't work. [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8959.36s)]
*  If anything, it backfired. [[02:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8960.44s)]
*  Yeah, they spent $25 million on [[02:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8962.720000000001s)]
*  a mayor's race and [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8964.2s)]
*  couldn't get the job done. [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8965.08s)]
*  In fact, yeah, his numbers went up, [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8966.800000000001s)]
*  not down. [[02:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8968.640000000001s)]
*  So last thing to put a button on [[02:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8969.560000000001s)]
*  that. [[02:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8972.04s)]
*  So if AOC runs in that Senate [[02:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8972.560000000001s)]
*  primary and Chuck Schumer stays in [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8974.960000000001s)]
*  the race, you think AOC wins? [[02:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8978.08s)]
*  I think she wins. [[02:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8981.720000000001s)]
*  I think she wins decisively. [[02:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8982.44s)]
*  And I think she gets support to do [[02:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8984.08s)]
*  that. [[02:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8986.84s)]
*  And my sense is, look, if we don't [[02:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8988.52s)]
*  win back the Senate, [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8990.52s)]
*  I would not be surprised if you [[02:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8991.880000000001s)]
*  have other people say, look, [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8993.800000000001s)]
*  I'm going to be leader of the [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8995.640000000001s)]
*  Democratic Party in the Senate. [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8997.04s)]
*  And frankly, it would be shocking [[02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=8999.32s)]
*  to me if others didn't step up to [[02:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=9001.08s)]
*  do that. [[02:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=9002.68s)]
*  I mean, part of the problem, [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=9003.2s)]
*  I think, has been that the old [[02:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=9004.76s)]
*  garden has held on too long. [[02:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=9006.36s)]
*  But the one thing that Biden says, [[02:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=9008.72s)]
*  which is somewhat true, he's like, [[02:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=9010.44s)]
*  well, why did they run against me? [[02:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=9012.08s)]
*  Right, I mean, it takes two things. [[02:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=9013.72s)]
*  It's like, okay, [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=9015.08s)]
*  you want to step aside, yes. [[02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=9016.0s)]
*  But then you also need the other [[02:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=9018.0s)]
*  generation to say, yeah, [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=9019.36s)]
*  I'm willing to run. [[02:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=9020.52s)]
*  And I would be shocked if someone [[02:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=9021.64s)]
*  doesn't step up and say, you know [[02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=9023.44s)]
*  what, we can do better for [[02:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=9025.36s)]
*  a minority leader after 2026. [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=9026.8s)]
*  Yeah, makes sense. [[02:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=9029.8s)]
*  All right, Representative [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=9031.199999999999s)]
*  Ro Khanna, thank you for [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=9031.96s)]

*  Congress that does that seemingly [[02:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HuQlRF5Ow&t=9040.84s)]
