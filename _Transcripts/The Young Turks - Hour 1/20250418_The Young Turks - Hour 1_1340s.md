TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

# ICE Wrongly Detains U.S. Citizen In Florida JAIL
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [April 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE)
*  Let's take a look because you're [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=0.0s)]
*  going to watch what is an emotional [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=2.2600000000000002s)]
*  reunion here, emotional moment, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  an American citizen wrongly [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=6.72s)]
*  detained, this one is a citizen, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=8.6s)]
*  my fault, by ICE reunited with [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=10.84s)]
*  his mother last night in Leon County, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=12.88s)]
*  Florida. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=15.36s)]
*  Before we get into the shocking [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=16.04s)]
*  details of this one, Cenk, I guess [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=17.84s)]
*  what can the audience expect? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=20.02s)]
*  And I stumbled off the top there [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=21.92s)]
*  because it seems like another day, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=23.44s)]
*  another person without due process, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=25.2s)]
*  another person with their rights [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=27.2s)]
*  violated here. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=28.96s)]
*  We have an actual American citizen, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=29.52s)]
*  seems like he could have cleared [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=31.400000000000002s)]
*  this up very quickly, birth [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=33.08s)]
*  certificate, social security card, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=34.56s)]
*  something. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=36.68s)]
*  And yet, the feds wanted him to [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=37.64s)]
*  stay behind bars. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=40.0s)]
*  Yeah, so first they came for [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=41.84s)]
*  people with student visas. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=44.6s)]
*  Then they came for [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=47.6s)]
*  resident aliens, that's folks who [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=49.040000000000006s)]
*  are legal residents here have green [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=51.68s)]
*  cards, that's as close to citizen [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=54.08s)]
*  as it gets. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=56.52s)]
*  And now they're coming for [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=57.8s)]
*  the citizens. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=58.8s)]
*  So look, I don't want people to [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=59.68s)]
*  panic and it's really hurting [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=61.76s)]
*  the mental health of the country [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=64.12s)]
*  for all of us to be in a panic. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=66.52s)]
*  But now that they have started [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=68.96s)]
*  detaining citizens, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=71.44s)]
*  you should probably carry your [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=73.32s)]
*  passport around. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=76.0s)]
*  And I would say mainly to [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=78.4s)]
*  minorities, but a couple of white [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=79.75999999999999s)]
*  lawyers have also been told that [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=81.68s)]
*  they should leave the country. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=83.44s)]
*  We've got updates on that as well. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=85.72000000000001s)]
*  And this is, we're starting to [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=87.72000000000001s)]
*  enter worst case scenario [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=91.64s)]
*  territory. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=94.76s)]
*  So let's give you the details. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=96.2s)]
*  Let's tell you why they did this in [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=97.56s)]
*  this particular case and [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=99.80000000000001s)]
*  talk through what might be next. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=101.52000000000001s)]
*  All right, well, Juan Carlos [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=103.96000000000001s)]
*  Lopez Gomez, born in Georgia, but [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=106.28s)]
*  lived much of his life in Mexico. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=108.80000000000001s)]
*  His first language is, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=111.08000000000001s)]
*  I'm not sure how to pronounce this, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=112.52000000000001s)]
*  Zotzil. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=115.28s)]
*  It's a Mayan language, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=115.8s)]
*  correct me if I'm wrong. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=117.24s)]
*  20 year old has a US birth [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=118.88s)]
*  certificate and [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=120.32s)]
*  a social security card. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=121.2s)]
*  Nonetheless, he was arrested under [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=122.72s)]
*  a new state immigration law that [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=124.92s)]
*  has been temporarily blocked since [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=126.75999999999999s)]
*  early this month. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=128.88s)]
*  And here's more on it. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=130.68s)]
*  The law makes it a misdemeanor for [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=131.56s)]
*  undocumented immigrants over age [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=133.6s)]
*  18 to knowingly enter Florida after [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=135.72s)]
*  entering the United States by [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=137.88s)]
*  looting or avoiding examination or [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=139.76s)]
*  inspection by immigration officers. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=142.04s)]
*  Ron DeSantis, Governor of Florida, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=144.32s)]
*  signed it into law February 14th, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=146.8s)]
*  but a US District Court judge [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=149.16s)]
*  blocked its enforcement on April 4. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=151.12s)]
*  And just today, the judge denied [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=154.44s)]
*  a state request to lift the block [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=156.04s)]
*  on the law. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=157.6s)]
*  Nonetheless, Lopez Gomez was [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=158.2s)]
*  detained in a local ICE facility. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=159.92000000000002s)]
*  Here is reporter Jackie Enos [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=161.8s)]
*  explaining what happened before [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=163.6s)]
*  that. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=165.6s)]
*  He was on his way to work from [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=166.64s)]
*  Cairo, Georgia, where he lives and [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=168.72s)]
*  where he was born into Tallahassee. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=171.4s)]
*  So that aspect of crossing [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=173.92s)]
*  the state line came into play. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=175.51999999999998s)]
*  And a state trooper stopped [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=177.44s)]
*  the car in which he was a passenger. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=178.76s)]
*  He was not the driver. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=180.51999999999998s)]
*  Citing in the arrest report that [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=182.56s)]
*  the driver was going 78 miles per [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=184.95999999999998s)]
*  hour in a 65 mile per hour zone. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=187.6s)]
*  So this eventually led to the [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=190.27999999999997s)]
*  trooper asking the passengers in [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=192.04s)]
*  the car for their identifications. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=194.07999999999998s)]
*  And the arrest report states that [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=196.23999999999998s)]
*  Juan Carlos Lopez Gomez stated [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=198.51999999999998s)]
*  that he was in the country [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=200.76s)]
*  illegally. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=202.51999999999998s)]
*  But he showed the trooper his state [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=203.4s)]
*  ID card and he told me after his [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=205.48000000000002s)]
*  release that he had also showed him [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=207.32000000000002s)]
*  a copy of his social security card [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=209.4s)]
*  and that he said that he was born [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=211.44000000000003s)]
*  in Georgia. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=213.16000000000003s)]
*  This is what I mean. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=214.88000000000002s)]
*  So why did this turn into days of [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=215.72000000000003s)]
*  detention really? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=219.4s)]
*  Well, immigration and [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=221.76000000000002s)]
*  customs enforcement formally asked [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=222.84s)]
*  the jail to hold him for 48 hours. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=224.8s)]
*  That's how. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=226.88000000000002s)]
*  Yesterday, he had his first court [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=227.92000000000002s)]
*  appearance after inspecting his [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=229.60000000000002s)]
*  birth certificate. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=231.28000000000003s)]
*  Hill County Judge LaShawn Riggins [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=232.92s)]
*  said during that hearing that this [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=235.24s)]

*  that's the worst case scenario. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=385.88s)]

*  carry your passports around. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=388.8s)]

*  And so how did I know you're from [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=397.84s)]
*  here? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=399.2s)]
*  Okay, that's it, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=400.0s)]
*  you're going to prison. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=400.84s)]
*  And then look, once you give us [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=401.91999999999996s)]
*  your passport and your birth [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=403.47999999999996s)]

*  enough to find all that information, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=406.6s)]
*  maybe we'll let you out then, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=408.64000000000004s)]
*  maybe we won't. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=410.20000000000005s)]
*  But now you know, don't dare oppose [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=411.04s)]
*  this authoritarian government. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=413.8s)]
*  So a lot of people will think that [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=417.12s)]
*  it's that category. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=418.92s)]
*  I'm not sure which category it is. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=420.28000000000003s)]
*  The second category is overwhelming [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=421.6s)]
*  incompetence and [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=424.28000000000003s)]
*  not caring about incompetence. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=425.6s)]
*  So look, there's good evidence for [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=428.64000000000004s)]
*  both. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=432.0s)]
*  So in the case of Lopez Gomez, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=433.20000000000005s)]
*  he's a US citizen, but [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=435.6s)]
*  they say that he made it onto [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=437.28000000000003s)]
*  an ICE list because he also filed [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=439.6s)]
*  a form I-94 while he was coming [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=442.44s)]
*  back into the country. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=445.28000000000003s)]
*  And so they thought, well, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=448.56s)]
*  if he's a citizen, he didn't need [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=450.48s)]
*  to file a form I-94, so [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=452.88s)]
*  put him on the list. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=454.56s)]
*  But people file that, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=456.40000000000003s)]
*  people sometimes use, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=458.16s)]
*  there's tons of dual citizens who [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=460.0s)]
*  use different passports to go [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=462.84000000000003s)]
*  inside and outside the country. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=465.32s)]
*  So are we going to round all of [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=468.56s)]
*  them up too? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=470.52s)]
*  Because hey, well, they didn't use [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=471.48s)]
*  the right passport. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=474.08s)]
*  And if you're in the Trump [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=476.40000000000003s)]
*  administration or you're a Trump [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=477.72s)]
*  supporter, before you answer yes, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=479.44s)]
*  of course, round them all up. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=481.24s)]
*  Remember, there's also Israeli and [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=482.72s)]
*  American dual citizens. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=484.8s)]
*  So if you, you might accidentally [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=486.6s)]
*  round up in Israeli, so [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=488.52s)]
*  be super careful. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=489.64s)]
*  So anyways, so if you're being [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=491.40000000000003s)]
*  enormously generous, you can say, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=494.12s)]
*  well, okay, I was deep in [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=497.2s)]

*  they made that mistake. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=501.92s)]
*  Okay, well, and I could, if it was [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=503.76s)]

*  a just incompetence. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=538.04s)]
*  That seems like they're trying to [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=540.08s)]
*  bully and intimidate even lawyers [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=542.04s)]
*  who might help immigrants. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=544.08s)]
*  So, but there is no good answer [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=546.08s)]
*  here. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=548.12s)]
*  And if I look, I often do shoe on [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=548.72s)]
*  the other foot, and what did you [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=550.52s)]
*  what if you were on the other side [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=552.24s)]
*  and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=554.0s)]
*  But is there a thing where if [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=555.28s)]

*  of course we should round up [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=558.52s)]
*  American citizens, who cares? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=560.0s)]
*  They dare to oppose Trump or [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=561.84s)]
*  they dare to be a lawyer for [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=563.9200000000001s)]
*  an immigrant, or they dare to be [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=566.0400000000001s)]
*  Latino, or they dare to fill out [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=568.44s)]

*  Is that really this is even maybe [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=572.72s)]
*  some portion of MAGA will make [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=574.72s)]
*  that argument? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=576.8000000000001s)]
*  But the great majority of the [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=578.6s)]
*  country wants no part of that. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=580.4000000000001s)]
*  And what's amazing, Brian, is if [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=582.6s)]
*  all Trump did was close down [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=584.8000000000001s)]
*  the border, he limited the number [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=586.52s)]
*  of people crossing the border [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=588.72s)]
*  dramatically, it would have been [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=590.5600000000001s)]
*  an enormous win for him politically. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=592.72s)]
*  Right? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=595.5600000000001s)]
*  Instead, he took that giant win and [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=596.12s)]
*  is somehow turning it into a loss. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=598.44s)]
*  Yes, and this is such a great [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=601.32s)]
*  point, and it is so much of Trump's [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=603.6s)]
*  playbook is that it's in the [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=606.6s)]
*  execution of these kinds of ideas [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=609.0400000000001s)]
*  and the things he ran on, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=612.0s)]
*  the execution of them that are so [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=614.16s)]

*  and just so poorly formed and [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=620.4s)]
*  defined, and I always think of that. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=622.76s)]
*  I always think of what a hero he [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=625.76s)]
*  would be to the middle of America, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=628.12s)]

*  the flow of drugs that's coming [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=640.2s)]
*  from Canada. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=642.28s)]
*  There are so many easy layup wins [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=643.2s)]
*  here, but to your point, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=646.36s)]
*  I feel like whether you're center [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=648.8000000000001s)]

*  some sort of fairness and [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=655.28s)]
*  just in the spirit of argument, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=657.5600000000001s)]
*  we always try to weigh and [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=660.32s)]
*  counterbalance the arguments. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=662.44s)]
*  I live in rural Georgia and [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=665.36s)]
*  I see who polices this area and [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=667.36s)]
*  we have US Marshals here, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=669.6800000000001s)]

*  we have local small town city [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=674.02s)]
*  police here, we have Georgia state [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=676.08s)]
*  troopers here, we have the [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=678.76s)]
*  Department of Public Safety. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=680.92s)]
*  These are all people with [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=683.76s)]
*  jurisdiction that kind of has [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=685.4s)]
*  blurred lines and they can all pull [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=687.36s)]
*  anyone over on any road. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=689.72s)]
*  There are at any one time, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=692.24s)]
*  seriously, you can just find five [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=693.64s)]
*  different kinds of wings of arms of [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=695.92s)]
*  law enforcement. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=698.1999999999999s)]
*  And I believe that in this [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=700.1999999999999s)]
*  execution we are charging perhaps [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=702.1999999999999s)]
*  incompetent law enforcement people [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=704.92s)]
*  to pull over cars. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=707.88s)]
*  And I'm wondering what the orders [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=709.48s)]
*  are within these departments to [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=711.3199999999999s)]
*  look for how to detain what papers [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=713.16s)]
*  they're looking for. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=715.16s)]
*  Which brings me to this point of [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=717.04s)]
*  Jake, we are there, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=719.0s)]

*  leather coats. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=731.7600000000001s)]

*  and baseball caps or flannel shirts, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=735.44s)]
*  they're blending in and [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=737.88s)]
*  they are knocking on doors and [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=739.48s)]
*  they are detaining people and [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=741.48s)]

*  a traumatic process that will screw [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=745.6400000000001s)]

*  get here? [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=764.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, look, so [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=765.64s)]
*  that's a great question and [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=767.12s)]
*  that actually has a complicated [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=768.76s)]
*  answer. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=770.8399999999999s)]
*  So I fought tooth and nail against [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=771.4s)]
*  Trump and I got the question all [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=773.68s)]
*  the time, and I was like, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=775.92s)]
*  And I got the question often, hey, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=778.4s)]

*  against the establishment. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=781.4s)]

*  Hillary Clinton in 2016, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=784.76s)]

*  Well, the brother said he was going [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=790.16s)]
*  to terminate the Constitution. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=791.24s)]
*  He said it, you could make any [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=792.64s)]

*  the 2020 election, he said, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=796.0s)]
*  when there's a massive fraud like [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=797.7199999999999s)]
*  this, you have to terminate [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=799.76s)]
*  the Constitution. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=801.52s)]
*  No, no, we're not going to [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=802.8399999999999s)]
*  terminate the Constitution. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=804.5999999999999s)]
*  And so MAGA and there's two [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=807.08s)]
*  different groups that voted for [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=808.76s)]

*  independence. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=812.24s)]
*  So MAGA hates the establishment so [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=813.4s)]
*  much that I think they're blinded [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=815.72s)]
*  by that rage, right? [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=817.88s)]
*  And so when we talk about how our [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=819.32s)]
*  side was blinded about Joe Biden's [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=821.08s)]
*  age and mental decline, etc. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=823.12s)]

*  right? [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=844.0s)]
*  And why I was so mad at the [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=844.56s)]
*  Democrats was they seem to care [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=846.36s)]
*  more about protecting Joe Biden's [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=848.52s)]

*  I'm like, I guess you guys don't [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=853.16s)]
*  mean it, but I mean it. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=855.24s)]
*  I'm super worried that Trump's [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=856.72s)]
*  going to be authoritarian. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=858.56s)]
*  And he has said it so many times [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=860.3199999999999s)]
*  that he loves the Democrats, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=862.56s)]

*  a dictator and how everybody stands [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=867.28s)]

*  criticize the dictator, etc. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=871.64s)]
*  He's done this, said it so [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=873.64s)]
*  many times, he's tried to violate [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=875.44s)]
*  the Constitution before and [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=877.72s)]
*  here he is doing it again. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=879.44s)]
*  So did I think that we might get [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=881.08s)]
*  here? Yes, that's why I was pulling [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=882.6800000000001s)]
*  all my hair out when people were [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=884.52s)]

*  right? [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=889.64s)]
*  No, no, don't cross your fingers, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=890.1600000000001s)]
*  run your best candidate, right? [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=892.4s)]
*  So but now to the independence, so [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=895.36s)]
*  and Brian, we're going to find out. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=898.04s)]
*  And so this is we're at one of the [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=901.52s)]
*  most critical junctures here, [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=903.84s)]
*  really in American history. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=906.1999999999999s)]
*  because my thesis was those [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=908.6s)]
*  independents didn't vote to round [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=910.64s)]
*  up American citizens and people [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=913.1999999999999s)]
*  that were legal residents here and [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=915.76s)]
*  didn't do anything wrong. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=918.48s)]
*  They didn't vote to round them up [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=920.84s)]
*  based on freedom of speech or [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=923.04s)]
*  offending Trump or offending Israel [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=924.8s)]
*  or anything like that. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=926.84s)]
*  They voted on inflation and [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=928.08s)]
*  immigration, right? [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=929.44s)]
*  And so inflation being number one [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=930.44s)]
*  and by immigration, they largely [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=932.44s)]
*  meant close the border, right? [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=934.4s)]
*  That's why we're fair and we say, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=936.72s)]
*  hey, listen, if he'd closed [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=938.64s)]
*  the border and he didn't do these [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=940.16s)]
*  weirdo global nuclear tariffs that [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=942.0s)]
*  increased prices. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=944.12s)]
*  He actually could have been pretty [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=946.12s)]
*  popular because that is what [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=947.6s)]
*  the independents voted for, right? [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=948.84s)]
*  So now that they see with their own [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=950.6s)]
*  eyes, right, it turns out he does [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=952.64s)]
*  have an authoritarian desires. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=955.4s)]
*  And what is he doing here? [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=957.96s)]
*  Why bother going on constitutional? [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=960.8s)]
*  Why bother doing things that are [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=965.16s)]
*  unpopular when he had it? [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=967.0s)]
*  He was popular in the beginning, [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=969.04s)]
*  especially after close the border [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=970.8s)]
*  because he's testing it. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=972.56s)]
*  He's constantly testing things. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=974.3199999999999s)]
*  And he's testing how much of [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=976.8s)]
*  the law can I violate? [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=978.48s)]
*  How much of the constitution can I [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=980.0s)]
*  violate before I get pushback? [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=982.0s)]
*  So this is when the independents [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=984.96s)]
*  that voted for him and [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=986.44s)]
*  if there's good folks in the mega [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=987.52s)]
*  world who actually believe in [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=989.28s)]
*  our constitution, and [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=990.8s)]
*  I believe there are some, okay? [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=991.96s)]
*  Not all but some. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=993.84s)]
*  But all those voters have to, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=995.32s)]
*  because he already hates the left. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=996.72s)]
*  He's not going to listen to us. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=998.64s)]
*  And the more we are against it, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1000.24s)]
*  the happier he is, right? [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1001.8s)]
*  But those Trump voters have to say [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1003.52s)]
*  at some point, all right, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1006.08s)]
*  look, it happens. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1008.2s)]
*  I mean, it happens all the time. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1010.08s)]
*  It happens to the left, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1011.48s)]
*  it happens to the right, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1012.1600000000001s)]
*  it happens to Democrats, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1012.84s)]
*  it happens to Republicans. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1013.7600000000001s)]
*  But we got duped. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1014.5200000000001s)]
*  And this is not what we've [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1016.12s)]
*  signed up for. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1017.32s)]
*  We signed up for inflation and [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1018.4000000000001s)]
*  immigration. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1019.8000000000001s)]
*  We didn't sign you a sign up for [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1020.6800000000001s)]
*  rounding up American citizens and [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1022.4000000000001s)]
*  taking away their rights. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1024.2s)]
*  So hell no. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1025.64s)]
*  And so if he gets that pushback, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1027.1200000000001s)]
*  he hates being unpopular, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1029.2s)]
*  then maybe he turns around. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1030.96s)]
*  If he doesn't get that pushback, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1032.8s)]
*  then he won't turn around. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1034.76s)]
*  So that's the moment we're in right [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1036.76s)]
*  now, and that's why it's [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1039.0800000000002s)]
*  absolutely critical. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1040.64s)]
*  Tell me, are you both struck by [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1042.1200000000001s)]
*  the complicity of the people who [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1043.88s)]
*  sit on the golden couch next to [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1045.76s)]
*  him, Pam Bondi, Secretary of State [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1047.5600000000002s)]
*  Marco Ribio, these are people who [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1049.96s)]
*  history will look on as complicit [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1052.5200000000002s)]
*  in this. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1054.8400000000001s)]
*  I mean, where are we going to be in [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1055.64s)]
*  two years? [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1058.3600000000001s)]
*  Where were all of those, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1059.24s)]
*  the people who are enabling Trump? [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1061.16s)]
*  Look how big the people are, [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1064.1200000000001s)]
*  they're not going to be [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1066.2s)]
*  the people who are enabling Trump. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1067.92s)]
*  Look how proud he is of these [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1070.0s)]
*  initiatives and the way he defers, [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1072.0800000000002s)]
*  Pam Bondi can answer that for you. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1074.8400000000001s)]
*  He's got these people owned, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1077.5200000000002s)]
*  lock, stock and barrel. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1079.8400000000001s)]
*  He's got them wrapped around his [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1081.4s)]
*  fingers. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1083.92s)]
*  It's so offensive to watch them lie [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1084.72s)]
*  and they know they're lying. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1087.6000000000001s)]
*  And so I just wonder where we're [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1089.7600000000002s)]
*  going to be in a year or two, [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1092.2s)]
*  because this is such a young and [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1094.2800000000002s)]
*  administration and already the [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1096.72s)]
*  wheels have come off the clown car [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1099.24s)]
*  and he's teasing these federal [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1101.88s)]
*  courts and he's teasing the Supreme [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1104.4s)]
*  Court. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1107.44s)]
*  I mean, I wonder what they talk [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1108.1200000000001s)]
*  about at their lunchtime. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1110.1200000000001s)]
*  I mean, they've enabled this too. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1111.64s)]
*  I don't know where this is all [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1113.64s)]
*  headed, but it can't be good. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1115.3600000000001s)]
*  Can't be good. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1117.16s)]
*  So I have a theory on that that [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1118.16s)]
*  I run by you guys. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1119.68s)]
*  Look, I think that this is going to [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1120.64s)]
*  go in layers, right? [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1123.3200000000002s)]
*  So he's testing how much he could [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1125.0s)]
*  violate the Constitution, [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1127.4s)]
*  how much he could abuse things, [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1129.56s)]
*  right? [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1132.04s)]
*  So either he'll get huge pushback [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1132.64s)]
*  in the form of popularity, [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1135.24s)]
*  approval polls plummeting. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1137.64s)]
*  because he was above 50 at one [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1140.2s)]
*  point, which for him is a minor [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1142.16s)]
*  miracle. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1144.16s)]
*  He'd never been above 50. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1144.68s)]
*  And in the beginning of this [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1146.08s)]
*  administration, again, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1147.44s)]
*  we're a fair show. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1148.68s)]
*  We tell you what's real, [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1149.64s)]
*  he was above 50 and he was really [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1151.0s)]
*  as popular as he's ever been. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1152.88s)]
*  And so in two months since then, [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1155.64s)]
*  he's battered those numbers. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1157.88s)]
*  He's done almost everything he can [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1160.3200000000002s)]
*  to lower them. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1162.0800000000002s)]
*  And despite the closing of [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1163.0800000000002s)]
*  the border, which is very popular [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1164.5600000000002s)]
*  in America, he's going to now [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1166.5200000000002s)]
*  start heading down into the 40s and [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1168.3200000000002s)]
*  the 30s. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1170.44s)]
*  And if he keeps going like this, [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1171.96s)]
*  he'll hit the 20s. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1173.76s)]
*  So now if he pulls a classic Trump [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1175.16s)]
*  as he did with the tariffs, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1178.1200000000001s)]
*  yeah, this is all part of the deal. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1180.6000000000001s)]
*  And part of my grand global [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1185.4s)]
*  strategy of, I first I arrest [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1186.8799999999999s)]
*  the Americans to take away their [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1188.52s)]
*  constitutional rights. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1190.24s)]
*  And then later I give them back and [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1191.96s)]
*  I brag about how I gave you [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1193.56s)]
*  constitutional rights, right? [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1194.72s)]
*  Okay, whatever, dude, [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1196.8799999999999s)]
*  make any excuse you like, [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1197.92s)]
*  just turn around, turn around, [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1199.12s)]
*  right? [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1200.56s)]
*  If he does that, then Brian, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1201.48s)]
*  all the Pam Bondis and [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1203.08s)]
*  the JD Vances and all the [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1204.24s)]
*  Republicans will pretend that it [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1205.44s)]
*  never happened. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1206.96s)]
*  And every time we bring it up, [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1208.28s)]
*  they'll go, no, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1209.72s)]
*  you guys are overreacting. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1210.6s)]
*  And Trump changed that four months [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1211.84s)]
*  and then whoa, whoa, right? [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1213.8s)]
*  But if he doesn't turn around and [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1216.04s)]
*  he starts heading into the 30s and [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1217.96s)]
*  20s, and then there's an election [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1220.08s)]
*  coming up, the midterms, right? [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1222.2s)]
*  Not right now, but [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1224.48s)]
*  there isn't a year and a half. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1225.28s)]
*  And so the Republicans will get [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1226.72s)]
*  slaughtered in that election. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1229.04s)]
*  And so if at that point, [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1232.0s)]
*  are the Republican politicians [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1233.44s)]
*  going to panic and go, okay, [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1235.44s)]
*  now it's as to quote Senator [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1237.48s)]
*  Kennedy, it's my ass on the line, [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1239.52s)]
*  right? [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1242.1599999999999s)]
*  And whenever it's their ass on [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1243.32s)]
*  the line, then all of a sudden, [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1244.6s)]
*  they find a way to stand up to [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1246.0s)]
*  Trump, right? [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1247.4399999999998s)]
*  So, but if they go to realize that [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1249.12s)]
*  they're going to get slaughtered in [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1251.56s)]
*  the midterms, and then they start [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1254.24s)]
*  talking about maybe not having [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1256.74s)]
*  midterms, okay, that's when if the [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1259.04s)]
*  Rogans of the world and the bros [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1261.6399999999999s)]
*  fear and anyone who pretended to [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1263.8s)]
*  care about the Constitution, [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1266.04s)]
*  if they don't rise up at that [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1268.4399999999998s)]
*  point, then we're toast, okay? [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1270.56s)]
*  But then everyone who doesn't rise [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1273.84s)]
*  up is saying I'm cool with [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1275.76s)]
*  the dictatorship. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1277.04s)]
*  And so the red line, [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1278.52s)]
*  there's two red lines, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1279.84s)]
*  him not listening to the courts. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1281.3999999999999s)]
*  He doesn't listen to the courts, [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1283.9199999999998s)]
*  he's completely out of bounds of [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1285.6799999999998s)]
*  the Constitution. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1287.3999999999999s)]
*  So far, he's tested the waters, [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1288.72s)]
*  don't listen here, [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1290.3999999999999s)]
*  don't listen for a short period of [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1291.48s)]
*  time, but then come back into [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1293.24s)]
*  the courts. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1294.84s)]
*  If the Supreme Court rules, no, [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1295.6s)]
*  bring back Abrego Garcia or [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1297.4399999999998s)]
*  anything else. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1299.04s)]
*  And Trump says, no, [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1300.48s)]
*  I'm not bringing him back. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1301.12s)]
*  I don't care what the Supreme Court [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1302.2s)]
*  says, that is the deepest of red [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1303.96s)]
*  lines. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1305.76s)]
*  That means we're in an [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1306.68s)]
*  authoritarian government already, [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1307.6000000000001s)]
*  okay? [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1309.24s)]
*  And the second red line is any talk [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1309.76s)]
*  of canceling the midterms or [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1311.8s)]
*  moving the midterms or anything, [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1313.4s)]
*  another deep, deep red line. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1315.44s)]
*  If at that point, every show and [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1317.64s)]
*  every media figure and [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1319.88s)]
*  every politician isn't looking to [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1321.44s)]
*  throw out Donald Trump, [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1323.76s)]
*  that means they are literally [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1325.4s)]
*  signing up for a dictatorship. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1327.24s)]
*  They're the bad guys, and [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1328.8400000000001s)]
*  I will never, ever, ever forgive [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1330.72s)]
*  them. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbd3CwHVpEE&t=1332.92s)]
