*  has just been, you know, not good. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=21.92s)]
*  I'm so upset. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=51.52s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=53.160000000000004s)]
*  Well, hello. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=54.160000000000004s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=82.52s)]
*  Welcome to Young Turks. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=83.52s)]
*  Cenk Huger and Xpherian with you guys. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=84.52s)]
*  Let's do a show that gives you the truth and tries to help the world a little bit. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=85.52s)]
*  Is that crazy? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=110.88s)]
*  That's a little crazy, but that's what we try to do every day here for you guys. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=111.88s)]
*  So do we have stories on Gaza and Israel? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=115.16s)]
*  Fortunately, we do. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=119.6s)]
*  We do. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=120.67999999999999s)]
*  I'm hearing rumblings, rumors of potential good news, but we're not there yet. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=122.11999999999999s)]
*  We're still at bad news. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=127.39999999999999s)]
*  And oh my God, the hatred against Mom Donnie is through the roof. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=129.88s)]
*  The establishment, well, that's actually what we're asking on the website. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=134.6s)]
*  Do you think the establishment will be able to get them in the general election? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=137.84s)]
*  Because there's now people saying they're going to spend literally hundreds of millions [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=141.76s)]
*  of dollars on a mayoral race. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=146.64000000000001s)]
*  And yeah, and they have a lot of claims as to why they're doing that. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=150.32s)]
*  The number one reason is he's opposed to Israel. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=154.72s)]
*  It can't be allowed to stand. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=158.4s)]
*  By the way- [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=162.08s)]
*  He would be mayor. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=163.08s)]
*  If he wins the general election, he would be the mayor of a city. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=164.08s)]
*  Who cares what his foreign policy views are? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=170.84s)]
*  He has no say on foreign policy. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=173.4s)]
*  People have lost their minds. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=176.76000000000002s)]
*  They've totally lost their minds. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=177.88000000000002s)]
*  100%. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=179.36s)]
*  So the poll's up on tyt.com. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=180.36s)]
*  We'll keep track on it throughout the show when we get to that. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=182.0s)]
*  But what's amazing is that no one's asked his foreign policy views on Pakistan, right? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=186.28s)]
*  Or even as far as I know, even Ukraine, which is huge in the news, right? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=192.4s)]
*  Or Indonesia. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=197.48000000000002s)]
*  But they're obsessed about his views about Israel and the fact that he's Muslim. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=198.82s)]
*  God, they are so scared of that. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=203.32s)]
*  Anyway, if you want to know what the problems are, we just got these t-shirts in and I'm [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=204.84s)]
*  wearing them today. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=208.64000000000001s)]
*  What I keep telling you guys, I've just said it on many interviews, check them out on tyt.com [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=210.20000000000002s)]
*  slash press. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=213.8s)]
*  Don't look down to see where your problems are. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=215.62s)]
*  It's not the undocumented immigrant that came in with no money. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=217.4s)]
*  Don't look to your left and to your right. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=220.70000000000002s)]
*  Constantly, they want you fighting left to right, left and right. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=222.32s)]
*  Look up, look up, okay? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=226.07999999999998s)]
*  The people who rigged the game, the people who are in charge have the money and the power. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=228.66s)]
*  They're up, okay? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=233.64s)]
*  So shop tyt.com. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=235.51999999999998s)]
*  All right, Anna, let's get going. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=236.51999999999998s)]
*  Well, there was a big announcement made by the government of Israel today and it should [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=239.56s)]
*  come to no surprise because this isn't the first time they've done it. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=244.44s)]
*  So without further ado, here are the details. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=247.07999999999998s)]
*  Hundreds of people have been killed, more than a thousand wounded while looking for [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=250.88s)]
*  food at the private militarized so-called aid sites which replaced UN distribution centers [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=254.0s)]
*  in May. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=260.44s)]
*  The entire population of Gaza, 2.1 million people, experience prolonged shortages of [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=261.52s)]
*  food. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=267.48s)]
*  Half a million are in a catastrophic situation of hunger, acute malnutrition, starvation [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=268.48s)]
*  and illness, according to the World Health Organization. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=273.24s)]
*  Well, aside from the fact that Palestinians continued getting slaughtered at these humanitarian [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=278.32s)]
*  aid hubs by the IDF and the IDF admits that they would fire warning shots. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=284.71999999999997s)]
*  Israel has also decided to halt aid deliveries into Gaza again. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=290.96s)]
*  And that's according to the Israeli station, Channel 12 News. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=296.76s)]
*  Apparently Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is justifying further starving the Palestinian [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=300.68s)]
*  people by doing what Israelis always do, blame Hamas even when they're the ones responsible [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=306.12s)]
*  for the behavior. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=312.6s)]
*  Now, Netanyahu's office announced that he ordered the military to present a plan within [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=313.6s)]
*  the next two days on how to keep Hamas from stealing humanitarian assistance. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=318.88s)]
*  So that's the cover story. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=324.32s)]
*  We don't want to deliver aid to starving Palestinians because we're worried Hamas is stealing it. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=326.26s)]
*  In reality, the Israel backed Gaza Humanitarian Aid Foundation was luring desperate Palestinians [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=332.34s)]
*  to these hubs where they were supposed to get the aid that they so desperately need. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=339.2s)]
*  And then you'd have IDF soldiers firing on them. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=344.38s)]
*  As by the way, Israeli Gideon Levy said on Piers Morgan's show just yesterday, take a [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=347.26s)]
*  look. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=352.94s)]
*  I must remind ourselves that when the UN agencies distributed the aid, there were no killed [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=354.46s)]
*  It all started with this monster organization of putting two, three stations in the Gaza [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=362.21999999999997s)]
*  street for two million people, almost as an experiment in human beings, in starving human [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=369.78s)]
*  beings. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=376.41999999999996s)]
*  None of them was killed in purpose. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=377.41999999999996s)]
*  All of them by chance. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=379.61999999999995s)]
*  All of them potential threat to the soldiers. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=381.34s)]
*  How dare you to spread this propaganda knowing that you are lying? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=384.58s)]
*  Again, that was Gideon Levy who is in fact Israeli and has been critical of the Israeli [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=391.66s)]
*  government in the past. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=396.82000000000005s)]
*  Now, at least 103 Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire over the past 24 hours, local [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=397.82000000000005s)]
*  health authorities said, including some shot near an aid distribution point, the latest [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=404.12s)]
*  in a series of such incidents. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=409.3s)]
*  The Israeli military had no immediate comment. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=411.1s)]
*  That is the real issue here. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=413.70000000000005s)]
*  And this whole notion that Hamas is stealing aid and Israel wants to investigate this in [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=415.98s)]
*  order to find a better way to deliver aid is complete bunk. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=421.7s)]
*  It's nonsense. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=424.98s)]
*  In regard to halting that humanitarian aid from entering the Gaza Strip, the Prime Minister's [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=426.38s)]
*  office came after or his announcement came after Finance Minister Basel El Smotrich, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=430.2s)]
*  who wants to starve the Palestinians to death by the way, threatened that he could no longer [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=436.38s)]
*  remain in the government if immediate action wasn't taken to prevent aid from reaching [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=440.86s)]
*  Hamas. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=446.1s)]
*  Now, any normal person who's not a sociopath would say, good day, sir, go ahead and leave [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=447.1s)]
*  the government, you're not wanted. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=453.34000000000003s)]
*  But of course, there is a fragile coalition that makes up the current Israeli government. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=455.14000000000004s)]
*  Without that coalition Netanyahu knows that he'll no longer be in power. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=460.70000000000005s)]
*  And of course, he's very much concerned about that. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=464.40000000000003s)]
*  And if there's any evidence that's being shown to prove that Hamas is stealing the aid, what [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=468.14s)]
*  the Israelis are circulating online is this video that shows dozens of masked men, some [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=475.26s)]
*  armed with rifles, but most carrying sticks riding on aid trucks. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=480.1s)]
*  Okay, well, what is that about? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=484.86s)]
*  Turns out the higher commission for tribal affairs, which represents influential clans [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=486.82s)]
*  in the territory, said the trucks had been protected as part of an aid security process, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=491.4s)]
*  managed solely through tribal efforts. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=497.42s)]
*  The commission said that no Palestinian faction, a reference to Hamas, had taken part in the [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=500.5s)]
*  process. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=506.46s)]
*  The clans came to form a stance to prevent the aggression and the thieves from stealing [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=507.46s)]
*  the food that belongs to our people. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=512.66s)]
*  Abu Salman al Maghani, a representative of Gazan clan, said, referring to a Wednesday [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=515.5s)]
*  operation. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=523.14s)]
*  And look, I don't trust Hamas at all. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=524.62s)]
*  Hamas says they've done no such thing. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=526.58s)]
*  They've never stolen any humanitarian aid. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=528.5s)]
*  I'm sure that there's been instances where they have. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=530.3000000000001s)]
*  But in regard to the video that they're circulating, you have to keep in mind we're talking about [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=532.9000000000001s)]
*  starving Palestinians. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=536.38s)]
*  They've been intentionally starved for months and months. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=537.62s)]
*  And so when they see a humanitarian aid truck come through, they're going to rush toward [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=541.1s)]
*  the truck because they want food. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=545.46s)]
*  They need sustenance to feed their families. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=547.38s)]
*  So the argument here from the higher commission for tribal affairs is that they're providing [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=549.94s)]
*  security to ensure that chaos doesn't break out. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=554.32s)]
*  Although these humanitarian aid hubs, Cenk, as you know, have been chaotic and have led [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=558.6s)]
*  to dozens of Palestinians getting shot and killed on a daily basis since late May. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=562.5200000000001s)]
*  So the UN and other groups used to do this aid system where they would hand out the food. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=568.2s)]
*  And to Anna's point, to Gideon Levy's point, no one ever got shot at those stations. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=573.8000000000001s)]
*  People got the food. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=578.1s)]
*  It was orderly. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=579.1s)]
*  Largely speaking, Hamas did not steal the food, certainly not systematically. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=580.86s)]
*  There's always bad actors in any given situation. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=584.78s)]
*  I'm gonna come back to that because I'm gonna knock down a propaganda point of Israel that [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=587.58s)]
*  it's important to knock down. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=591.34s)]
*  But so now that Israel's running the centers, the problem is if you don't have anyone guarding [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=593.5s)]
*  the food on the other side, since people are starving, there's going to be mayhem. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=599.14s)]
*  And that's part of the reason why Israel did this, because they want the Palestinians [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=604.96s)]
*  fighting amongst themselves. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=607.98s)]
*  They want them desperate and then they want any excuse to kill them. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=609.68s)]
*  So the minute that there's any kind of disturbance by the food, they're like perfect, open fire. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=614.16s)]
*  And they just start slurring. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=618.24s)]
*  By the way, Israel killed 103 Palestinians yesterday. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=619.24s)]
*  Does anybody notice? [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=623.84s)]
*  Is there any big headlines? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=625.22s)]
*  No, they're like, we have 20 hostages, and that's terrible, okay? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=626.48s)]
*  But wait, just on one day alone, would I kill 103 innocent people to maybe put pressure [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=631.24s)]
*  on to get 20 hostages back months later or whenever? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=637.92s)]
*  No, I wouldn't kill 103 innocent people no matter what. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=641.9599999999999s)]
*  And they do it every single day, massacre after massacre. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=645.36s)]
*  It just doesn't get it reported as much anymore because people just got tired of reporting [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=649.5999999999999s)]
*  the same old news. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=653.4599999999999s)]
*  Israel slaughters more innocent Palestinians every single day. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=655.2199999999999s)]
*  So it's not an accident, they're doing it on purpose. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=659.8s)]
*  Now the reason you need other people on the other side is order, right? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=661.68s)]
*  So that it doesn't turn into mayhem and people don't hurt each other. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=664.88s)]
*  So since it can't be Hamas, not only Israel doesn't want Hamas, but the Palestinians in [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=667.52s)]
*  that case don't want Hamas to take it because they need it for their family. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=672.4s)]
*  So the traditional tribal clans have stepped in. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=676.24s)]
*  And now apparently Fattah is also coming in. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=680.0s)]
*  They run the West Bank and they are sworn enemies of Hamas, okay? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=682.12s)]
*  So they're trying to make sure that Hamas does not get the food. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=687.96s)]
*  They're doing every effort they can to make sure that doesn't happen. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=690.76s)]
*  But Israel goes, who cares? [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=694.4399999999999s)]
*  All dirty Muslims, Fattah, Hamas, they're opposed to each other, tribal clans, who cares? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=696.4s)]
*  It's all an excuse to starve them, to kill them. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=702.28s)]
*  So cutting off the aid, Gideon Levy's right, Anna's right, it's not even close. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=705.24s)]
*  It's definitely because Maslow Smote-Rich, his name even sounds demonic, like Blasol. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=708.92s)]
*  Anyway, it doesn't matter because his name could be perfectly great, his name could be [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=715.4s)]
*  terrible and he could do wonderful things. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=719.68s)]
*  The bottom line is the guy is a certifiable monster. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=721.84s)]
*  So we're not just saying this to get you to, my God, we'll rile you up against some Israeli [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=725.84s)]
*  minister. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=733.4s)]
*  No, what Anna said is literal. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=734.4s)]
*  He said in public, if he could, he'd not only starve the Palestinians to death, he'd make [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=736.1600000000001s)]
*  it quicker by cutting the water so that they would all die of thirst. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=742.1600000000001s)]
*  But he said, but I can't because of international pressure. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=746.52s)]
*  So we have to pretend to be feeding them and keep them on the brink of starvation. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=750.2s)]
*  He's spoken like a true Nazi. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=754.28s)]
*  And I don't hesitate at all in calling him a Nazi. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=757.28s)]
*  I mean, okay, so now let's use that analogy for a second and I don't care if you get offended. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=761.04s)]
*  I'm 10 million times more offended by the genocide that Israel supporters are protecting [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=765.76s)]
*  and defending right now. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=771.12s)]
*  10,000 times more offended by the 17,000 dead kids and the 20,000 dead women, okay? [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=772.6s)]
*  And if you're not, then you're saying, yeah, I don't care about Muslim lives. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=779.8399999999999s)]
*  I just care about, am I offended? [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=783.36s)]
*  Okay, so let me offend you further, okay? [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=785.24s)]
*  Now, and think about it. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=786.8399999999999s)]
*  If you're not biased in this issue, this is going to be blaringly and glaringly obvious, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=788.04s)]
*  okay? [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=793.56s)]
*  Imagine if in the middle of the Holocaust, the Germans said, some of the Jewish prisoners [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=794.56s)]
*  are stealing the food. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=799.36s)]
*  They've come up with a little organized gang of Jews. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=800.8399999999999s)]
*  And that is why we're starving all the Jews to death. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=804.36s)]
*  Would anyone believe them? [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=808.36s)]
*  I see, some Jews are stealing some of the food because you've got them in starvation [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=810.48s)]
*  concentration camps. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=816.76s)]
*  So that's why you're preventing all of the Jews from getting the food, so you starve [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=819.4s)]
*  all of them. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=823.8s)]
*  Well, no one would accept that ridiculous propaganda from the Nazis. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=824.8s)]
*  But that is literally what the Israelis are saying. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=830.08s)]
*  Some small group of Palestinians might be stealing some of the food. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=834.36s)]
*  That is why we're starving the entire population. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=840.84s)]
*  Well, you see, that's an obvious lie. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=844.12s)]
*  They're starving them on purpose because they have become what they most feared. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=847.6s)]
*  And one more thing for now, and I got more details in a sec. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=851.96s)]
*  But look, I'm so proud that I was the partner with Gideon Levy in the debate we did on Israel. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=855.9200000000001s)]
*  And what I really appreciate is, well, we already had tons of Jewish Americans speaking [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=862.16s)]
*  out against this genocide. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=865.88s)]
*  Now brave Israelis are coming out and going, no, no, this is not what we signed up for. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=867.92s)]
*  This is what we hate. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=873.44s)]
*  What are we doing? [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=874.44s)]
*  This is insanity. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=875.52s)]
*  So thank you for speaking out and being a moral voice within Israel, Ana. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=876.76s)]
*  All right, well, I was planning on moving on, so- [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=881.8s)]
*  Yeah, then I just wanna say last two things here, guys. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=885.2s)]
*  So number one, the reason Smoltrich wants to starve them is cuz he wants to push them [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=891.24s)]
*  into the Sinai desert in Egypt and take all of Gaza. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=897.0s)]
*  Again, not speculation, he has said it. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=900.48s)]
*  He said we should take all of Gaza and they have voted to quote unquote conquer Gaza. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=903.16s)]
*  If he leaves the coalition Netanyahu is out. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=907.5s)]
*  I have heard rumors, this is massive speculation and it comes from the right wing. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=909.5600000000001s)]
*  So take it with a boulder of salt that they're working on a two state solution peace deal. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=914.6800000000001s)]
*  I would be floored, floored by that. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=920.44s)]
*  But the reason that I'm bringing that up as a possibility here is that Netanyahu soon [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=923.4s)]
*  will have to make a decision. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=928.5600000000001s)]
*  Am I going to keep that coalition government together with the right wing Nazis in his [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=930.2s)]
*  government like Smoltrich and Ben Gavir, like convicted terrorists and proud genociders? [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=935.12s)]
*  Or am I gonna do a deal with Trump and the US and we're gonna lead to a ceasefire? [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=943.08s)]
*  Again, two state solution seems unimaginable at this point. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=948.28s)]
*  But if they went in that direction and they ended all this, then he wouldn't need necessarily [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=952.36s)]
*  Smoltrich and Ben Gavir. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=956.8000000000001s)]
*  He might be able to make an alliance with other people in the Knesset. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=958.96s)]
*  Because the only thing that Netanyahu cares about is staying in power and of course murdering [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=962.28s)]
*  Palestinians, cuz he enjoys that and stealing their land. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=965.9200000000001s)]
*  He loves that, that's been his lifelong mission. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=970.28s)]
*  But overall, he might think, hey, you know what, I stole enough land here, I killed enough [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=972.7s)]
*  Palestinians here, I'm gonna stay in power with this alliance rather than that alliance. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=976.68s)]
*  It's a tough, tough thing to believe. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=981.3599999999999s)]
*  It's a real stretch. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=984.12s)]
*  I'll only believe it after I see the deal. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=985.8s)]
*  But usually what'll happen is they'll promise something like that. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=987.8399999999999s)]
*  And then they'll come back and go, yeah, two state solution where they continue to be occupied [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=990.66s)]
*  and we control both the Israeli side and the Palestinian side. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=994.4s)]
*  We're gonna call it a two state solution, but they live under permanent oppression and [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=998.4799999999999s)]
*  they serve us and we can kill them anytime we like. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1001.76s)]
*  That's usually how it goes, but maybe there's a strand of hope there. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1004.52s)]
*  But for now, the starvation continues. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1009.16s)]
*  There will never be any hope unless the United States allows the international community [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1012.0799999999999s)]
*  to ensure that Israel follows through in allowing Palestinians to have their own state and an [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1016.4s)]
*  opportunity at self-determination. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1024.04s)]
*  But Israel will never never allow that and they've been clear about it. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1025.96s)]
*  So the US will always provide cover for Israel unless we change the way politics works in [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1028.96s)]
*  this country. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1035.0s)]
*  And I don't wanna give people false hope. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1036.44s)]
*  The problem is the cover that the United States provides for any and all wrongdoing carried [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1039.08s)]
*  off by the Israeli government. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1044.3600000000001s)]
*  Anyway, let's move on to the next story. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1046.04s)]
*  I just wanna talk about what, is Trump in the Epstein-Fauz? [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1048.04s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1052.28s)]
*  Okay, because he put out something recently that I think is strange. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1053.28s)]
*  Let's get into it. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1058.2s)]
*  Israel, as soon as we made the deal, they came out and they dropped a load of bombs, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1059.2s)]
*  the likes of which I've never seen before. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1064.24s)]
*  The biggest load that we've seen. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1066.56s)]
*  I'm not happy with Israel. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1068.32s)]
*  When I say, okay, now you have 12 hours, you don't go out in the first hour and just drop [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1069.64s)]
*  everything you have on them. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1075.44s)]
*  So I'm not happy with them. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1076.44s)]
*  I'm not happy with Iran either. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1078.28s)]
*  But I'm really unhappy if Israel's going out this morning. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1080.24s)]
*  They basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1083.2s)]
*  don't know what the **** they're doing. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1088.6000000000001s)]
*  Do you understand that? [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1090.4s)]
*  I understand that. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1093.4s)]
*  And while Trump had some pretty harsh feedback for Israel at the start of this week, the [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1094.72s)]
*  president is now providing cover for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's corruption, [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1100.16s)]
*  in which he's facing serious charges and trials over. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1105.28s)]
*  Now in a lengthy truth social post, Trump said the following, quote, I was shocked to [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1109.4s)]
*  hear that the state of Israel, which has just had one of its greatest moments in history. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1113.44s)]
*  I'm gonna do my best not to vomit as I read this statement, so just bear with me. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1119.72s)]
*  And is strongly led by Bibi Netanyahu, is continuing its ridiculous witch hunt against [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1126.5800000000002s)]
*  their great wartime prime minister. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1131.4s)]
*  Bibi and I just went through hell together, fighting a very tough and brilliant long time [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1134.96s)]
*  enemy of Israel, Iran. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1140.88s)]
*  And Bibi could not have been better, sharper or stronger in his love for the incredible [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1143.0800000000002s)]
*  Holy Land. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1149.5200000000002s)]
*  Despite all of this, I just learned that Bibi has been summoned to court on Monday for the [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1151.1200000000001s)]
*  continuation of this long running politically motivated case in order to do him great harm. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1155.68s)]
*  Such a witch hunt for a man who has given so much is unthinkable to me. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1162.36s)]
*  Now Netanyahu is facing some very serious charges, a lot of pay to play schemes, quid [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1168.76s)]
*  pro quo, corruption. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1177.1999999999998s)]
*  I'm gonna get into the details in just a minute, but I wanna give you an opportunity to comment [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1179.6399999999999s)]
*  on what Trump wrote there, Cenk. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1183.4799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I think there's a couple of possibilities. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1185.8s)]
*  One is as you were joking in the beginning, I've seen files. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1188.8s)]
*  Another is, they APAC or the Adelson's have promised a new bucket of several hundred million [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1193.28s)]
*  dollars. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1199.9599999999998s)]
*  We've told you many times Trump has gotten $337 million just from the Adelson family to [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1200.9599999999998s)]
*  do whatever Israel demands. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1206.6399999999999s)]
*  But as you saw in that first clip, he didn't in the case of Iran. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1208.48s)]
*  When they wanted to continue bombing, Trump said no, which is surprising, but we're here [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1211.84s)]
*  to deliver the real news to you and not what you wanna hear necessarily. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1217.2s)]
*  And so Trump did the right thing in that case. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1220.28s)]
*  Now he's back to being an Israeli butler and holding Netanyahu's chair for him. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1222.8400000000001s)]
*  So it makes you wonder why. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1229.16s)]
*  But there is a third possible reason, which is that he thinks, look, I got Israel to stop, [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1230.24s)]
*  that was hard. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1236.8s)]
*  They have enormous power within America. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1237.88s)]
*  And since Netanyahu listened to me there, I'm going to give him a carrot here, carrots [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1240.4s)]
*  and sticks. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1246.28s)]
*  And the carrot is, you should stop his corruption trial. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1247.32s)]
*  It is a terrible conspiracy against my beloved Bibi. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1250.8799999999999s)]
*  But we do know that he called Bibi Netanyahu when Netanyahu wanted to drop more bombs on [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1254.12s)]
*  Iran and apparently ripped into him. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1259.16s)]
*  So he's playing carrots and sticks here is another possibility. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1263.72s)]
*  There's one more possibility, Cenk, and it's the likelihood that Trump looks at another [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1268.72s)]
*  world leader who's accused of corruption and says, there before the grace of God go I. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1274.3999999999999s)]
*  I think he probably relates to Netanyahu when it comes to issues of corruption. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1279.8s)]
*  100%, Ana, you're right. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1284.4399999999998s)]
*  That's a fourth possibility because he's let so many white collar criminals go in America. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1286.76s)]
*  Pardon people on fraud charges, almost always white collar crime. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1292.28s)]
*  A lot of them have paid him off, but a couple I can't even see if they did a campaign contribution [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1297.28s)]
*  or bought some meme coin or whatever junk he has. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1302.24s)]
*  I just think that he has this like, and that's part of why he let Blagojevich go, the former [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1304.96s)]
*  corrupt Democratic governor of Illinois. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1311.0800000000002s)]
*  If he knows you personally, he's much more likely to give you a pardon or push for one. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1313.7600000000002s)]
*  And if you're corrupt or fraudulent, etc., then he's like, well, yeah, then he sees a [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1319.0800000000002s)]
*  kindred spirit. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1324.92s)]
*  So that is a fourth possibility. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1326.1200000000001s)]
*  So I wanna get you a few details about the corruption charges themselves. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1328.24s)]
*  And I'm really happy that these charges haven't been dropped. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1333.04s)]
*  Despite the fact that there's an ongoing genocide in Gaza, Netanyahu will have to go to court [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1336.1200000000001s)]
*  on Monday. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1341.8400000000001s)]
*  So I'm again, very happy about that. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1342.8400000000001s)]
*  So Netanyahu is currently on trial for three corruption cases, not just one, that include [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1344.8s)]
*  accusations of fraud, bribery, and breach of trust. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1350.24s)]
*  So case 1000 has to do with the Hollywood billionaire who allegedly bribed him in return [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1354.6s)]
*  for some favors. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1360.56s)]
*  So he is charged with fraud and breach of trust surrounding allegations that he and [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1361.8s)]
*  his wife, Sarah, received expensive gifts illicitly from Hollywood media mogul Arnon [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1365.72s)]
*  Milken worth some $206,231. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1372.04s)]
*  And that Netanyahu violated conflict of interest laws when he provided Milken with assistance [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1376.8799999999999s)]
*  in renewing his long term US residency visa and sought to help him with tax issues. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1381.98s)]
*  Then there's case 2000. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1388.3400000000001s)]
*  In that case, the prime minister is accused of fraud and breach of trust over his alleged [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1390.7s)]
*  attempt to reach a quid pro quo agreement with the publisher of the Yetioth, I don't [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1394.7s)]
*  know how to pronounce that, but a newspaper basically, Arnon Noni Moses, whereby Yetioth [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1402.94s)]
*  would give the prime minister more positive media coverage in exchange for legislation [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1409.66s)]
*  weakening its key rival, the Israel Hion free sheet. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1414.18s)]
*  And then finally, the more serious case is case 4000, also known as the Bizek Walla case. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1421.0600000000002s)]
*  It's the most serious case the prime minister faces in which he is accused of authorizing [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1428.5600000000002s)]
*  regulatory decisions that financially benefited Bizek telecommunications giant shareholder [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1432.6200000000001s)]
*  Saul Elavick by hundreds of millions of shekels. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1439.26s)]
*  In return, Netanyahu allegedly received favorable media coverage from the Walla news site, which [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1443.98s)]
*  of course this guy that engaged in this corruption with him allegedly owns. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1450.0600000000002s)]
*  And the Israeli prime minister in an effort to secure positive coverage for himself and [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1455.5800000000002s)]
*  his family allegedly pushed beneficial regulations for powerful individuals in the media, the [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1458.94s)]
*  outlet reported. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1464.22s)]
*  So this trial is one of the most controversial legal proceedings Israel has faced. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1466.06s)]
*  I think Netanyahu overall is a bad guy aside from his corruption. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1474.06s)]
*  He's a war criminal. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1478.5s)]
*  He is obsessed with power. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1480.02s)]
*  He's a complete nutter narcissist who has, I believe, destroyed the perception of Israel [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1482.1799999999998s)]
*  in the international community because of the fact that he has led the country in its [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1487.3799999999999s)]
*  genocide against Palestinians. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1493.6599999999999s)]
*  But Donald Trump ended his statement by saying that Bibi Netanyahu's trial should be canceled [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1496.04s)]
*  immediately or a pardon given to a great hero. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1500.52s)]
*  I can't stomach it. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1504.52s)]
*  You guys can see it for yourselves, okay? [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1505.8s)]
*  He thinks that all charges should be dropped. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1507.92s)]
*  But what's also really interesting, Cenk, is that the president of Israel, Isaac Herzog, [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1510.6399999999999s)]
*  has stated that a pardon for Bibi is not currently on the table. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1517.0s)]
*  And others in Israel, including the leader of the opposition party, Yair Lapid, says [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1522.16s)]
*  this, with all due respect and gratitude to the president of the United States, he's not [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1529.52s)]
*  supposed to intervene in a legal process of an independent state. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1533.4s)]
*  You guys don't like when a foreign leader intervenes in proceedings in your sovereign [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1540.64s)]
*  country in your independent state. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1546.32s)]
*  Ain't nothing independent about Israel if they're taking our tax dollars, okay? [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1548.36s)]
*  I'm sorry, but they're highly dependent on the United States. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1552.1599999999999s)]
*  I don't think that Trump should have any say in Bibi's corruption charges at all. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1556.28s)]
*  I wanna be clear about that. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1560.84s)]
*  But what's good for the goose is good for the mother f-ing gander. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1562.52s)]
*  But go ahead, Cenk. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1566.96s)]
*  Yeah, no, that is hilarious. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1567.96s)]
*  I can't believe you guys are interfering in our government. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1569.72s)]
*  AIPAC, make them stop. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1572.6s)]
*  I mean, the irony of that is hilarious. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1574.48s)]
*  Okay, now look, credit to Israel, their corruption laws are actually much tougher than ours and [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1578.2800000000002s)]
*  better than ours. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1586.0400000000002s)]
*  So the things that they describe about Netanyahu is Tuesday for an American politician, like [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1588.0400000000002s)]
*  take goodies from donors. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1592.7600000000002s)]
*  Like, wait, how would we survive if we didn't? [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1595.2s)]
*  And then rig the rules so that it's in their benefit. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1599.9s)]
*  Well, that's what we do for Israel. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1604.48s)]
*  So that's illegal in Israel, but we do it for Israel here in America. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1607.3999999999999s)]
*  And for the military industrial complex and the oil companies and all those guys. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1612.36s)]
*  That's why I have the look up shirt, right? [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1616.08s)]
*  Your problems aren't to your left or to your right. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1617.9199999999998s)]
*  Look up, okay? [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1620.4399999999998s)]
*  And in this case, it's the donors, right? [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1621.4399999999998s)]
*  Shoptyt.com, by the way. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1623.84s)]
*  And so, but these are real laws in Israel. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1626.1599999999999s)]
*  It is definitely corruption. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1630.56s)]
*  Of course, Netanyahu did it. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1632.6399999999999s)]
*  Do you think he has moral principles that would prevent him from doing corruption? [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1634.04s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1638.84s)]
*  I mean, no one believes that. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1639.84s)]
*  I don't even think, I mean, maybe some hard right-wing Israelis do, but most of Israel [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1640.84s)]
*  doesn't even believe that. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1644.6399999999999s)]
*  But will they actually prosecute him? [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1647.44s)]
*  I don't know, right? [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1649.48s)]
*  Because right now- [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1651.28s)]
*  They're prosecuting him right now, Cenk. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1652.28s)]
*  He's gonna go to court on Monday. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1653.6s)]
*  Yeah, I hear you, but he's gonna go to prison? [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1654.8799999999999s)]
*  I would be shocked because he's killed so many Palestinians. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1658.72s)]
*  Because of that, he has popularity. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1663.52s)]
*  Because of the corruption and other problems, he's unpopular in a lot of ways in Israel. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1665.76s)]
*  But 80% of Israelis think they haven't gone far enough in Gaza. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1670.28s)]
*  So they like the mayhem and the murder that he committed in Gaza. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1673.96s)]
*  And his main competitor, I mean, Yair Lapid might be from another party, but Naftali Bennett [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1678.16s)]
*  is more likely to win if there's an election. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1682.92s)]
*  And he's also a super hard right-winger who also hates the Palestinians and would never [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1685.8799999999999s)]
*  let them go. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1692.0s)]
*  And it's like thrilled with the oppression and destruction in Gaza. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1693.0s)]
*  So that's why in some ways he's hated, and in other ways he's a national hero for how [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1697.8000000000002s)]
*  he's massacred and slaughtered the Palestinians. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1705.1200000000001s)]
*  So he's gonna go to prison. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1708.04s)]
*  Yeah, makes me sick. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1709.04s)]
*  If he does, I'll be very impressed by the Israeli court system. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1710.04s)]
*  All right, we gotta take a break. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1712.88s)]
*  But when we come back, man, Pete Hegseth went hard today in trashing the leaked intel indicating [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1714.8400000000001s)]
*  that the United States failed in its mission to destroy Iran's nuclear sites. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1721.88s)]
*  I wanna give you some of those videos and more when we come back. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1725.96s)]
*  And we're gonna give you an update on the Senate parliamentarian potentially saving [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1729.16s)]
*  Medicaid. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1735.2800000000002s)]
*  Okay, and Republican senators are not happy about it. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1736.2800000000002s)]
*  I can't wait to get to that story. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1739.68s)]
*  Stick around, we'll be right back. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1741.2s)]
*  All right, lots of comments to get to. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1751.88s)]
*  Let's go to tyt.com. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1760.5600000000002s)]
*  Cenk's left tricep, but Fury says, Levy channeling his inner Anna. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1761.5600000000002s)]
*  Well, it's very kind to Anna, but Gideon Levy doesn't need any of our help in being good. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1765.24s)]
*  Funkin for fun says, my aunt is Jewish in New York and not a fan of Netanyahu. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1772.0400000000002s)]
*  If you think all Jews only care about backing Israel, you're a bigot. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1775.8000000000002s)]
*  See, I agree with that. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1779.0s)]
*  And oftentimes the Republicans and the right wing do that. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1780.8s)]
*  They go, now if you're Jewish, you have to support what Israel's doing in Gaza. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1784.04s)]
*  No, you don't. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1787.96s)]
*  Well, that's not a thing, right? [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1788.96s)]
*  I don't know if they know this, but we're all human beings and we all have different [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1791.36s)]
*  points of view. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1795.2s)]
*  Asil Cito 47 says, whatever happened to the United States standing up for human rights [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1796.2s)]
*  violations? [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1800.4s)]
*  That's what happened, okay? [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1803.4s)]
*  We haven't done that in a long time and we were a better country when we did. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1805.06s)]
*  Now we commit to human rights violations, we finance the human rights violations, and [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1809.56s)]
*  we make excuses for it over and over. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1814.1599999999999s)]
*  But we're dragging Kat with kind of good news. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1815.8799999999999s)]

*  It's like hunting deer in a fenced in area. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1831.12s)]
*  Totally. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1833.96s)]
*  Defenses are obliterated, so they don't have any place to oppose us. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1835.2s)]
*  And we keep bragging about, we went in there and with no opposition at all, dropped a bomb [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1840.64s)]
*  on a target that's super obvious. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1846.08s)]
*  Can I just say, Cenk, real quick, the Ayatollah put out a video today and I do mean the disrespect, [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1848.48s)]

*  Lady D writes in, children are precious no matter where they are born. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1959.1599999999999s)]
*  All children have a right to clean air, food, and water. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1962.12s)]
*  That's of course obviously true unless you're an Israeli and you think asterisks, unless [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1965.32s)]
*  they're Muslim kids. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1970.56s)]
*  And let's be honest, that is their government policy, so don't pretend it isn't. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1972.6799999999998s)]
*  Jeremy Doyle says, Gideon isn't the only Israeli who's been speaking out for a long time. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1976.3999999999999s)]
*  There's Ilyin Pape and Avi Shlem and many others too. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1980.12s)]
*  Yes, there's wonderful moral conscience of Israel inside the country. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1983.52s)]
*  All right, back on to you at the Jank and Anna with you guys. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=1996.32s)]
*  And [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2021.92s)]
*  what's next? [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2046.88s)]
*  Well, Pete Hegseth is not happy with the leak coming out of the Pentagon indicating that [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2048.76s)]
*  maybe the US didn't really succeed in its mission in destroying Iran's nuclear sites. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2055.2000000000003s)]
*  And I wanna give you the details, including one of the most disgusting videos of Lindsey [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2060.32s)]
*  Graham and the bar was high, but he met it today. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2065.9s)]
*  Let's get into it. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2069.36s)]
*  What's really happening is you're undermining the success of incredible B2 pilots and incredible [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2070.36s)]
*  F-35 pilots and incredible refuelers and incredible air defenders who accomplished their mission, [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2076.7599999999998s)]
*  set back a nuclear program in ways that other presidents would have dreamed. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2083.24s)]
*  How about we celebrate that? [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2087.72s)]
*  How about we talk about how special America is, that only we have these capabilities? [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2090.08s)]
*  I think it's too much to ask, unfortunately, for the fake news. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2095.3599999999997s)]
*  I mean, there are definitely some elements of America that are special, if you know what [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2100.2799999999997s)]
*  I mean. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2104.3199999999997s)]
*  This morning, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth chided the media during a press conference [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2105.32s)]
*  at the Pentagon. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2110.96s)]
*  He and others in the Trump administration, of course, are still furious over a leaked [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2112.1600000000003s)]
*  Defense Intelligence Agency report. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2117.8s)]
*  It was a preliminary report that made it appear as though the US strikes on Iran's nuclear [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2120.28s)]
*  sites only set Iran back a few months. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2126.98s)]
*  But again, that was a preliminary report. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2131.3s)]
*  Now, that report was leaked to CNN. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2133.8399999999997s)]
*  And again, it alleged that the US wasn't as successful as the Trump administration would [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2137.48s)]
*  have you believe. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2141.3199999999997s)]
*  Now, here's more from Hegseth in response to that leak. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2142.3199999999997s)]
*  And again, he's definitely not happy with the press in reporting about it. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2146.7799999999997s)]
*  Let's watch. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2150.3599999999997s)]
*  You, and I mean specifically you, the press, specifically you, the press corps. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2151.3599999999997s)]
*  Because you cheer against Trump so hard. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2158.68s)]
*  It's like in your DNA and in your blood to cheer against Trump. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2162.16s)]
*  Because you want him not to be successful so bad. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2166.12s)]
*  You have to cheer against the efficacy of these strikes. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2169.48s)]
*  You have to hope maybe they weren't effective. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2173.04s)]
*  Maybe the way the Trump administration is representative isn't true. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2176.02s)]
*  So let's take half truths, spun information, leaked information, and then spin it. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2178.96s)]
*  In every way we can to try to cause doubt and manipulate the mind, [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2187.04s)]
*  the public mind over whether or not our brave pilots were successful. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2192.08s)]
*  How many stories have been written about how hard it is to, I don't know, [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2198.28s)]
*  fly a plane for 36 hours? [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2202.16s)]
*  Has MSNBC done that story? [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2204.64s)]
*  Has Fox? [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2206.84s)]
*  Have we done the story how hard that is? [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2207.88s)]
*  Have we done it two or three times? [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2209.96s)]
*  Come on, Pete, come on, okay, look. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2211.24s)]
*  I actually understand his rage and I do blame the media, but [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2216.72s)]
*  not in the way that he's blaming the media. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2220.8399999999997s)]
*  So my problem is just because someone from the Pentagon is leaking [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2224.3199999999997s)]
*  a preliminary report, journalists shouldn't just be stenographers [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2229.2s)]
*  who regurgitate it without questioning. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2234.24s)]
*  Okay, wait, why was this leaked to me? [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2237.24s)]
*  And what is the motivation here? [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2239.12s)]
*  And I don't think that they reported on this simply because they hate Trump and [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2241.56s)]
*  they want to see him fail. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2246.24s)]
*  I think they reported on this, A, because the reporters who got the leak felt like, [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2248.0s)]
*  ooh, I'm special, I have a scoop and I'm going to break a story. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2252.72s)]
*  But also, the media doesn't tend to question the motivation or [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2256.24s)]
*  the motivation of the leaker itself, right? [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2261.16s)]
*  And honestly, I do think that leaking a preliminary report before fully [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2264.0s)]
*  investigating the destruction of those nuclear sites is meant to go the US into [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2268.52s)]
*  further war with Iran. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2274.2s)]
*  That's my interpretation of it. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2275.2s)]
*  I'm curious what you think though, Cenk. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2276.72s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you're taking a lot of the words right out of my mouth. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2278.4s)]
*  So first, the stuff like this gets leaked all the time in both [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2280.8s)]
*  administrations, and it's almost always to spur further war. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2284.36s)]
*  And that is the point of the leak is to say, we didn't do enough, [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2288.76s)]
*  we need a bomb more. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2291.84s)]
*  Now, there could be a lot of different factors and [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2293.2400000000002s)]
*  forces within the government that want to leak something like that. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2296.96s)]
*  Could be pro-Israel forces, but it could just be military contractor forces, [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2299.76s)]
*  oil company forces, or just a group of people who are ideologically believe in war. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2303.36s)]
*  And there's a lot of interesting interviews we've done recently. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2308.76s)]
*  I did one during the military parade with Colin Powell's former chief of staff [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2311.4s)]
*  during the Iraq war. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2316.32s)]
*  So he has a lot of expertise in this. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2317.6800000000003s)]
*  He actually literally talked to those guys and [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2319.48s)]
*  knows how they started the Iraq war because he's right in the middle of it. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2322.28s)]
*  And he says, yeah, there are a group of people in the American government and [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2325.76s)]
*  some outside. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2329.0800000000004s)]
*  They tend to be older, and they believe in perpetual war, and [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2330.0800000000004s)]
*  they're constantly pushing the government towards that. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2333.0800000000004s)]
*  So my point is there's a lot of forces who want war, and [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2336.44s)]
*  they usually leak this kind of stuff. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2339.1200000000003s)]
*  And this is really important, guys, it doesn't have to be false. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2341.5600000000004s)]
*  because the intelligence community usually prepares reports that says, well, [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2345.0s)]
*  we might have gotten it. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2349.0400000000004s)]
*  This is the evidence for us actually wiping out their nuclear facilities in [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2350.0400000000004s)]
*  the whole. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2355.04s)]
*  And then they'll have a separate report saying, now, this is our evidence for [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2355.8s)]
*  the fact that we might not have wiped out all of their uranium stock, right? [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2359.64s)]
*  So you can then cherry pick and leak whichever one you like, [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2364.2s)]
*  because almost certainly both exist. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2368.16s)]
*  So the forces for war cherry pick the one that says, [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2370.44s)]
*  we didn't get it all and leak it. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2374.04s)]
*  And then CNN does something that is, I don't know if they know they're being [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2376.24s)]
*  disingenuous or not, but it is disingenuous. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2380.88s)]
*  Because CNN will then say, it's real, our sources are real, and [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2384.28s)]
*  we got this leak from an actual person. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2388.44s)]
*  No, no, no, I'm not in MAGA, I don't believe Trump and Hegseth, etc. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2391.88s)]
*  You don't have to convince me that there's a real report or [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2395.8s)]
*  a real person who gave you the report, right? [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2399.6400000000003s)]
*  But did you ask them, hey, is there another report that says the opposite? [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2402.8s)]
*  Why are you leaking this to me? [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2407.52s)]
*  What is your motivation? [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2409.48s)]
*  Did you talk about the potential motivations for that leak? [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2410.52s)]
*  And the answer is hell no, hell no. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2414.16s)]
*  And if you're wondering why, [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2416.7599999999998s)]
*  another really good interview honestly happened recently, [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2417.96s)]
*  it's on our YouTube channel. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2420.52s)]
*  Tara Palmieri, she worked at ABC, CNN, Politico, etc. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2421.7999999999997s)]
*  And she said, these news organizations are obsessed with access, [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2426.2s)]
*  so they could break news. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2430.7999999999997s)]
*  So they lean towards their sources and protect them, not in terms of, [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2432.96s)]
*  I'm not going to tell you their identity, that's standard. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2438.3599999999997s)]
*  But they frame the story to make their sources look good, and [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2441.0s)]
*  they protect them in other ways. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2445.8s)]
*  So they're not giving you the actual news, [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2449.76s)]
*  they're giving you the news framed to benefit whoever that source is. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2452.2400000000002s)]
*  And in this case, it's almost certainly a source that's pro-war. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2456.96s)]
*  So Trump also attacked the press because I think in the case of Trump, [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2461.0s)]
*  he wants the strikes to be a success. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2465.32s)]
*  He's really proud of the strikes. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2468.08s)]
*  But I think what's more interesting about this whole debacle is that this [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2469.64s)]
*  morning, Hegseth was especially combative with Fox News reporter. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2474.3199999999997s)]
*  Her name is Jennifer Griffin. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2478.7599999999998s)]
*  I actually am not familiar with her. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2481.56s)]
*  I haven't really watched much of her content at all. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2483.16s)]
*  But we'll explain why it's particularly interesting that they had a back and [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2485.8399999999997s)]
*  forth in just a moment. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2491.08s)]
*  But first, let's watch their exchange. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2492.12s)]
*  Do you have certainty that all the highly enriched uranium was inside [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2494.16s)]
*  the Fordow Mountain or some of it because there were satellite photos that showed [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2498.96s)]
*  more than a dozen trucks there two days in advance. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2504.12s)]
*  Are you certain none of that highly enriched uranium was moved? [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2508.08s)]
*  Of course, we're watching every single aspect, but Jennifer, [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2511.2s)]
*  you've been about the worst. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2513.92s)]
*  The one who misrepresents the most intentionally what the president says. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2515.96s)]
*  I'm familiar. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2521.3599999999997s)]
*  I heard about the ventilation shafts on Saturday night. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2523.12s)]
*  And in fact, I was the first to describe the B2 bombers, [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2526.7599999999998s)]
*  the refueling, the entire mission with great accuracy. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2530.72s)]
*  So I take issue with that. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2534.64s)]
*  I appreciate you acknowledging that this is the most successful mission [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2536.08s)]
*  based on operational security that this department has done since you've been here. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2540.56s)]
*  I appreciate that. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2545.48s)]
*  Now, Jennifer Griffin actually came up in conversation on a podcast episode recently. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2546.2s)]
*  And that was actually how I first learned about her. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2554.2799999999997s)]
*  She is a Fox News reporter. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2557.4399999999996s)]
*  She reports out of the Pentagon. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2559.16s)]
*  And if you don't believe me, someone who actually knows her personally, [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2562.2799999999997s)]
*  worked at the same network as her, has a little bit of insight to share. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2566.0s)]
*  Let's watch. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2569.4399999999996s)]
*  So they're all an extension, CNN and all these other, [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2570.96s)]
*  they're all an extension of the intelligence community, [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2574.36s)]
*  being fed this information and given these sources. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2577.44s)]
*  So they can never say a negative thing about them, [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2580.32s)]
*  because then you cut off your sources. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2583.28s)]
*  Jennifer Griffin, as this was all unfolding, [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2585.8s)]
*  and it was clear to me that there are a lot of questions about [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2588.64s)]
*  what was actually in those nuclear sites. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2592.52s)]
*  Because a week earlier, Israel had struck two of them. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2595.4s)]
*  So do you think that Iran just kind of hung out and just got a broom out [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2599.16s)]
*  and cleaned some stuff up and just put the pictures back up on the wall? [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2602.52s)]
*  No, they were empty. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2606.64s)]
*  Jen Griffin is a liar, but also very liberal. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2607.88s)]
*  A true Trump hater, to the point where I complained about her. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2613.52s)]
*  And I really tried not to complain about other people at Fox when I worked there, [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2616.6s)]
*  because I don't like that, all this politics stuff. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2619.52s)]
*  But she was discrediting the channel. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2623.04s)]
*  She was such a Trump hater. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2625.04s)]
*  Boy, you could not touch Jennifer Griffin. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2626.64s)]
*  I don't know what that's about. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2628.8s)]
*  But well, if you have an office in the Pentagon, [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2631.4s)]
*  maybe that's what that's about. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2635.2400000000002s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2636.32s)]
*  I mean, or I don't know. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2637.32s)]
*  And when you have an office in the Pentagon, [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2642.1200000000003s)]
*  you're going to get some details about the B-2 bombers [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2643.92s)]
*  and how the operation was carried out. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2647.4s)]
*  I don't think that you can call yourself a journalist when you have these comfy, [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2650.84s)]
*  cozy ties with the Pentagon, to the point where you literally have an office [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2654.5600000000004s)]
*  within the Pentagon. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2659.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2660.84s)]
*  I feel like there might be a conflict of interest there, [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2661.36s)]
*  but I don't know. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2663.28s)]
*  I'm curious what you think, Cenk. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2663.8s)]
*  Yeah, so I've seen Jennifer Griffin a bunch of times. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2665.0400000000004s)]
*  I never saw anything that aroused my suspicion about her sources or facts. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2668.44s)]
*  But do her sources come from the military industrial complex [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2673.2000000000003s)]
*  and the people pushing for war? [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2678.6400000000003s)]
*  Almost every time. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2680.5600000000004s)]
*  And so she's a Trump hater. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2681.76s)]
*  No, no. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2683.1200000000003s)]
*  My guess is that whenever Trump was opposed to further strikes, [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2684.6800000000003s)]
*  that's when one of her sources would give her a leak [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2688.24s)]
*  about how Trump was wrong and we needed more war. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2692.08s)]
*  And then she would come out and say that, and then Trump would perceive her [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2695.04s)]
*  as a Trump hater. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2698.12s)]
*  But really, that's not the point. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2699.24s)]
*  And she's just a vessel. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2700.9199999999996s)]
*  Like all these so-called reporters aren't really reporters. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2703.64s)]
*  They're messengers, like messenger pigeons. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2707.4399999999996s)]
*  They just pick up a message from a donor class, military industrial complex, [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2711.52s)]
*  Israeli lobbyists, whatever it might be. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2716.88s)]
*  And then they deliver that message to their audience. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2719.4s)]
*  And that's it. They don't put any critical thought into it. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2722.04s)]
*  Hey, why are they doing this? [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2724.6400000000003s)]
*  Should I give some context and analysis? [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2727.2000000000003s)]
*  No, they just talk about like, okay, the big two bombers are like that. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2729.52s)]
*  So that we didn't destroy all the facilities. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2732.1600000000003s)]
*  We gotta go get more and that's what my sources say. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2734.08s)]
*  Very standard stuff. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2736.84s)]
*  And so, okay, and I agree with you on your earlier statement too. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2738.76s)]
*  Look, I don't like the way they're going after her or the press. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2743.2s)]
*  And I don't say that as a toss away. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2748.24s)]
*  I really don't like it because it's done in a way to try to suppress anyone [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2751.08s)]
*  opposing the Trump administration, criticizing the Trump administration. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2756.72s)]
*  Or even exactly what I was going to say, or even questioning the Trump administration. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2761.7599999999998s)]
*  So I hate the way they're doing it. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2766.4399999999996s)]
*  But I do like that they're pushing back against cherry picked intelligence to [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2768.08s)]
*  drive us to war. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2772.68s)]
*  If they stated it, honestly, like the way we are here, [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2774.2s)]
*  I think it would be more popular. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2777.04s)]
*  because then a lot of people on the right and the left in the middle would go, [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2779.0s)]
*  I see they're cherry picking the intelligence like they did in Iraq. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2783.08s)]
*  And I hated that. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2786.96s)]
*  To goad us into war. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2787.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2788.44s)]
*  To goad us into war. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2788.96s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2790.08s)]
*  Otherwise, it just looks like the Trump administration is doing, [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2791.08s)]
*  quite frankly, what they always do, which is just attack journalists and [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2794.48s)]
*  journalism when it's critical of the Trump administration. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2798.3199999999997s)]
*  In many cases, rightly so, obviously. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2802.44s)]
*  Now, putting that aside, I do want to just go to one other video here. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2804.76s)]
*  Because, man, the Warhawks, they're trying to work every single angle to go [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2809.6800000000003s)]
*  to war with Iran. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2815.08s)]
*  And of course, Lindsey Graham, Senator Lindsey Graham, [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2817.48s)]
*  who's never met a war he doesn't love, is one of those figures. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2820.1600000000003s)]
*  And get a load of what he said today, watch. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2823.6s)]
*  The program was obliterated at those three sites, but [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2827.16s)]
*  they still have ambitions. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2831.0s)]
*  I don't know where the 900 pounds of collierage uranium exists, but [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2833.04s)]
*  it wasn't part of the target set. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2837.2799999999997s)]
*  Isn't the real question, have we obliterated their desire to have a nuclear [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2839.24s)]
*  weapon? [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2843.6s)]
*  As long as they desire one, as long as they want to kill all the Jews, [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2844.64s)]
*  you still have a problem on your hands. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2848.52s)]
*  I don't want people to think that the site wasn't severely damaged or [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2850.3199999999997s)]
*  obliterated, it was. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2854.3999999999996s)]
*  But having said that, I don't want people to think the problem is over, [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2856.28s)]
*  because it's not. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2859.44s)]
*  They're going to keep trying this as long as they change, [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2860.52s)]
*  until they change their stated goal. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2863.28s)]
*  Now, will they ever do that? [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2865.48s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2866.6400000000003s)]
*  Let's bomb Iran over their thought crimes. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2869.44s)]
*  What was that? [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2872.8s)]
*  What was that? [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2874.04s)]
*  Yeah. We might have obliterated their actual capability to build [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2875.0800000000004s)]
*  a nuclear weapon. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2879.04s)]
*  I mean, I agree with that. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2880.4s)]
*  But are they still wanting to build nuclear weapons? [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2882.12s)]
*  What do we do to obliterate that? [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2886.0s)]
*  This guy is such a loser, total loser, loves to send other people's [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2889.04s)]
*  kids to war, disgusting. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2892.88s)]
*  Yeah, it's funny, we talked a lot about this, how they should have the NASCAR [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2894.64s)]
*  patches on their suits for which donors they represent. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2898.7599999999998s)]
*  And people might think that Lindsey Graham mainly represents APAC. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2902.84s)]
*  And sure, his interests are very, very often aligned with APAC, and [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2905.44s)]
*  he has taken plenty of money from APAC. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2909.6s)]
*  But he represents the military industrial complex more than anything else. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2911.56s)]
*  He is the senator from defense contractors. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2914.7599999999998s)]
*  He's the senator from Raytheon, right? [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2917.2799999999997s)]
*  So he's like, well, okay, we don't have any excuse to go to war anymore. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2919.24s)]
*  But I'm in favor of perpetual war because it makes my donors really, [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2924.12s)]
*  really rich. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2928.04s)]
*  And they share a couple of crumbs off their table and I'm their bitch. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2929.16s)]
*  So, okay, you know what? [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2931.56s)]
*  I think Iran, someone in Iran might have had an idea that we don't like. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2933.32s)]
*  Yeah, good enough. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2939.4s)]
*  Let's keep going to war against them. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2940.64s)]
*  Okay, come on, preposterous. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2942.8399999999997s)]
*  But there's one other thing that he said in there that I want to draw your [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2944.48s)]
*  attention to. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2947.68s)]
*  So this is another perpetual excuse and it's utter nonsense. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2948.68s)]
*  And yes, I'm saying it's definitely utter nonsense, okay? [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2953.04s)]
*  When they say, well, I mean, they're radios, [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2956.64s)]
*  they want to kill all the Jews, so we have to kill them first. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2958.3199999999997s)]
*  No, no, this whole thing is giant excuse. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2962.2s)]
*  They wrote on a charter this. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2966.48s)]
*  So they said, we're against Israel because they're doing the occupation. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2968.04s)]
*  And we want to kill the Jews. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2973.12s)]
*  I don't even, some of them say it, some of them don't say it. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2975.2799999999997s)]
*  You can find a radical to say anything. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2977.92s)]
*  You can find a radical inside America that says kill all the Jews. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2979.6s)]
*  That doesn't mean you should bomb us, right? [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2982.8s)]
*  And if you say, it's their government said, yeah, they're saber rattling. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2985.12s)]
*  What does the Israeli government say? [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2989.24s)]
*  The Israeli government says we're going to starve the Palestinians and [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2991.24s)]
*  steal their land. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2993.88s)]
*  And then they actually do it. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2995.48s)]
*  So they wrote in a charter that we don't have a right to exist, but [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=2996.84s)]
*  brother, you already do exist. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3000.08s)]
*  And you're blocking the Palestinians from existing. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3001.6800000000003s)]
*  Don't worry about what we actually do. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3004.0s)]
*  Worry about one sentence in a document over there so that we can go to war [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3005.96s)]
*  forever and ever and ever and ever and ever and kill all of them. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3010.4s)]
*  Because they want to in their heads kill us, BS. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3014.56s)]
*  I know a lot of people believe it. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3020.7200000000003s)]
*  I know a lot of people are paranoid about it. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3022.2400000000002s)]
*  My God, they're going to kill us all. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3024.48s)]
*  With what, stones? [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3026.2400000000002s)]
*  They don't even have any planes left, right? [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3027.44s)]
*  No, you're actually killing them. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3029.6800000000003s)]
*  You're worried about their hypothetical counterattacks. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3032.0800000000004s)]
*  No, this is always an excuse for more war and [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3035.5600000000004s)]
*  taking more Muslim land for Israel. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3039.0s)]
*  Big update on the so called big beautiful bill, the tax cut and [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3041.5600000000004s)]

*  All right, we're back. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3054.28s)]
*  Let's do all these super chats first. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3071.5600000000004s)]
*  Anthony McClendon writes in, so [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3075.36s)]
*  Thune won't overrule the parliamentarian. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3076.76s)]
*  Either he's lying, he'll advance to it like Rockefeller in 75 or [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3079.0s)]
*  Humphrey in 66, or he'll fire the parliamentarian like Trent Lott in 2001. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3082.68s)]
*  They fear Dems will do it. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3088.44s)]
*  Have they met the Dems? [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3089.8799999999997s)]
*  But I'll take it. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3090.9199999999996s)]
*  So Tony, we're going to get to that story in a little bit. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3092.04s)]
*  And it is going to be very, very interesting to see what they do with [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3094.44s)]
*  the parliamentarian. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3097.8799999999997s)]
*  So, but hey, look, Keith, at least they're talking about the parliamentarian, [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3099.44s)]
*  which I'm already surprised by. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3103.52s)]
*  So, but we'll explain all that in a minute. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3105.8799999999997s)]

*  When she called an Israeli- [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3125.88s)]
*  That's hilarious, actually. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3127.68s)]
*  Yeah, she called an Israeli mouthpiece a vile individual and [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3129.4s)]
*  that's selling like hotcakes, so that's great. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3132.88s)]

*  All right, so listen guys, thank you for saying that. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3160.96s)]
*  I wonder how the other shows are covering it. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3164.16s)]
*  Are they like Trump stopping the war is bad? [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3166.04s)]
*  We should have continued the war because he has to be bad on everything. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3171.08s)]
*  So I don't know. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3174.3599999999997s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3175.0s)]
*  I mean, look, I actually, I watch other left wing shows, right? [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3175.64s)]
*  I watch breaking points and counterpoints pretty regularly. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3179.7999999999997s)]
*  I think they're doing a good job covering these stories. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3182.92s)]
*  There's more skepticism in regard to whether or [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3188.2799999999997s)]
*  not Trump really wants to avoid a regime change war. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3190.56s)]
*  And the guy is a bit of a wild card, so you never know. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3193.8399999999997s)]
*  Totally, skepticism is highly warranted, right? [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3197.88s)]
*  So, but if, all right, we'll save it for whatever it happens, doesn't matter. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3201.1600000000003s)]

*  So no, I'll tell you the reason why. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3219.6s)]
*  Honestly, it was created by American media so [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3221.92s)]
*  that we could go to war endlessly against Muslim countries. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3226.4s)]
*  One, to help Israel take more Muslim land. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3229.6400000000003s)]
*  Two, so that the defense contractors make literally trillions of extra dollars. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3232.2000000000003s)]
*  Trillions were on the line. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3237.44s)]
*  The oil companies also made a lot of money. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3238.96s)]
*  The bankers speculating on it made a lot of money. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3240.52s)]

*  It's the donor class that is constantly getting you to hate Muslims. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3244.6400000000003s)]
*  You think Muslims are any different than any other human beings? [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3248.28s)]
*  Of course not. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3250.92s)]
*  Of course they're grandmothers who love their grandchildren. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3252.1600000000003s)]
*  They keep saying accountants. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3254.68s)]
*  And they're two billion people that are a quarter of the planet. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3256.56s)]
*  Of course they're like every other human being. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3259.48s)]
*  But American media has brainwashed a lot of American citizens into thinking that [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3261.6s)]
*  they're dark, violent, terrorists, etc. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3265.7999999999997s)]
*  So that Israel can take more of their land and [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3268.16s)]
*  we could invade them and the Raytheon could make more money. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3269.8799999999997s)]
*  All right, YouTube members, Milton Borough writes in, [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3273.3599999999997s)]
*  why do Republicans hate poor people like me? [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3276.04s)]
*  I'm 70 and depend on Medicaid for CPAP supplies and oxygen. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3277.48s)]
*  I can't afford it myself. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3281.2799999999997s)]
*  What do they want me to do? [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3282.8399999999997s)]
*  I mean, look, that's so depressing. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3284.56s)]
*  That's a story we're going to get to. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3286.64s)]
*  You're absolutely right to be concerned. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3288.24s)]
*  And but the simple answer to your question is because they need more tax cuts for [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3290.4s)]
*  the rich, so they have to take it from you. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3294.72s)]
*  And yes, that's disgusting. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3296.84s)]
*  All right, back on TYT, Cenk and Anna and Tulu with you. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3298.48s)]
*  They give to ten memberships on YouTube, really appreciate it. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3323.52s)]
*  That's awesome. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3326.64s)]
*  And we did find out where the spider is in one of the videos. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3327.36s)]
*  That's apparently a nice little Easter egg. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3331.2000000000003s)]
*  I'll tell you about it in upcoming break where I read more of your comments. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3333.6000000000004s)]
*  And by the way, we have a new Senate candidate that has joined the rebellion. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3337.44s)]
*  We're going to tell you about that soon. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3343.48s)]
*  We're going to announce it on the show soon. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3344.76s)]
*  Super exciting. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3346.52s)]
*  So the rebellion pack, check them out. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3348.36s)]
*  We're doing amazing work there in taking back ours. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3350.52s)]
*  All right, Anna, what's next? [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3353.76s)]
*  Well, it's been a while since we've given you a comprehensive update on what's going [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3355.76s)]
*  on with Trump's signature bill to fund the border and also give massive tax cuts to the [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3360.88s)]
*  rich and some to the working class. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3367.6000000000004s)]
*  But nonetheless, there's a lot to get into. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3370.0800000000004s)]
*  So let's do it. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3372.1600000000003s)]
*  Let's get into it. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3372.96s)]
*  Get rid of the giant bills, okay? [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3375.44s)]
*  The omnibus bills, the continuing resolutions and even the big beautiful bill. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3378.7200000000003s)]
*  Why not put that on the floor one at a time? [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3383.6s)]
*  I agree. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3386.0s)]
*  And then that way, you can go to your representative or your senators and say, [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3387.44s)]
*  why did you vote for that? [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3393.28s)]
*  Right now, they can say, well, Theo, I had to vote for it. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3394.88s)]
*  I had a pay raise for soldiers, right? [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3398.2400000000002s)]
*  They literally will put a pay raise for soldiers in every freaking bill, [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3400.48s)]
*  giant bill, so that if you vote against it, you have to go back home and watch TV ads that say, [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3404.96s)]
*  he voted against a pay raise for the soldiers. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3411.04s)]
*  Right, even though he may have voted for 90 other amazing things on the bill, right? [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3413.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3419.12s)]
*  Libertarian Congressman Thomas Massey is already a hard no vote on Trump's so-called big, [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3421.12s)]
*  beautiful bill. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3428.88s)]
*  That's the tax cut and border funding bill that he is attempting to get passed [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3429.92s)]
*  through Congress. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3434.88s)]
*  But now that the Senate is drafting their own version of the legislation, Massey might be [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3435.84s)]
*  finding himself in the company of other GOP lawmakers in the House who intend to vote no. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3442.08s)]
*  Now, why is that? [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3448.56s)]
*  Well, there are GOP moderates in blue states, for instance, [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3449.52s)]
*  who think that the Senate bill cuts into the social safety net far too much. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3452.7200000000003s)]
*  And then there are the deficit hawks in the House Freedom Caucus. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3457.6800000000003s)]
*  That's the more right wing contingent in the Republican Party that has issues with spending. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3461.04s)]
*  They claim that they're genuinely worried about the country's debt, even though they are usually [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3468.88s)]
*  okay with the massive tax cuts, which are really the heart of the problem. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3474.0s)]
*  But nonetheless, the Washington Post reports that for too many House Republicans, [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3477.04s)]
*  the legislation in the Senate looks unrecognizable, meaning it's too different [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3483.36s)]
*  from what the House passed and no longer adheres to the hard fought compromises [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3488.96s)]
*  lawmakers in the lower chamber secured just a month ago. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3494.32s)]
*  Now, the Senate version, by the way, does add even more to our national debt. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3498.7200000000003s)]
*  The Congressional Budget Office found that the House passed legislation [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3504.32s)]
*  would add $3.3 trillion to the national debt over 10 years when factoring in interest costs [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3507.92s)]
*  and effects on the wider economy. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3514.56s)]
*  The Senate's version could add far more. The upper chamber's tax provisions are [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3517.12s)]
*  hundreds of billions of dollars more expensive. And that's according to the [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3522.16s)]
*  Joint Committee on Taxation. Now, it's hard to get into too many specifics because [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3526.16s)]
*  in the Senate right now, they're going through the process. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3532.48s)]
*  And in the Senate, you have someone known as the Senate parliamentarian [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3534.96s)]
*  who will strike down provisions within the bill if the Republicans are attempting to pass it through [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3538.88s)]
*  reconciliation or a simple majority, meaning only 51 senators would be necessary to pass [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3545.84s)]
*  the legislation. There is a legislative filibuster in the Senate that requires bills to pass with [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3550.88s)]
*  60 out of 100 votes. But through the reconciliation process, you can do it with a simple majority. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3556.08s)]
*  You just need the Senate parliamentarian to sign on to the provisions. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3562.88s)]
*  But the current version of the Senate bill also includes deeper cuts to Medicaid, [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3567.2000000000003s)]
*  which some Republicans in the House argue will negatively impact rural hospitals in their states. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3573.12s)]
*  So they were trying to find a workaround for that. Now, Capitol Police actually ended up, [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3578.24s)]
*  let's take a look at this video, detaining a group of peaceful protesters [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3583.2799999999997s)]
*  who were protesting the proposed cuts to Medicaid, including several people in wheelchairs. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3588.08s)]
*  They ended up getting arrested, which was not a great sight to see. Putting people in wheelchairs [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3594.0s)]
*  under arrest is kind of lame, to say the least. But nonetheless, [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3600.24s)]
*  I wanna give you some more details, including the fact that as written, the Senate bill would cut [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3605.3599999999997s)]
*  Medicaid spending by more than $900 billion over a decade. But then the Senate parliamentarian came [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3610.08s)]
*  in and she's like, nah, you can't do that. I'm gonna strike down this provision. Now, [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3618.24s)]
*  Senate Republicans are gonna try to find a workaround because they really wanna cut into [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3623.4399999999996s)]
*  the social safety net. I mean, they jump in it. We'll see if they're able to find a workaround [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3627.44s)]
*  that will sit well with the Senate parliamentarian. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3633.36s)]
*  But nonetheless, Elizabeth McDonough, the parliamentarian, said several of the measures [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3637.2000000000003s)]
*  in the legislation that would provide hundreds of billions of dollars in savings could not be [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3642.64s)]
*  included in the legislation in their current form. They include one that would crack down on [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3650.0s)]
*  strategies that many states have developed to obtain more federal Medicaid funds. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3656.32s)]
*  Senators from several states that heavily rely on a tax maneuver to finance their Medicaid programs [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3661.04s)]
*  have said they will not vote for the legislation until it is modified, [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3667.84s)]
*  citing risks to rural hospitals. All states, by the way, but one, use this loophole to some degree. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3672.0800000000004s)]
*  By the way, the Senate parliamentarian also struck down other parts of the bill that [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3678.32s)]
*  we don't like, including cuts to SNAP, meaning the food stamp program for the needy. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3682.24s)]
*  So just think about the framing by the Republicans here, right? [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3689.2s)]
*  The framing is we want to give tax cuts that, for the most part, disproportionately benefit [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3694.4799999999996s)]
*  the wealthy. Now, working class Americans also get an extended tax break. Actually, they want [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3701.6s)]
*  to make the tax breaks for the working class dating back to 2017 permanent. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3706.8s)]
*  So it's not like the working class gets nothing, but the rich disproportionately benefit from the [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3711.76s)]
*  tax cuts. And then on top of that, in order to partially, barely pay for a minuscule portion of [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3716.7200000000003s)]
*  the tax cuts, Republicans are trying to cut from the social safety net. But the parliamentarian [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3723.6800000000003s)]
*  came in and basically said, no, you can't do that with the food stamps. No, you can't do that with [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3728.5600000000004s)]
*  Medicaid. We'll see what the Republicans come up with next. But Cenk, you and I are notorious [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3732.56s)]
*  for thinking that the Senate parliamentarian and the legislative filibuster shouldn't exist. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3739.92s)]
*  Have you changed your mind at all, given this strike back from the parliamentarian when it [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3745.44s)]
*  comes to the social safety net? No, I don't believe in the filibuster. I believe that democracy [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3750.4s)]
*  matters and if you have the majority, you should be able to pass bills. And that people should be [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3755.7599999999998s)]
*  careful about how they vote because if you give the majority to one party in all these branches, [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3759.84s)]
*  then they will pass their agenda. And so that's voting should matter. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3765.2000000000003s)]
*  So I'll come back to the parliamentarian in a second. But look, to the heart of the bill, [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3770.7200000000003s)]
*  there's two issues here. One is, it was the most important fact on the House version of the bill, [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3774.48s)]
*  Medicaid is snapped, get cut by 1.1 trillion. And that is the exact same number that is added [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3780.32s)]
*  in tax cuts for people making above $500,000. So the people making about $500,000 a year, [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3786.48s)]
*  do they really need an extra $1.1 trillion? Or should we keep 10 million people on Medicaid? [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3792.72s)]
*  So when we take the 10 million people off, what's going to happen? [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3798.72s)]
*  A lot of people are gonna die. That's not a joke. The reason they're on Medicaid is because [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3801.6s)]
*  they're poor and they can't afford health insurance and they can't afford health care. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3806.0s)]
*  So if they can't afford it and they get kicked off of Medicaid and they get sick, [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3810.64s)]
*  that's it, they're gonna die. It's not complicated, guys. And it's not hyperbole. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3816.24s)]
*  So you twist your ankle, you go to the emergency room, they'll take your house. Okay, I got it. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3822.16s)]
*  But if you have cancer or your daughter has cancer and you don't have insurance, you're dead. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3826.56s)]
*  So that's what they're doing because people making above $500,000 a year need an extra [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3834.32s)]
*  $1.1 trillion. But now, by the way, Bloated Ego, one of our members, [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3840.4s)]
*  wrote in on tyt.com, a bill shouldn't be a potential death sentence. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3845.28s)]
*  And this one kind of is. And there's that kind of, there's been analysis already, [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3850.1600000000003s)]
*  we'll see what the real number is. But then it might kill up to 70,000 people a year. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3854.56s)]
*  But the people making above half a million dollars a year need another $1.1 trillion. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3859.6800000000003s)]
*  Do they? Do they really need it that much? Come on, guys. I mean, this is barbaric. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3865.92s)]
*  And if you wonder why I wouldn't vote Republican, this is why. They always serve the rich above [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3872.64s)]
*  all else. So now they say, no, no, no, no, we have another priority. We gotta balance the budget. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3880.48s)]
*  My ass you do. They never balance the budget. If you think Republicans balance the budget, [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3885.2799999999997s)]
*  you're a giant sucker. It never happened in our lifetime. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3890.24s)]
*  Last Republican president to leave office with a balanced budget was Dwight Eisenhower, okay? [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3894.7999999999997s)]
*  So in this case, the House version adds 3.3 trillion. The Senate version is gonna add a lot [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3899.9199999999996s)]
*  more than 3.3 trillion. And they're like, it keeps saying, and it's so comical, [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3905.44s)]
*  because mainstream media goes along with it. And they keep quoting all the congressmen and senators. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3910.8799999999997s)]
*  They're like, I don't know how we could possibly balance it. Where would we ever find the money? [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3915.92s)]
*  And I'm like, the tax cuts? If you just take the tax cuts out, [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3920.88s)]
*  you could actually balance it pretty easily. But the press is like, I'm flummoxed too. Golly gee, [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3925.6s)]
*  where would we get the money? The tax cuts, that's where you would get the money. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3932.32s)]
*  So I had Ro Khanna on here last night. Check out that interview on YouTube. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3937.36s)]
*  He found $12 trillion you can cut without cutting anything for Medicaid, [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3941.2s)]
*  Medicare, Social Security, SNAP, none of that. And it's to oil company subsidies. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3947.04s)]
*  It's to defense contractor waste, fraud, and abuse. It's tax cuts for the rich for no reason. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3953.12s)]
*  Tax cuts for corporations for no reason, etc. So there's a way to do this. They just don't wanna [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3960.08s)]
*  do it, cuz they wanna give all the money to their donors. That's why you gotta look up. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3965.04s)]
*  That's where the problems are, the donor class. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3968.64s)]
*  Yep, now the other points of contention for the House versus the Senate is the Republicans in [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3972.08s)]
*  the House wanted to lift or raise the so-called SALT tax. That's the federal deduction when it [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3978.64s)]
*  comes to state and local taxes. But the Senate's not buying it. And so now the House Republicans [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3986.16s)]
*  are like, we're not gonna vote yes on the legislation if we don't get an increase on [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3994.08s)]
*  that SALT cap. The House, by the way, would raise the cap to $40,000 for taxpayers earning no more [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=3998.48s)]
*  than half a million dollars a year. The Senate did away with the deal entirely, leaving the deduction [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4005.7599999999998s)]
*  untouched at $10,000. So there is gonna be a battle when it comes to these provisions. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4012.24s)]
*  There's also gonna be a battle in regard to what the Senate parliamentarian should be allowed to [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4018.72s)]
*  strike down provision-wise in the final bill. It's really interesting to hear Republicans go after [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4025.7599999999998s)]
*  the parliamentarian accusing her of being woke, which is just like the go-to feedback or insult [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4034.0s)]
*  that Republicans like to jump into whenever they don't like something that's being done. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4042.7999999999997s)]
*  I don't think this has anything to do with wokeness. I think this has to do with the [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4047.28s)]
*  fact that the Senate is intentionally structured in a way to ensure that it's the place where bills [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4050.5600000000004s)]
*  go to die. So if you want a simple majority, you really need to question the structure of the [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4056.1600000000003s)]
*  Senate and whether or not some reforms need to be made. But look, we don't know what the final bill [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4062.32s)]
*  is gonna look like. Republicans wanted to get this bill passed ahead of the July 4th holiday. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4066.8s)]
*  It seems unlikely to happen at this point, but you never know. A lot of Republicans end up folding. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4073.68s)]
*  So we'll see what happens, but we'll keep you updated and posted as this develops. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4080.16s)]
*  Yeah, so look, no matter where the parliamentarian lands or where they land on how many [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4083.44s)]
*  hundreds of millions of dollars they're gonna cut from Medicaid and how much of the salt deduction [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4088.56s)]
*  they're gonna keep in, etc. Again, Tom Massey's right. In a different clip, he explained, look, [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4093.6s)]
*  these guys in the Republican Party that pretend to complain, I'm gonna vote. The moderate Republicans, [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4100.88s)]
*  so-called moderate, they're not moderate Republicans. But the ones that call themselves [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4106.56s)]
*  moderate in the House, they say, I'm gonna vote against it if you don't put more of a salt [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4110.0s)]
*  deduction or this or that. He's like, no, they're not. He's like, at the end of the day, all their [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4114.400000000001s)]
*  other Republicans are gonna vote for whatever bill is put in front of them. So he's absolutely [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4120.0s)]
*  right. That's exactly what's happened. It's fake theater, my whole life covering politics for over [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4125.52s)]
*  25 years. There's always a fake fight between the Republicans. I wanna cut, I wanna cut more. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4131.120000000001s)]
*  Don't talk about the tax cuts, don't talk about the tax cuts, right? So this whole thing plays out. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4136.56s)]
*  They land on a number. And what is the same in every bill is a giant tax, a multi, multi-trillion [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4140.320000000001s)]
*  dollar tax cut for the rich, giant additions to the deficit and the debt. And then the next time [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4147.92s)]
*  around, what drives me crazy, Ana, is mainstream media will then go, now the Republicans say they [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4154.64s)]
*  will care a lot about the deficit. So I'm like, come on, how many times can they do that lie, [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4160.160000000001s)]
*  add three, four, five trillion dollars to the deficit? [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4165.76s)]
*  And then you still parrot their talking points as if they care about the deficit [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4168.64s)]
*  when they're the number one party by a landslide in adding to the deficit. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4172.72s)]
*  Right, I mean, infinite. They will continue doing it. They will continue to pretend like [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4178.4800000000005s)]
*  Republicans care about the deficit. Their behavior certainly doesn't prove that. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4184.64s)]
*  They want the tax cuts. And trying to justify the tax cuts by cutting away at the measly social [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4188.88s)]
*  safety debt that we currently have is pretty pathetic. And I don't know how well that's [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4196.8s)]
*  gonna play. If I were a Democratic politician, I would just go on the campaign trail and I would [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4200.72s)]
*  repeat incessantly. The Republican Party has no problem spending tens of billions of dollars [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4208.240000000001s)]
*  on bombs, to bomb nuclear sites in foreign countries. There's no debate about it. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4216.64s)]
*  But they wanna cut nearly a trillion dollars from the social safety net that we have in this country. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4222.400000000001s)]
*  So your tax dollars don't actually go to benefit your fellow Americans. There's always nickel and [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4228.8s)]
*  diming when it comes to that. But when it comes to funding bombs, no problem with that. So again, [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4234.64s)]
*  we'll see what happens. But for now, we gotta take a break. When we come back, we'll talk a little [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4240.8s)]
*  bit about the absolute panic that has continued to ensue in regard to New York City's mayoral [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4244.64s)]
*  candidate, Zoran Mamdami. And I can't wait to get to that story. There's also some AOC [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4251.84s)]
*  derangement syndrome that we gotta get into. So stick around, we'll be right back. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4258.08s)]
*  What contributions to the progressive cause are you most proud of? [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4268.96s)]
*  I mean, I don't have super high aspirations for a singular role that I can play in the movement or [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4274.64s)]
*  anything. I try to present myself as what I think that I am, which is a progressive man who is driven [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4279.4400000000005s)]
*  by a, I think, well interrogated and well organized system of values that I try to stay consistent on. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4287.2s)]
*  And I demonstrate that that's the sort of life that a person can lead and be successful and be [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4294.48s)]
*  happy and all of that. And that should not need to be done. But there are so many people on the [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4299.36s)]
*  right that are trying to push men in the opposite direction that I wanna be able to do that along [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4304.0s)]
*  the way. If I can get people to care about some topics that they wouldn't necessarily care about, [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4308.08s)]
*  or that for some men they might think that's not a topic that they should be focused on, [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4312.64s)]
*  that's definitely something that I relish doing. And along the way, I mean, we've been able to [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4317.76s)]
*  introduce people to a lot of candidates. That's been a big part of what we've done. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4323.280000000001s)]
*  Not all of them necessarily got an office, probably most of them did not. And a lot of them, [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4329.84s)]
*  you might not even remember their names. But it was great to be able to provide people the platform [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4334.88s)]
*  where they had the chance of making a difference. We see AOC and all that, [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4339.2s)]
*  but there's been a lot of great people along the way. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4343.84s)]
*  I need the other shows, the NPR. They are so quick to decide that they know what this building [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4399.76s)]
*  means today. The one thing that I hate that politicians do, they talk about the people they [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4405.36s)]
*  should be talking to. Do they have any idea that they're their establishment and that they're [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4411.2s)]
*  hated, or do they not realize that at all? People are so deeply in their little universe. I think [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4415.5199999999995s)]
*  it's very easy to not really question what you're doing. Voters have a right to ask questions of any [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4421.5199999999995s)]
*  nominee, whether they're independent, Republican or Democrat. The system is [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4427.28s)]
*  lawfully that suppresses competition. How's the year 2024? And we're still like, [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4431.599999999999s)]
*  maybe they'll talk about it. How is that? At one level, it's like, [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4437.12s)]
*  what we're talking about now. You're like, it's 2024. And that's always been the critique, [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4441.679999999999s)]
*  that your critique of us is, well, you guys give good speeches, you put out good tweets, [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4446.0s)]
*  but you're not wielding actual power. Now we're starting to. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4450.32s)]

*  All right, back on T Y T, Jen Canana with you guys. More news. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4516.64s)]
*  More news indeed. The panic over Zoran Mandani, the would be New York City Mayor, [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4532.8s)]
*  continues. And honestly, it's entertaining to say the least. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4541.200000000001s)]
*  But some people are willing to put some real money behind defeating him in the [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4544.72s)]
*  general election. So we got to get into it. Let's do it. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4548.64s)]
*  This guy makes AOC look like a moderate. He wants government run grocery stores, [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4551.2s)]
*  plans to make public buses free, is pledging to freeze rent prices and wants to borrow [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4556.8s)]
*  $70 billion for more affordable housing. Unless rich New Yorkers band together, [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4561.92s)]
*  donate a lot of money and create a groundswell for a viable alternative to Mom, Donnie. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4567.84s)]
*  Another great American city is gonna swirl down the drain. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4572.88s)]
*  Wow, what way to say the quiet part out loud, Laura Ingraham, like, oh, [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4578.48s)]
*  us rich people are really worried about this Zoran Mandami guy. We got to do something about [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4583.92s)]
*  it. We rich people need to band together. Now look, Laura Ingraham has joined the chorus [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4589.04s)]
*  of Republicans and corporate Democrats that are absolutely panicking about New York City [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4594.5599999999995s)]
*  mayoral candidate Zoran Mamdani and his victory over Andrew Cuomo in the New York City mayoral [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4601.04s)]
*  race. Now the general election hasn't happened yet, but it does appear that he's poised to win. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4608.24s)]
*  And so Laura Ingraham explicitly calling on rich New Yorkers to come together to take him down [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4613.44s)]
*  really tells you everything you need to know about why certain candidates tend to get targeted, [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4620.0s)]
*  smeared, and destroyed much like Senator Bernie Sanders was when he was running for president. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4626.32s)]
*  Now, I wanna show you a little more. So there's a lot more to get to, [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4633.759999999999s)]
*  including what Bill Ackman is gonna try to do to defeat him. But before we get to any of that, [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4640.4s)]
*  Cenk, initial thoughts. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4645.2s)]
*  Yeah, I mean that intro by Laura Ingraham is for the ages. Because I mean, [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4646.639999999999s)]
*  she doesn't realize how funny that is. She's like, this guy wants to do affordable housing [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4653.12s)]
*  and free buses for the masses. Rich people have to band together to make sure this doesn't happen. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4659.2s)]
*  You're just saying it, right? You know that, right? You're on air. You're telling, saying, [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4668.32s)]
*  hey, Rich, let's make sure that the middle class and the poor don't get anything. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4673.360000000001s)]
*  And this son of a bitch looks like he's looking out for the average guy. Let's band together, [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4678.96s)]
*  Rich. Okay, thank you. Thank you for the confession, Laura. We appreciate it. Bill Ackman's [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4683.52s)]
*  confession is coming up in a little bit. But we're asking you guys, are they gonna be successful? [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4688.72s)]
*  Because look, on the live chat on YouTube, we're asking whether MAGA is gonna be successful in [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4694.08s)]
*  taking down Azor on Mamdani. And you guys are good and optimistic, 79% saying no. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4698.08s)]
*  On tyt.com, we're asking, do you think the establishment will be able to take down Mamdani [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4705.2s)]
*  in the general election in New York City? And I'm curious about that as well. Because what we have [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4711.12s)]
*  here is a unique situation, Ana, where we have radical right who's like, Muslim, terrorists, [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4716.8s)]
*  hate them, Sharia law, what an insanity, stuff like that. In cooperation with and in coalition [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4723.2s)]
*  with establishment Republicans and establishment Democrats. And so they're all unified against [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4730.96s)]
*  them, which makes you wanna root for them even more, right? And so will they be able to spend [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4738.0s)]
*  enough money, do enough propaganda, control the media enough to be able to defeat them in [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4743.76s)]
*  the general election? Well, that's another part of the story. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4748.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, and by the way, I mean, we can't discount the media's involvement in all of this because [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4751.68s)]
*  Bill Lander, who was the progressive candidate in the mayoral race, was actually on Jake Tapper's [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4758.24s)]
*  show on CNN, of course, to discuss Mamdani's win. And Tapper asked about Mamdani's alleged [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4763.68s)]
*  anti-Semitism. Okay, so he wants the Palestinian people to not be slaughtered. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4774.32s)]
*  He wants them to be treated with equality and respect. And apparently, if you have those [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4782.719999999999s)]
*  beliefs, you're automatically considered an anti-Semite, especially if you happen to be Muslim. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4787.44s)]
*  But let's get to Bill Ackman because Bill Ackman is real scurred and he's willing to do something [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4792.24s)]
*  about it. He's willing to put big bucks behind essentially defeating [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4797.92s)]
*  Mamdani in the general election. So he's vowed to back a challenger to Zoran Mamdani [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4802.56s)]
*  to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars. In a 1500 word post on X, [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4809.68s)]
*  Ackman ranted about how dangerous he thinks that Mamdani is. He says, I awoke this morning [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4816.96s)]
*  gravely concerned about New York City. Socialism has no place in the economic capital of our [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4824.88s)]
*  country. The ability for New York City to offer services for the poor and needy, let alone the [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4830.64s)]
*  average New Yorker, is entirely dependent on New York City being a business-friendly environment [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4836.4800000000005s)]
*  and a place where wealthy residents are willing to spend 183 days and assume the associated tax [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4842.64s)]
*  burden. Unfortunately, both have already started making arrangements for the exits. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4850.24s)]
*  I think Ackman actually makes a really great point. When I think about prosperity for the [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4857.36s)]
*  working class, I really do think about Wall Street. And when I think about socialism, [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4862.48s)]
*  I also think about Wall Street and bailouts. Cenk, back to you. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4867.5199999999995s)]
*  Cenk Riegel Yeah, so again, saying the quiet part out loud, [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4870.88s)]
*  he's saying, I am going to spend hundreds of millions of dollars along with my rich friends [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4875.92s)]
*  to buy this seat. Thank you for the confession. Okay, I appreciate it. So then now New York, [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4881.04s)]
*  you've got a choice. Are you going to let really rich people on Wall Street buy the election [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4887.92s)]
*  so that all the costs are put on you and they get a free ride? [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4893.599999999999s)]
*  So Ackman has two reasons why he's so animated by Zora and Mamdani. One, he's a giant bigot [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4898.88s)]
*  and racist. So if he sees someone that's Muslim, and in this case, Mamdani happens to be Indian [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4904.48s)]
*  from Uganda. And so he looks at him, he doesn't bow down to Israel, terrorist, right? When in [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4912.639999999999s)]
*  reality, Bill Ackman is pro genocide. So he's much, much closer to a terrorist. Well, it's not even [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4922.16s)]
*  close. Mamdani hates terrorism and is not at all anti-Semitic. And he wants peace for Israel and [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4928.16s)]
*  Palestine, but Ackman doesn't want that. Ackman is pro slaughter. And so he's saying, I want more [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4934.08s)]
*  of a slaughterhouse in Gaza. And this guy, I know he's the mayor of New York, but it doesn't affect [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4940.5599999999995s)]
*  anything, but it bothers me. He's not even pro genocide, it bothers me, okay? I'm sorry, [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4944.96s)]
*  are you bothered, billionaire? I'm sorry, are you bothered that we're not doing enough genocides [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4950.8s)]
*  for your liking? And this is a sick state of our so-called democracy, where oligarchs [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4956.0s)]
*  feel no pressure at all not to say these things out loud and in public. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4962.64s)]
*  And they're, I will be buying this election on behalf of Israel and my other rich friends [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4966.88s)]
*  on Wall Street here in New York. And that's the second reason why Ackman's so, [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4972.24s)]
*  but that's why Mamdani has become this target for all of the most toxic people in the country. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4976.24s)]
*  Because he animates the rich too, like the super rich that love to corrupt the government. Not the [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4984.88s)]
*  super rich that don't corrupt the government, they're different categories, okay? But people [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4990.96s)]
*  who are used to buying political seats like Ackman, they're like, we didn't even buy this one. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=4994.88s)]
*  And he's saying that he would raise corporate taxes for New York City from around 7% to around [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5000.96s)]
*  11%, an extra 4% are due to cry. Fellow billionaires, we've got a terrorist here looking [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5005.92s)]
*  to raise our taxes. And he's not even in favor of genocide. No, we will be defeating him with all [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5015.6s)]
*  of our money, we will purchase the seat. Well, I hope that money gets shoved straight up your [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5022.240000000001s)]
*  ass. Now, rhetorically, metaphorically, okay, not literally, so don't get all upset and say, [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5027.4400000000005s)]
*  I would have spent hundreds of millions of dollars trying to defeat the young tax. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5034.96s)]
*  They are anti-genocide, I despise them. And I want more tax cuts. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5040.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah, we got it, billionaire Sir Topham Hatt, mother effort, we got it. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5046.400000000001s)]
*  Okay, get your phone ready so you can scroll through Twitter as I go through the rest of [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5050.240000000001s)]
*  this story, because I'm not gonna go back to you for a while. But let me just say in regard to [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5054.320000000001s)]
*  shoving money up his ass, listen, Bill Ackman's a wealthy man. And wealthy people love to do all [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5057.76s)]
*  sorts of weird new wave health treatments. Who knows what kind of expensive enemas that guy is [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5063.6s)]
*  up to. But nonetheless, let me give you some more details about how he originally felt depressed [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5069.04s)]
*  about Mom Donnie. But now he says he's feeling optimistic about the situation. Now, why is that? [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5074.72s)]
*  The good news, he writes, is that there are other charismatic, intelligent, articulate, handsome, [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5080.88s)]
*  charming, young, yet more experienced and importantly, more centrist politicians who [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5087.04s)]
*  are New York residents eligible for office. Okay, well, why didn't they run? They didn't run. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5094.4s)]
*  He says there are also extremely talented members of the New York business community [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5100.16s)]
*  who could be superb mayors. Bloomberg being the reference standard from the past. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5105.5199999999995s)]
*  Wow, this guy's super out of touch. And look, he plans to help bankroll any so-called centrists [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5112.96s)]
*  that choose to challenge Mom Donnie. Importantly, he writes, there are hundreds of millions of [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5119.2s)]
*  dollars of capital available to back a competitor to Mom Donnie that can be put together overnight. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5125.28s)]
*  Believe me, I am in the text strings and the WhatsApp groups so that a great alternative [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5132.4s)]
*  candidate won't spend any time raising funds. If someone is ready to raise their hand, [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5139.5199999999995s)]
*  I will take care of the fundraising. I'm sure he will. Now, he goes on and on and on about how [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5146.4s)]
*  it would be a great opportunity for a challenger to essentially build name recognition and be a [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5152.4s)]
*  hero for the Democratic Party. And by the way, the type of candidate that he's talking about, [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5158.4s)]
*  dime a dozen. Okay, centrist Democrats, dime a dozen. Corporate Democrats, dime a dozen. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5164.96s)]
*  I think what you're experiencing right now with the rise of Mom Donnie is a rejection of the [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5169.839999999999s)]
*  types of, honestly, policies that both corporate Republicans and corporate Democrats have been [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5176.24s)]
*  championing. I think they're sick. American people are sick of being nickel and dimed, [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5181.599999999999s)]
*  and they want a better system. They want to see an end to the ever growing wealth inequality in [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5185.76s)]
*  this country. And so when you have someone who focuses heavily on economic policies, of course, [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5192.88s)]
*  he's gonna be incredibly appealing to the people of New York City, which has an extremely high [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5199.44s)]
*  cost of living. Now, he, meaning Ackman, actually has someone superb in mind for a write-in campaign, [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5204.56s)]
*  but said that since he's a Trump supporter, his public endorsement would probably hurt the candidate. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5213.120000000001s)]
*  So he's waiting for someone else to make the first move. And his fellow rich New Yorkers, [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5218.8s)]
*  meanwhile, are equally concerned and already scheming with their own plans. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5223.76s)]
*  So Semaphore reported on Wednesday that many others in the city's business community are [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5228.88s)]
*  considering shifting their support from Cuomo to Eric Adams. And according to New York's David [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5234.08s)]
*  Freelander, several leaders in the real estate and business world had a group phone call to discuss [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5242.08s)]
*  what to do after Mom Donnie's victory. So make no mistake about it, these people definitely want to [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5250.08s)]
*  destroy Mom Donnie's chances of winning in the general election. It remains to be seen whether [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5257.6s)]
*  or not they'll succeed. But money talks, and I am a little bit concerned. And all sorts of tricks [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5262.88s)]
*  have been played in the past that unfortunately have worked. Yesterday we talked about upstate New [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5268.400000000001s)]
*  York. There was a socialist who won a local race, at least the first round, and then lost in the [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5273.28s)]
*  general because the Democrat challenging this individual decided to run as an independent. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5278.56s)]
*  Now, in this case, Cuomo appears to have dropped out of the race entirely, which is a good sign. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5282.96s)]
*  But we'll see if Bill Ackman and the rest of the people panicking about Mom Donnie will find a [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5288.56s)]
*  strategy that will be successful. Cenk. Yeah, they're thinking of doing a writing candidate, [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5293.6s)]
*  which is harder. But people have won as a writing candidate before, especially if you pour a lot of [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5299.12s)]
*  money into it. And some of the Democratic donors poured a lot of money into having Joe Biden [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5303.68s)]
*  needlessly win the New Hampshire primary as a writing candidate last time around. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5308.72s)]
*  And so maybe they can bust up the money. And they have a secret weapon I'll get to in a second. But [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5313.36s)]
*  more confessions that I like. He's like, I'm not gonna tell you the candidate I prefer, [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5318.32s)]
*  but we'll pick him and then I'll pretend that I had nothing to do with it. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5322.96s)]
*  You know you're saying things in public, right? So you just said you're a Trump supporting billionaire [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5326.96s)]
*  who will pick the Democratic candidate and then pretend he didn't. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5334.0s)]
*  Yep. You just said it. And in the post, you talked about hundreds of millions of dollars. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5337.28s)]
*  And then we'll take the billionaire money, Democrat and Republican, doesn't matter, [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5345.679999999999s)]
*  they're all part of the uniparty establishment, etc. And then we'll use it to try to defeat a [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5349.36s)]
*  person that's trying to represent the average man, cuz we hate the average man. You know you're [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5353.44s)]
*  saying things in public, right? He didn't say he hates the average man that's in between the lines. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5357.84s)]
*  And all this about Bill Ackman is my opinion. You can form any opinion you like, [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5362.0s)]
*  maybe you could read his post on your own and say, my God, I love this. Finally, [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5366.96s)]
*  somebody's standing up for billionaires. Now, when he says it and Ana says it that these, [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5373.12s)]
*  there's so many candidates we could have to run here. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5378.64s)]
*  It's true because the reason there are diamond dozen is because they're all corporate robots [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5381.68s)]
*  off the Bill Ackman and billionaire assembly line. They're like, okay, will you do what we want? Yes, [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5385.36s)]
*  yes, yes, yes, yes. Will you do anything to help the average person? No, no, no, [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5390.8s)]
*  doesn't matter. It's a good assembly line. Buttigieg and everybody else just get news, [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5395.36s)]
*  and keep going, keep going. Mitch McConnell, whoever, it doesn't matter, they're all corporate [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5399.679999999999s)]
*  robots. And so lastly, you guys are a little bit more optimistic than I am. I wanted to see how [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5403.28s)]
*  optimistic you are. Will the establishment be able to defeat Mamdani in the general election? [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5409.92s)]
*  And you guys say 86 to 14, no. And I hope you're right and keep voting to it.com. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5415.759999999999s)]
*  And so the reason why I'm a little worried and what I want to give you guys a heads up about [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5421.679999999999s)]
*  is look, they're not going to defeat him with just commercials, the ads. That doesn't work [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5425.12s)]
*  as much anymore. And how many ads can you buy? You could swamp all of New York, which is very, [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5430.16s)]
*  very expensive. But with hundreds of millions of dollars, you could do it, right? [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5434.64s)]
*  But I don't think that's gonna get the job done. I think that what I want you to know and look for [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5437.599999999999s)]
*  going forward from this day to the day of the general election in New York is watch what the [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5444.4s)]
*  mainstream media does, cuz they're the actual hatchet men. Remember the Ackman money goes [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5449.52s)]
*  into buying ads in mainstream media. And then mainstream media coincidentally supports their [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5456.56s)]
*  candidate 100% and then digs and digs and digs and tries to find something wrong with Mamdani. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5463.6s)]
*  And then comes out and goes, we have this and this and this. And a Republican congressman today [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5469.4400000000005s)]
*  already added, he found a rap lyric in something Mamdani sang once. And he's like, [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5475.6s)]
*  he's supporting the wrong people in a rap line or whatever. So you're gonna see 200 stories like [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5482.96s)]
*  that as mainstream media on purpose is all negative against Mamdani going forward. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5488.400000000001s)]
*  And they will try to bury him. It'll be the media that does it. They're the culprit. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5496.160000000001s)]
*  All right, we gotta take a break. But if you think Mamdani derangement syndrome is bad enough, [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5502.08s)]
*  you're about to get a little taste of AOC derangement syndrome. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5508.8s)]
*  Our friend Chris Cuomo, not a fan, not a fan. We'll tell you exactly what he had to say when [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5513.12s)]
*  we come back. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5517.28s)]
*  All right, let's go to Super Chat. Our stone rights in the Senate Republicans turn themselves [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5531.12s)]
*  into the death panels that they accused Democrats of being during the ACA days. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5539.599999999999s)]
*  Every accusation is an admission. Yeah, there's gonna be real death panels in the sense of [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5543.68s)]
*  you get cut off of Medicaid and if you don't have insurance and you get cancer, you die. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5550.8s)]
*  That's so, but they've always all health insurances at death panel. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5554.959999999999s)]
*  Look, I'm enraged over private health insurance. Maybe we'll talk more about it in the bonus [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5560.48s)]

*  do get all of our content as well. All right, speaking of which, let's go to our YouTube [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5601.44s)]
*  members. Jason Travis, interesting comment here. Hi guys, I'm actually a conservative, [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5604.5599999999995s)]
*  but I appreciate that Jake and Anna give us the truth and our straight shooters. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5609.36s)]
*  Jason, thank you for being open minded for recognizing that. We appreciate it. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5613.76s)]
*  And thank you for caring about the truth. So I mean, so many on both sides go, I don't want it. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5618.56s)]
*  I don't want the truth. I just want you to tell me that my side is awesome and the other side is the [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5624.24s)]
*  devil's, right? So the fact that you actually want the reality is awesome and you've come to the [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5627.92s)]
*  right place. We appreciate your brother. All right, Sky Hurricane writes in, I think it should be [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5632.96s)]
*  required that if you vote for a war, you have to go to serve on the front lines yourself, [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5636.16s)]
*  that might make a difference. Well, it would make all the difference. We'd have zero wars. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5639.52s)]
*  Those- I know. Can you imagine Lindsey Graham voting in favor of war knowing that he'd have [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5643.040000000001s)]
*  to go fight? Or any of them, any of them, any of them. There's no way. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5650.0s)]
*  No chance. I mean, they're all almost all universally cowards. Almost all of them ran for [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5656.080000000001s)]
*  Vietnam, the older ones like Dick Cheney got a deferment, Donald Trump got a deferment. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5661.6s)]
*  All the guys who start wars are all chicken hawks, cowards, never serve, never will serve, [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5666.88s)]
*  etc. Sean Wan, MCC One says, is there anything left in Gaza that's the size of Manhattan [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5673.52s)]
*  and has been bombed to death? What can possibly be left? Nope, nope. Israeli supporters and [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5678.08s)]
*  Netanyahu supporters say, not enough, bomb them more. Titan says, whether or not the strikes are [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5683.04s)]
*  successful or not, to me is almost irrelevant. I believe the more important story is whether or [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5687.84s)]
*  not we should have done the strike to begin with. So that's definitely true. But the reason why it's [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5693.2s)]
*  relevant as to whether you can buy into the hype there's more left is are they going to do [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5697.5199999999995s)]
*  even more war? And that's what we're trying to prevent. But you're certainly right. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5702.0s)]
*  This Trump daily says Trump's bad cuz they're messing up his Nobel Peace Prize. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5705.92s)]
*  But guys, we want him to want a Nobel Peace Prize. So like, hey, Trump, if you get a two [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5710.32s)]
*  state solution and you actually get a free and independent Palestine, I know, a dream too big [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5715.76s)]
*  to believe, especially in these days. But if Trump does get that, he stops the Iran war, [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5719.92s)]
*  two state solution, then he would get a Nobel Peace Prize and he would deserve it. That's a giant if, [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5724.32s)]
*  if he does that. And we should be encouraging him to do that, especially with right wing allies. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5731.68s)]
*  Ancestral Worm says, okay, here's your answer. Your YouTube short title, Trump Furies with Israel, [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5737.52s)]

*  Chris Cuomo, he thinks of someone very specific. Take a look. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5796.08s)]
*  There is a real enemy that matters so much more than every other contrivance. It hates [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5801.44s)]
*  both sides. It is coming for all of us. I realized it was time for a wake up call [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5808.16s)]
*  when AOC, the member of Congress from New York, was hapless enough to call for impeaching Trump [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5814.5599999999995s)]
*  again. This time for doing something that led to a ceasefire. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5821.92s)]
*  Well, I do not echo what Chris Cuomo likes to echo there, which is this idea that AOC [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5830.639999999999s)]
*  is an extremist, adding to extremism in America. Now, that extremism, according to Cuomo, [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5837.68s)]
*  has manifested in AOC's popularity within the Democratic Party. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5846.0s)]
*  He also mentions, luckily, right wing nationalism. He thinks that the pro-Palestinian movement is [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5850.88s)]
*  extremist. He thinks the tragic killing of two Israeli embassy staff members is the result of [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5856.64s)]
*  extremism in the country. He also mentioned the assassination of Brian Thompson. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5863.36s)]
*  So look, there is extremism in the country that leads to people carrying out violent acts. And I [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5867.5199999999995s)]
*  am not in any way justifying those violent acts or co-signing onto that extremism. But I do want to [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5873.44s)]
*  break down more of what Cuomo had to say here, because he began this lengthy segment by criticizing [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5879.599999999999s)]
*  AOC for pushing impeachment against Trump, which he believes was just intended to get attention. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5884.639999999999s)]
*  And then after he criticized AOC's record as a lawmaker, he then stated that Americans need [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5891.68s)]
*  to worry about extremism represented by white nationalists and, of course, [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5897.280000000001s)]
*  pro-Palestinian student protesters. Here's the clip. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5903.4400000000005s)]
*  — Our worry is not just about brown guys with beards screaming about Allah. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5907.04s)]
*  Extremism has taken root among our own people, many of whom are brown with beards, by the way. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5914.240000000001s)]
*  It's not about how you look, it's about how you think, okay? Especially among our young people. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5919.92s)]
*  We see them on both fringes. The number one terror threat domestically for years has been [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5926.24s)]
*  and you're probably thinking Muslims wrong, right wing white nationalism. Now it has an equal [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5933.76s)]
*  opposite on the left with this perverse affinity for fundamentalists like Hamas. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5940.24s)]
*  Globalize the intifada, we hear alleged Democrats questioning Israel's right to exist, [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5944.72s)]
*  saying the regime in Iran is a victim. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5950.5599999999995s)]
*  — Okay, I'm getting real tired of the intentional lie that people who want Palestinians [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5953.28s)]
*  to live, to have the right to self-determination, to have their own state where they're governed [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5965.92s)]
*  without Israel controlling their water, their food, their everything, without settlers [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5972.4s)]
*  invading their homes, forcing them out of their homes. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5977.36s)]
*  People who protest on behalf of Palestinians are not by default protesting in favor of [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5980.5599999999995s)]
*  terrorist groups, including Hamas. So what Chris Cuomo does, and it's intentional, I don't think [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5987.36s)]
*  he's doing it by accident. I don't think he's dumb. I think he's doing it intentionally. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5993.04s)]
*  He is intentionally defaming the vast majority of protesters who look at what's happening on [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=5997.76s)]
*  the ground in Gaza and they're disgusted by it, rightly so because it is a genocide. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6004.96s)]
*  Okay, you hear politicians in Israel's parliament flat out saying we're gonna do whatever we want [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6011.360000000001s)]
*  to the Palestinians and no one's even gonna care. And you know what? Sadly, in this country, [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6018.24s)]
*  it feels like those in positions of power don't really care. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6023.2s)]
*  And so to hear Chris Cuomo fear monger about the people who have enough of a heart to care about [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6026.48s)]
*  victims of Israel's genocide, it just absolutely disgusts me. I don't know why he's so obsessed [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6033.36s)]
*  with providing cover for Israel's bad acts, for their genocide, for their war crimes, but he does [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6042.5599999999995s)]
*  it all the time. And honestly, quite frankly, I'm sick of it. I shouldn't have to do endless [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6048.48s)]
*  throat clearing about how I do not agree with Hamas. I don't support Hamas. I thought Hamas's [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6054.799999999999s)]
*  atrocities on October 7th were disgusting and that civilians must be protected at any and all costs. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6060.16s)]
*  I don't need to do that constantly to bring up the fact that I believe Palestinians should [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6067.839999999999s)]
*  also be protected, that Palestinians also have a right to live. This freaking clown, [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6072.879999999999s)]
*  I can't, go ahead, Cenk, go ahead. I can't stand him. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6077.6s)]
*  Honestly, on this issue, specifically the defamation toward protesters disgusts me. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6080.96s)]
*  Yeah, so I was serious to why he's doing that. I'll get to that in a second. So look, [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6085.52s)]
*  yeah, well, we'll see, we'll see. So number one, did he have some parts in there in that long [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6094.08s)]
*  spiel that were correct? Sure, as Ana pointed out, he rightly calls out the radical left, [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6101.52s)]
*  not really rightly, because I call out the radical left. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6109.6s)]
*  But the way that he did is problematic, which I'll explain in a second, [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6112.56s)]
*  and the radical right, though. And he does say, hey, actually the number one source of terrorism [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6116.08s)]
*  domestically, as you just saw, there's white nationalists. So it's not, just to be fair, [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6121.28s)]
*  he does also call out the radical right. Okay, now, but when he gets to criticism of the [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6126.88s)]
*  radical left, if he said, hey, on culture wars or any mentioned transports and a couple other [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6130.56s)]
*  identity politics stuff, okay, fine. We could, again, we have a normal rational debate about [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6136.96s)]
*  that, or we can get into histrionics or whatever it might be. But okay, that's at least something [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6142.080000000001s)]
*  that we're familiar with, and a real topic of debate as to whether going maximalist is the [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6146.160000000001s)]
*  right direction or not, etc. But- There's no equivalency. There's no equivalency. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6151.6s)]
*  Putting those two groups in the same argument makes no sense. Okay, the transports thing, [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6156.88s)]
*  even if I think there's actually a sound argument when it comes to the critics, [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6162.96s)]
*  that is not the same or even close to equivalent to white nationalism or right wing extremism. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6167.28s)]
*  Are you kidding me right now? No, no, I hear you, Ana. Absolutely, [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6174.32s)]
*  I'm glad you clarified that. But he then does talk about Manjoni and some on the left did celebrate [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6177.12s)]
*  him, right? And guys, whenever we say someone on the right or someone on the left, it literally [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6183.2s)]
*  means someone. It doesn't mean all of the left. It doesn't mean all of the right, okay? And so, [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6187.84s)]
*  and then there was those idiots who, the guy who shot the Israeli staffers, etc. So unfortunately, [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6193.84s)]
*  there has now been violence on both sides. Yes, the majority of the violence is from the radical [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6199.76s)]
*  right. If you're from the right and you're catching feelings over that, go look at the facts, [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6204.32s)]
*  the statistics and what the FBI says. If you want to say, deep state, I don't believe anything. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6208.32s)]
*  Okay, well then we're never gonna convince you anyway, because you don't care about facts. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6212.64s)]
*  Okay, so those are the relatively okay, fine parts, right? But when you get into what the radical [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6215.76s)]
*  left is, in his mind, that's where he conflates things massively, right? So first of all, on AOC, [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6221.280000000001s)]
*  well, you gotta separate out the policies that are economic in nature and non-economic in nature. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6229.52s)]
*  If you say, hey, some of AOC's positions in the past, like abolish ICE, doesn't pull that well, [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6235.360000000001s)]
*  which is a point that Cuomo made. That's true, right? But you're then throwing in all of our [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6241.36s)]
*  economic policies in the same bucket, but the economic policies are actually super popular. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6247.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, it's by design. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6253.12s)]
*  Exactly, Ana. And that is why I separate out the radical left culture war issues from the economic [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6254.639999999999s)]
*  policies, because the economic policies are enormously popular. And what Chris Cuomo in this [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6262.32s)]
*  case and almost all of the established media wants to do is, they wanna confuse you into thinking [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6268.16s)]
*  they're all unpopular. So they go, okay, transports, and that's why nobody wants Medicare for all. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6274.08s)]
*  That's not true. Medicare for all pulls at over 70%. And so paid families at 84%, [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6279.68s)]
*  what's radical about that? And Bernie Sanders, AOC, Mamdani, etc. are all in favor of that. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6287.76s)]
*  Their economic proposals are enormously popular. And honestly, mainstream media never, ever, [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6294.160000000001s)]
*  ever admits that, cuz they want us to fight on culture wars and not focus on looking up, okay? [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6301.120000000001s)]
*  Cuz the donor class wants to make sure that you don't do those super popular economic policies [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6308.240000000001s)]
*  that are gonna help you. They only want economic policies that help themselves. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6314.160000000001s)]
*  And then the last part of it that he throws in is what Ana's irate about, and me too. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6317.84s)]
*  I watched the whole segment and the whole Iran is coming. And my God, the protesters are pro-Hamas. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6323.44s)]
*  Iran, Palestinians, terrorists, be afraid. I mean, and it's so ironic cuz in the beginning, [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6332.0s)]
*  he's like, we shouldn't give into fear mongering. And then 60% of the segment was massive fear [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6337.12s)]
*  mongering about, let's be honest, Muslims. He said, hey, it's not about Muslims. And then [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6342.959999999999s)]
*  he talked about non-stop Muslims. And hey, Chris- [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6348.8s)]
*  Let's talk about extremism. No, no, let me jump in. Let me talk about extremism. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6351.4400000000005s)]
*  Extremism is giving Americans no choice but to fund a genocide in Gaza, okay? Extremism [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6355.52s)]
*  is seeing what's happening on the ground in Gaza and saying that's totally okay. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6366.08s)]
*  But what's not okay is that there are young Americans who are upset by it and are practicing [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6370.64s)]
*  their First Amendment right by demonstrating against it. That's extremism. Chris Cuomo is an [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6376.64s)]
*  extremist, okay? He's a pro-Israel, pro-genocide extremist. I think he's a problem in the country, [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6383.04s)]
*  okay? He wants to talk about, the left is extreme because of their stance on culture war issues. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6390.8s)]
*  Are you freaking kidding me right now? Extremism is sitting idly by or, in the case of Chris Cuomo, [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6397.12s)]
*  loudly cheerleading a freaking genocide that is funded by American taxpayer money. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6404.96s)]
*  That's extremism. Back to you, Cenk. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6411.2s)]
*  Yeah, so I agree. And so he says he's worried about violence. Now, brother, let me get this right. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6413.92s)]
*  You're more worried about a chant on a college campus than you are about 56,000 dead in Gaza? [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6421.28s)]
*  Don't tell me that you're more concerned about the dead because it's obvious that you're not. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6429.599999999999s)]
*  So you can catch all sorts of feelings about that, but I haven't seen you rant and rave [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6434.0s)]
*  about the 17,000 dead children. You want to talk about violence? Violence? The Israelis have been [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6437.599999999999s)]
*  committing a genocide in front of all of our eyes. If you want to do cover for them and go, no, [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6444.08s)]
*  I am offended. And some people I know and my brother's donors are offended if you say something [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6449.92s)]
*  about Israel and our fee fees are more important than 17,000 dead kids. [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6456.48s)]
*  That's a ridiculous point to make. No, what Israel's doing is 10,000, 10 million times worse [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6462.639999999999s)]
*  than any chant or anything that happened in a rally on a college campus. By the way, [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6469.5199999999995s)]
*  when pro-Israel people came onto UCLA's campus and beat the living crap out of the [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6476.16s)]
*  peace protesters, I didn't see News Nation or Chris Cuomo or mainstream media getting all [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6481.76s)]
*  of a sudden going, what the hell, these guys come in, start beating them with sticks and throwing [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6487.68s)]
*  explosives at them, etc. No, it's Israel, Israel. Right, come on, keep it real, Chris, keep it real. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6491.84s)]
*  Every day you do propaganda for Israel and you cover up 56,000 dead people. All of Gaza's [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6500.4800000000005s)]
*  destroyed. Do you have eyes? Have you seen all of Gaza destroyed? And you're saying the people [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6507.36s)]
*  protesting that are the real problem. There's a danger in America, people protesting Israel. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6513.36s)]
*  No, the danger is that we've given over $311 billion to Israel, a genocidal government [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6520.08s)]
*  that is continuing to slaughter, they killed 103 Palestinians yesterday. [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6527.599999999999s)]
*  Because they killed hundreds of Palestinians every day, every day. And if you protest it, [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6531.2s)]
*  they'll, you're the extremist. No, being pro-genocide is extreme. So I don't know [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6536.48s)]
*  why Chris loves and defends the genocide of Israel, but I see him doing it every day, okay? [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6543.839999999999s)]
*  And so my best guess is that his brother's donors are all pro-Israel. So probably the [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6549.919999999999s)]
*  circle that they know are like, yeah, isn't it terrible that they're trying to stop the genocide? [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6557.04s)]
*  I mean, we have a right to defend ourselves by slaughtering their women and children. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6561.759999999999s)]
*  We slaughtered over 35,000 women and children. That's a stadium full of dead women and children. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6565.2s)]
*  But Chris, go out there and tell everybody that's not a big deal. Don't worry about it, don't worry. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6571.2s)]
*  Somebody's protesting on a college campus, tell them that they're the real enemy within. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6575.04s)]
*  And that you should really be super scared of anyone who dares to criticize, beloved, [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6580.24s)]
*  beloved Israel. No, Israel's not beloved. It's a government, it's a government. [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6586.639999999999s)]
*  And governments sometimes do terrible, terrible things. And that is what the Israeli government [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6592.72s)]
*  is doing. And that is obvious to everyone except all the mainstream media reporters and anchors [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6597.84s)]
*  who are like, news in, slight chance, chance, problem, problem, giant problem, 56,000 dead. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6607.6s)]
*  Don't worry about it, okay? Yeah, we're in the news business. Remember everybody, you had to [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6613.76s)]
*  be pro-Israel otherwise you'll get arrested and deported, yeah. Okay, keep it real. [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6617.76s)]
*  All right, anyway, obviously that triggered me. We're gonna take a break. When we come back, [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6622.4800000000005s)]
*  we're gonna talk about Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez getting married in Venice and everyone hates it. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6629.2s)]
*  We'll be back. [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6634.56s)]
*  Yeah, I just wanna be super clear. You wanna criticize [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6647.76s)]
*  Mamdani's policies in regards to free buses or whatever, no problem at all. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6653.360000000001s)]
*  You wanna say, hey, I don't think his economic direction is gonna be helpful to New York. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6658.400000000001s)]
*  Agree, disagree, no problem at all. You wanna talk about how [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6662.400000000001s)]
*  Mashe and he's Muslim in any way or any of his policies regarding Israel, you're a racist. [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6665.68s)]
*  I just wanna be super clear. You're racist and a bigot. And no, the only bigotry in the country [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6670.8s)]
*  isn't anti-Semitism, okay? So anti-Semitism is real, it exists. It's also used as a weapon [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6677.52s)]
*  to make sure that you don't criticize Israel. So it's lost a lot of its power that it should [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6684.400000000001s)]
*  have for real anti-Semites. But it has no power left because you've called the greatest people [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6688.8s)]
*  on earth, people who are fighting to end a genocide, including a lot of Jewish Americans, [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6693.6s)]
*  anti-Semites. So you made a joke out of it. But every time they talk about Zorah Mamdani, [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6698.160000000001s)]
*  whether it's Chris or anyone else, it's like Mamdani, he's against Israel. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6702.64s)]
*  This Muslim now in charge of New York. Come on, guys. I mean, the bigotry is pouring out of every [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6708.400000000001s)]
*  cell you have in your body. Please stop making it so obvious. Jesus, come on. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6714.64s)]
*  They're gonna pretend, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6722.4800000000005s)]
*  It has nothing to do with him being Muslim. It has nothing to do with his criticism of Israel. [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6726.160000000001s)]
*  But did you know there's a rap lyric where he says something positive about a Palestinian? [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6730.08s)]
*  Terrible, the enemy within. Okay, shut up. It's just ridiculous. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6735.68s)]
*  Look, I gotta answer one question before we run out of time. This is a really good question. [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6742.4s)]
*  Velvet goldmine asked on Twitch, TYT keeps lecturing us about not being mean to MAGA, [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6746.72s)]
*  but they think it's cool to wear a t-shirt calling people vile. I don't get it. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6751.04s)]
*  So good question. Let me explain. Guys, what are you trying to accomplish? And who is your target? [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6754.32s)]
*  Who's your target audience? Who's the target you're criticizing, etc. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6759.36s)]
*  So I can criticize mainstream media all day long for two reasons. Number one, they have power. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6763.12s)]
*  Look up, okay? Number two, they're not a big block of voters. They're tiny. It's just a couple [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6768.32s)]
*  of hundred people, right? So the defenders of Israel's genocide, a couple of hundred, [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6775.44s)]
*  maybe a couple of thousand people in the country, not a big block of voters. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6780.5599999999995s)]
*  In that case, we're trying to show how bad that side is so that we'll win over a lot, [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6784.48s)]
*  the 98% of the voters that are not on that side. But when you attack a Trump voter and we lost the [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6790.799999999999s)]
*  popular vote, what you're doing is you're driving away voters and a lot of voters and voters that we [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6797.919999999999s)]
*  meet in the middle. We need them to come to our side. So you can say, hey, you know what? And [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6805.599999999999s)]
*  somebody else wrote in like, hey, those Medicaid cuts, can we call them fascist now? [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6810.96s)]
*  I get it. We're all super upset about it. And Kat cried with the wheelchair video and we're all [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6814.72s)]
*  broken up over it. And that's why you see us enraged over it. But guys, what is the better [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6820.88s)]
*  strategy? Saying, you voted for a Republican, fascist, but then they're not as likely to listen [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6825.36s)]
*  to the rest of the sentence and the rest of the argument. But on the other hand- [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6831.36s)]
*  Can I just jump in? [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6835.52s)]
*  And hold on one last second. But if you're fighting a powerful, they're not a big block [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6836.4s)]
*  of voters and that's exactly who you should be fighting. The politicians, the media, etc. Go ahead, [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6840.16s)]
*  Anna. Look, I actually agree. I'm not interested in lecturing people. You guys can hate whoever [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6844.5599999999995s)]
*  you want. And I'm going to pursue whatever strategy I think is more appropriate and more [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6850.88s)]
*  likely to bring people over to our side. So that's it. It's that simple. If Dave Smith, [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6858.0s)]
*  who's a libertarian and actually happens to agree that social security is a Ponzi scheme, [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6863.68s)]
*  which obviously I disagree with, is in favor of stopping a war with Iran. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6868.32s)]
*  I'm going to work with him, even though he voted for Trump and now regrets it. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6873.12s)]
*  It's that simple. You do what you want to do. I'm going to do what I want to do. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6876.24s)]
*  All right, back on to you with the Jane and Anna more news. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6898.32s)]
*  Not really, but it's a fun story and it has to do with Jeff Bezos and his wedding. So without [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6908.24s)]
*  further ado, here you go. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6914.799999999999s)]
*  Go wedding. But when the star studded celebrations kick off in Venice, [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6926.48s)]
*  it's one of the most romantic cities in the world. So it's no wonder why Amazon billionaire [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6932.4s)]
*  Jeff Bezos and Laurence Sanchez chose the Italian Lagoon City for their mega wedding. But when the [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6938.32s)]
*  star studded celebrations kick off in Venice this week, not everyone in the city is so supported. [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6944.719999999999s)]
*  Greenpeace activists displayed a large banner in the famous St. Mark's Square on Monday, [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6950.799999999999s)]
*  while a group of frustrated locals have threatened to disrupt the couple's big day [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6955.68s)]
*  any way they can. Look, a lot of these fancy European cities that people from around the [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6959.84s)]
*  world like to travel to have kind of gotten under the skin of locals because I'm sure it's annoying [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6968.16s)]
*  to have this massive influx of tourists come in and take up all this space. But it becomes even [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6975.04s)]
*  more aggravating when you're talking about one of the richest men on the planet, Jeff Bezos, [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6981.28s)]
*  deciding to have his wedding in Venice. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6987.12s)]
*  And of course, that's been met with a lot of protests. So Greenpeace and a group of [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6989.36s)]
*  Venetian activists dubbed No Space for Bezos have launched a multitude of protests against the couple [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=6993.599999999999s)]
*  because they say that Venice is already being overrun by tourists and other billionaires. [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=7000.88s)]
*  So we want to send, I should say, a very clear message. The ones who should be ashamed are them. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=7007.52s)]
*  They are the people who have destroyed this city, and that was a quote from one of the protesters. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=7015.52s)]
*  Now Venice's two square mile main island and historic center, home to about 50,000 people, [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=7020.8s)]
*  receives about 20 million visitors yearly, mostly day trippers from cruise ships or other cities. [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=7027.4400000000005s)]
*  And while tourism is central to Venice's economy and cultural identity, [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=7034.72s)]
*  critics are arguing that it has displaced residents and damaged some historical sites as well. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=7040.240000000001s)]
*  If you guys can recall, last summer we did a story similar to this that had to do with protesters, [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=7047.84s)]
*  locals who were protesting in Barcelona, Spain. [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=7054.8s)]
*  But we reported on those protests and I want to give you a little taste of what we had to say. [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=7058.400000000001s)]
*  Let's watch. [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=7062.24s)]
*  A water fight on the streets of Barcelona. Some locals spraying tourists with water guns [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=7064.96s)]
*  as they ate at popular restaurants, sending visitors fleeing from their tables. [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=7070.88s)]
*  Thousands of protesters walking through the city over the weekend, [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=7076.5599999999995s)]
*  chanting, tourists go home, and carrying signs with anti-tourist slogans. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=7079.84s)]
*  Those protests were taking place right before I went to Barcelona and I was happy to report that [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=7084.959999999999s)]
*  there were no protests happening when I was there. But I literally did consider not going [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=7093.28s)]
*  because who wants to spend thousands of dollars to visit a city where you're not wanted? [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=7096.959999999999s)]
*  But in the case of Venice, the Bezos, they're not wanted, okay? So the protests that took place [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=7101.44s)]
*  over the last few days in Venice were interesting. So in the video that we showed at the beginning [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=7107.759999999999s)]
*  of the story, Cenk, there was this big sign that was unfurled. Take a look at it. It says, [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=7113.2s)]
*  if you can rent Venice for your wedding, you can pay more taxes. [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=7119.679999999999s)]
*  So there's obviously a lot of political commentary associated with these protests. [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=7126.16s)]
*  And the No Space for Bezos group also threatened to flood the canals with inflatable crocodiles [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=7130.8s)]
*  to block the guests from arriving. And it looks like it's worked. Apparently, they've decided to [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=7136.08s)]
*  move their post-wedding celebration to a different location. And so, look, the protesters [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=7141.68s)]
*  believe that the reason why they moved the after party is because of their protests. [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=7150.56s)]
*  Others are arguing it's a different reason. Who knows, who cares? But what are your thoughts? [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=7156.56s)]
*  Yeah, I think that there's a really good political point in here. And I think it's [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=7160.240000000001s)]
*  best made by Warren Gunnels. He's the policy director for Bernie Sanders. [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=7165.04s)]
*  And he wrote, this is what oligarchy looks like. Jeff Bezos, the third richest man in the world with [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=7168.8s)]
*  $231 billion, can afford to sail into Venice on his $500 million yacht for his $20 million [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=7174.8s)]
*  three-day wedding to give his bride a $5 million ring, cuz his real tax rate is 1.1% tax the rich. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=7182.16s)]
*  That's exactly right. Look, I don't begrudge him the money that he's made. I'm not in that camp. [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=7192.8s)]
*  I'm not in the camp of there shouldn't be billionaires and we should eat the rich, [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=7198.08s)]
*  okay? But I am in the camp of why the F does he only have to pay 1% in effective tax rate? [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=7201.44s)]
*  When the rest of us in the middle class pay a ton of taxes, and then this guy gets to live [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=7207.679999999999s)]
*  spectacularly, no problem, as long as you pay your goddamn taxes. And they don't. So I would love a [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=7213.599999999999s)]
*  left-wing populist in office one day that makes them actually pay their taxes. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=7222.0s)]
*  Then they can have any goddamn wedding they like. [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=7226.8s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I love the political statements that are being made here. Now, again, according [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=7228.56s)]
*  to local press reports, the venue switch was really over security concerns. But maybe the security [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=7235.36s)]
*  concerns have to do with the fact that there are protests against them. But they argue, no, [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=7240.24s)]
*  it's the war between Israel and Iran, which isn't happening anymore. So the venue switch [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=7244.64s)]
*  happening for that reason doesn't make much sense. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=7250.0s)]
*  Anyway, protest away. I love the people of Italy. I love Venice. Do you booze? [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=7252.64s)]
*  Bonus episode is next tyt.com slash join. We'll see you there. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UcrbG2XJA&t=7257.4400000000005s)]
