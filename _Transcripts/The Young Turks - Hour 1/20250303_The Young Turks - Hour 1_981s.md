# Stock Market Reacts to MORE Trump Tariffs
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [March 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo)
*  Tomorrow tariffs 25% on Canada and 25% on Mexico and that'll start. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=0.0s)]
*  So they're gonna have to have a tariff. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=7.32s)]
*  So what they have to do is build their car plants, frankly, and other things in the United [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=8.74s)]
*  States, in which case they have no tariffs. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=12.86s)]
*  On the tariffs, is there any room left for Canada and Mexico to make a deal before midnight? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=15.0s)]
*  And should we expect those Chinese tariffs, the extra 10% to take- [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=19.2s)]
*  No room left for Mexico or for Canada. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=22.44s)]
*  No, the tariffs, they're all set. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  They go into effect tomorrow. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=27.8s)]
*  Well, the Dow went tumbling down following President Donald Trump's announcement today [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=29.56s)]
*  that he will be implementing 25% tariffs on all imports coming from Mexico and Canada. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=33.76s)]
*  Something that has not only impacted the markets already, but could impact prices here in the [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=42.62s)]
*  United States. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=49.12s)]
*  Now before we check in with how the stock market is doing, Cenk, are you surprised at [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  all that he's actually going through with this? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=56.519999999999996s)]
*  I'm a little surprised because he actually got some of the concessions that he was looking [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=58.76s)]
*  for. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=62.239999999999995s)]
*  And so I don't know what they're expecting with the new round of tariffs. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=63.32s)]
*  I do know the potential danger that's coming and for the country and for Trump administration. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=66.96s)]
*  Because there's a way that this ends very poorly and you're beginning to see that with [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=72.96s)]
*  the Dow. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=77.36s)]
*  So let's come back and talk about the potential ramifications here and what the right way [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=78.52s)]
*  to do this would be. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=83.25999999999999s)]
*  Okay, so before we get to the Dow, I wanna just kind of give you the details as we know [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=84.8s)]
*  them at the moment. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=89.2s)]
*  And Trump is known to go back and forth, sometimes renege on some of the threats that he's putting [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=90.56s)]
*  out there in regard to tariffs against our allies. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=96.68s)]
*  But here's what we know so far. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=100.48s)]
*  Now Trump had previously delayed tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=102.08s)]
*  It was a one month pause as long as Trump got some concessions and he did get some concessions [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=108.12s)]
*  from Mexico and Canada. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=113.26s)]
*  For instance, Mexico said that it would help stop the flow of drugs into the United States. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=114.88000000000001s)]
*  In addition to that, Mexico has increased arrests of people allegedly tied to criminal [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=120.16000000000001s)]
*  groups. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=124.62s)]
*  Scheinbaum, the president of Mexico, said Mexico was ready to respond to whatever Trump [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=125.62s)]
*  decides. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=130.48000000000002s)]
*  She's quoted as saying there will be coordination but not subordination. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=131.48000000000002s)]
*  Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Bloomberg TV on Friday that Mexico made a very interesting [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=136.54000000000002s)]
*  proposal to match the United States on tariffs for imports from China. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=142.78s)]
*  Lutnick indicated that Mexico and Canada could face lower tariffs than the 25% that Trump [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=148.45999999999998s)]
*  had proposed. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=154.78s)]
*  Although based on today's press conference, Trump says that he's going to implement 25% [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=156.2s)]
*  tariffs against Mexico anyway. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=160.89999999999998s)]
*  So that's where we currently stand on the issue. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=162.62s)]
*  But let's talk a little bit about Canada. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=165.06s)]
*  Because Canada, in order to kind of put off the 25% tariffs last month, promised Trump [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=168.32s)]
*  that they would help with preventing illegal immigration into the United States from our [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=174.51999999999998s)]
*  northern border. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=179.38s)]
*  Canadian officials also met in Washington last week with US border czar Tom Homan and [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=181.14s)]
*  members of Congress depressed their case that Canada was tightening border security in response [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=186.42s)]
*  to Trump's concerns about fentanyl and migration. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=191.45999999999998s)]
*  But they left unsure of what Trump wants, said Canada's immigration minister Mark Miller. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=196.0s)]
*  He's quoted as saying it's a moving target and that's frustrating. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=202.07999999999998s)]
*  But Trump claims again, he's just not satisfied with what Mexico and Canada have been doing. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=206.6s)]
*  So in addition to the 25% tariffs that he will be implementing on imports coming from [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=211.79999999999998s)]
*  those two countries, he has also decided to add an additional 10% tariff on Chinese goods [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=216.79999999999998s)]
*  coming into the United States. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=224.10000000000002s)]
*  And that's in addition to the 10% tariffs he had already implemented on Chinese goods [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=225.94000000000003s)]
*  last month in February. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=231.34s)]
*  So Trump will likely use something known as the Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=233.94s)]
*  in order to impose these tariffs unilaterally. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=239.86s)]
*  If you're unfamiliar with the law, it's a law that basically gives the president wide [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=243.18s)]
*  latitude, wide authority to implement tariffs and economic sanctions. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=247.70000000000002s)]
*  In the case of national emergencies, unclear what the national emergency is here, but Trump's [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=253.36s)]
*  been able to do all sorts of things unilaterally without much pushback from the opposing party. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=259.28000000000003s)]
*  So before I get to some more details here, Cenk, what are your thoughts? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=263.96s)]
*  Yeah, so first I'm gonna go to the audience and I'm gonna get my thoughts. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=267.4s)]
*  We're doing a poll in the live chat. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=270.92s)]
*  Do you think the tariffs are gonna be good or bad for the country in the long run? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=272.44s)]
*  So check that out when you get a chance. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=276.64s)]
*  Watch the show live 6, 8 PM Eastern every day, Young Turks on YouTube. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=278.6s)]
*  So our members are weighing in. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=284.02000000000004s)]
*  Chris wrote in on tyt.com. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=286.14000000000004s)]
*  I'm happy, last week I liquidated everything I had in the stock market. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=288.26000000000005s)]
*  The transaction is still going into my bank account, that's how fresh it is. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=292.68s)]
*  Well, Chris, nice play, brother. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=295.62s)]
*  Way to go. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=298.06s)]
*  I wish I'd done the same. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=299.06s)]
*  I don't think that things are going to recover much going forward. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=300.62s)]
*  That's just my guess. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=303.74s)]
*  Obviously, do everything you can based on your own judgment, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=305.52000000000004s)]
*  especially in terms of finance. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=309.16s)]
*  So look, the reason I think that they're not going to recover is because he's so [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=311.48s)]
*  erratic, none of this makes any sense. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=315.0s)]
*  I'll get to that in a sec. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=317.04s)]
*  Moonshine Dragon wrote in, the stock market is tanking so badly it almost feels like [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=318.40000000000003s)]
*  we're being governed by someone who went bankrupt six times. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=322.20000000000005s)]
*  Wait, so that's today, it goes up and down. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=325.88s)]
*  But yes, that's the overall problem. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=330.76000000000005s)]
*  The reason Donald Trump went bankrupt six times, and [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=332.78s)]
*  why I don't think he's going to be a good steward of the economy this time around, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=335.46s)]
*  is because he's not at all careful. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=339.18s)]
*  He doesn't know how to husband resources, he doesn't know how to portion, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=341.34s)]
*  he doesn't know how to plan ahead. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=344.65999999999997s)]
*  It's a giant problem. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=346.46s)]
*  Last time he was checked by the establishment, both for better and [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=347.18s)]
*  for worse at different times. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=349.94s)]
*  This time he does not have those brakes in the car. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=351.82s)]
*  And so buckle up, brace for impact. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=354.34s)]
*  Last one, and by the way, if you want to be a member on the website, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=356.21999999999997s)]
*  you go to DonaldTrump.com slash join, and you do get two months off annual membership there. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=360.28s)]
*  Belva Goldmeyer says, well, Trump's shift gears when he sees what happens with [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=364.4s)]
*  the stock market. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=368.03999999999996s)]
*  That's on Twitch, and that's exactly the right question. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=369.08s)]
*  And that's the one we don't know yet, because he often does that, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=371.28s)]
*  as we've told you 100 times, he A-B tests right in front of us. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=374.2s)]
*  Why do I think this is a bad idea? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=377.84s)]
*  I have no faith that Donald Trump can do homework, or [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=379.2s)]
*  apparently anyone in his administration, they're a runaway freight train. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=382.2s)]
*  So if you're a right wing populist, I still wouldn't agree with you on, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=386.12s)]
*  at least 50% of stuff. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=389.97999999999996s)]
*  But I can show you the right way to do it to achieve your objectives, not mine, right? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=391.82s)]
*  And on the places we agree, I can show you how we could both accomplish our objectives. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=396.09999999999997s)]
*  But this doesn't fit into anything in terms of populism or [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=401.34s)]
*  right wing populism or any of that. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=405.62s)]
*  So do you have any confidence that he's setting the right rates on the tariffs? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=407.74s)]
*  There's no reason to believe that these are the right rates. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=411.41999999999996s)]
*  These are gigantic, right? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=413.7s)]
*  If you're going to do tariffs, you have to be very, very careful, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=415.38s)]
*  because they have significant downsides. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=418.03999999999996s)]
*  So Ana and I are not necessarily against tariffs. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=420.24s)]
*  I believe in reciprocal tariffs, part of what Trump did in the beginning, right? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=422.79999999999995s)]
*  Hey, you said 20% on us, we said 20% on you. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=426.59999999999997s)]
*  But as you go to do that, you're likely going to cause inflation and [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=429.64s)]
*  you're going to create trouble, some upsides for some American companies, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=432.91999999999996s)]
*  some big downsides for American companies, different companies. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=437.52s)]
*  And certainly some downsides for the American populace. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=441.03999999999996s)]
*  Have you thought that through, what the right rates should be? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=444.68s)]
*  And have you thought a couple of steps ahead? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=447.62s)]
*  Okay, now, of course, when I do this, Canada is going to do that. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=449.86s)]
*  Then I'm going to respond with this, and then they'll respond with that. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=453.1s)]
*  And have you thought that through? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=455.98s)]
*  So far, I have not seen one person in the Trump administration who's thought through [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=457.18s)]
*  the very next minute, let alone all the consequences of these tariffs. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=460.74s)]
*  So it doesn't bode well, it doesn't bode well at all, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=464.98s)]
*  at least how they've started here. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=469.22s)]
*  No, and in fact, I'm going to go even further because you're in favor [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=470.70000000000005s)]
*  of reciprocal tariffs. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=475.0s)]
*  I'm in favor of reciprocal tariffs in addition to some targeted tariffs. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=476.16s)]
*  And in fact, as I've said repeatedly on the show, in the first Trump term, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=480.48s)]
*  he had implemented tariffs against China that were targeted, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=484.88s)]
*  that did play out well without spurring inflation. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=488.82s)]
*  And those tariffs were so good that the Biden administration kept them and [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=493.72s)]
*  even expanded on them. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=497.40000000000003s)]
*  What we're seeing with the 25% tariffs across the board when it comes to [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=499.52000000000004s)]
*  both Canada's goods and Mexico's goods, those are not targeted tariffs. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=504.29999999999995s)]
*  And in fact, will impact the price of essential items like cars, for instance. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=510.17999999999995s)]
*  And I want to talk about that briefly before we get to the stock market. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=516.02s)]
*  Because US car makers are concerned that these tariffs could blow up their [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=519.3s)]
*  North American supply chains. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=524.26s)]
*  And they had gathered just last week, as they did a month prior, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=527.42s)]
*  they met with Trump's chief of staff, Susie Wiles. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=532.6s)]
*  And during that meeting, she had kind of calmed their nerves about how this would [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=538.0s)]
*  all impact the auto industry. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=542.0s)]
*  Now last week, they did not meet with her. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=544.12s)]
*  They met with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who addressed the companies. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=545.96s)]
*  And well, it's concerning. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=550.2800000000001s)]
*  This is what the Wall Street Journal is reporting. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=553.2800000000001s)]
*  So while Wiles had reassured car makers, the administration would consider [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=554.96s)]
*  carve outs for cars that comply with the US Mexico Canada agreement. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=559.9s)]
*  The 2020 update to the North American Free Trade Agreement, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=564.34s)]
*  Lutnick made no such overture. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=568.66s)]
*  People with knowledge of the call said, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=570.9s)]
*  participants left unsure of what Trump would do. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=572.9399999999999s)]
*  So that's a little concerning. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=576.9399999999999s)]
*  But of course, we live in an endless cycle of gaslighting. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=578.66s)]
*  And so the White House denied that its message to industry and [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=582.5s)]
*  trading partners had changed over the past two months. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=586.1s)]
*  Saying there was no contradiction or change in message between the two calls with [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=589.1999999999999s)]
*  the auto industry according to an administration official, right? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=593.28s)]
*  Not buying it. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=597.12s)]
*  Now what I'm curious about is whether or [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=598.52s)]
*  not Donald Trump supporters are buying what he's selling in regard to these [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=600.3399999999999s)]
*  tariffs and how it is likely impacting their stock portfolios, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=603.9399999999999s)]
*  their retirement accounts. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=607.52s)]
*  And this is what I'm referring to. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=610.0799999999999s)]
*  If you watch this next video, Trump is talking about the tariffs. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=611.88s)]
*  And at the bottom right hand corner, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=616.74s)]
*  you have the Dow ticker showing how the Dow is performing as Trump is speaking. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=618.7s)]
*  Take a look at what happens. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=623.14s)]
*  I'm a huge fan of Ronald Reagan, but he was bad on trade, very bad on trade. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=625.5s)]
*  He allowed a lot of people, a lot of business to be taken. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=630.46s)]
*  So I say that with due respect because he was so great on other things, but [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=633.26s)]
*  he was bad on trade. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=637.58s)]
*  We are setting records right now, records like nobody has ever seen before. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=639.86s)]
*  When you have companies like this coming in, and almost 40% of their company in [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=645.4s)]
*  one signature is going to be devoted to what he does, which is one of the most [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=650.6s)]
*  important businesses in the world. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=655.6s)]
*  That's an unbelievable thing. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=658.04s)]
*  When Apple now is going to start building all of their plants here. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=660.04s)]
*  So there you have it. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=664.28s)]
*  You can see the Dow tumbling as Donald Trump is announcing these tariffs and [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=664.92s)]
*  going on and on about how he thinks these tariffs will spur [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=669.8s)]
*  new manufacturing jobs here in the United States. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=673.5s)]
*  And look, that might be true in the long run, but in the short term, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=675.66s)]
*  there will be significant economic pain for Americans. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=679.9s)]
*  And if you were worried about inflation under the Biden administration, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=683.94s)]
*  which was terrible, this could spark another round of inflation. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=687.54s)]
*  In fact, hyperinflation considering all of the items we rely on Canada and [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=692.1800000000001s)]
*  Mexico for, and I'll get into the details of that in just a moment. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=696.74s)]
*  Yeah, so two more good comments coming from our Twitch audience. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=700.76s)]
*  No math dragon as usual, the good comments saying, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=706.2s)]
*  Doge isn't cutting enough spending to justify the tax cuts. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=708.6s)]
*  And that's true, it's not even close. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=711.32s)]
*  Tariffs are Trump's idea of justifying the tax cuts. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=713.8s)]
*  Yes, that's why I think there's going to be a double whammy here. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=717.36s)]
*  So they're doing all of this manic cutting and tariffs because they already [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=721.52s)]
*  introduced the tax cuts. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=726.36s)]
*  That's always their number one priority. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=728.08s)]
*  As I hope we'll get to later in the show, it's $4.6 trillion in tax cuts for [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=730.66s)]
*  the wealthy and for corporations. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=735.34s)]
*  But they now have a new accounting gimmick where they're going to count it as zero. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=738.02s)]
*  Okay, because by any means necessary to get the rich everything they wanted, right? [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=742.74s)]
*  Once those tax cuts pass, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=748.8199999999999s)]
*  then they'll probably reverse course on a lot of these things. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=750.18s)]
*  But the reason why that's a double whammy is because if you drive up tariffs and [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=753.38s)]
*  trade wars in the short term, you're going to have that pain in the short term and [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=758.0799999999999s)]
*  maybe cause inflation in the midterm and maybe even in the long term. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=762.3199999999999s)]
*  And then if you backpedal out of them because the stock market's crashing or [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=766.68s)]
*  whatever else is happening, well, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=769.88s)]
*  then you're not going to get any of the long term benefits of the tariffs. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=771.92s)]
*  So you're just going to have the short term and [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=776.04s)]
*  midterm pain with none of the long term gain. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=777.64s)]
*  That's almost certainly what's going to happen. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=780.92s)]
*  Auguste Taser on Twitch says, why would Trump reverse course? [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=782.7199999999999s)]
*  This is clearly a Joe Biden market crash. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=786.38s)]
*  And he's joking, but I know they could paint it that way. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=788.98s)]
*  But guys, the chickens come home to roost at some point. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=792.34s)]
*  Because when you go to vote in the midterm elections, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=795.0600000000001s)]
*  the economy is either going to be doing well or it's going to be doing poorly. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=797.82s)]
*  And that is going to be at least 80% determinative of how the elections end up. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=801.24s)]
*  I mean, the Democrats are the world's most incompetent party, but [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=807.34s)]
*  they can punch themselves in the face 200 times between now and then. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=810.58s)]
*  And if the economy is shattered, then the Democrats are going to win easily and [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=814.72s)]
*  that'll be the end of Trumpism, period, forever. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=819.36s)]
*  Because then it'll be known not just as extreme or divisive, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=822.84s)]
*  it'll be known as a failure. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=826.88s)]
*  Because his core promise was, I'm going to improve the economy. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=828.8000000000001s)]
*  If he crashes it instead, sayonara, Trumpism is dead. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=832.72s)]
*  So we'll see, and you could cheer on them, these irrational actions now, but [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=837.4000000000001s)]
*  when they cost you later, well, that was your bet that you're just making right now [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=843.1s)]
*  as we speak. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=847.86s)]
*  And look, it does make sense that the markets aren't taking this news well. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=849.22s)]
*  The United States relies on Canada for its energy needs, significantly so, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=853.5s)]
*  along with meat and agricultural products, minerals, lime, cement, lumber, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=858.5600000000001s)]
*  especially softwood lumber and automotive parts. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=863.82s)]
*  When it comes to Mexico, we rely on them heavily as well for passenger cars, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=867.1s)]
*  trucks, and car parts to manufacture cars here in the United States. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=871.28s)]
*  In fact, it's the leading supplier of cars to the United States. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=875.4s)]
*  Also, we rely on Mexico for electrical equipment and electronics, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=880.0s)]
*  including computers, monitors, phones, refrigerators, air conditioners. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=883.96s)]
*  Mexico actually exports 48% of its oil to the United States specifically. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=888.4399999999999s)]
*  And we rely on them for all sorts of agricultural products, including tomatoes, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=894.68s)]
*  berries, avocados, bell peppers, cucumbers, squash, and snap peas. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=898.62s)]
*  And we rely on them for some medical devices and orthopedic appliances as well. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=903.22s)]
*  So this is going to be, if he goes through with this, and [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=907.74s)]
*  it appears he is hell bent on going through with these 25% tariffs, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=911.58s)]
*  there's going to be a lot of pain for American consumers. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=915.86s)]
*  There's no doubt about it. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=918.14s)]
*  So Mexico, by the way, surpassed China as the leading source of goods imported to [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=919.4200000000001s)]
*  the United States in 2023, so. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=923.1800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, last thing is, look, I don't know when the right wing is going to stop [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=927.04s)]
*  believing in magical thinking. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=930.4399999999999s)]
*  And I get it that it happens on both sides. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=932.12s)]
*  But in the case of the right wing, when Donald Trump invents things like, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=934.6s)]
*  we're going to do $2 trillion in tax cuts, I'm sorry, in spending cuts. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=938.24s)]
*  There is no 2 trillion to cut from the budget. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=943.4399999999999s)]
*  It's absurd. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=945.48s)]
*  There's no 1 trillion to cut from the budget unless you take really heavily [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=946.4s)]
*  from the Pentagon. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=949.6s)]
*  And now they've said not only are they not going to take any, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=950.76s)]
*  they're going to add to the Pentagon. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=953.3199999999999s)]
*  That budget is never ever going to get balanced. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=954.8199999999999s)]
*  And when he tells you, these tariffs, don't worry, or [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=958.06s)]
*  the gold card is going to bring in 5 trillion or 50 trillion. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=960.74s)]
*  You've got to stop believing absolute nonsense, because it doesn't help your [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=964.3s)]
*  side to believe in fairy tales either. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=968.5s)]
*  All it does is set you up to run straight into a brick wall. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=970.8599999999999s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below, an angel gets his wings. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=974.54s)]
*  Totally not true, but it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KorqHKIDqo&t=977.62s)]
