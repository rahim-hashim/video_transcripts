# Pete Hegseth In The HOT SEAT Amid L.A. Protests
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8)
*  The governor of the California has failed to protect his people along with the Mayor [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=0.0s)]
*  of Los Angeles. And so President Trump has said he will protect our agents and our [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=4.16s)]
*  Guard and Marines are proud to do it. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=8.0s)]
*  The law also says, Mr. Secretary, that the orders for these purposes shall be issued [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=9.28s)]
*  through governors of the states. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  You and I both know that President Trump has all the authorities necessary and thankfully, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=17.28s)]
*  he's willing to do it. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=21.04s)]
*  But- There are now more troops, more National Guard and Marines in Los Angeles than there are [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=22.0s)]
*  US troops deployed in both Syria and Iraq. So that's what we're dealing with right now. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=32.32s)]
*  The Trump administration has deployed US Marines, 700 of them, to respond to the [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=40.96s)]
*  riots that have broken out in Los Angeles over the last several nights. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=47.04s)]
*  And Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was on the hot seat this morning as he was dealing with [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=51.04s)]
*  questions and grilling from lawmakers over the deployment of active military to Los Angeles. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=57.519999999999996s)]
*  And it turns out this stunt could actually fly in the face of federal law and cost a pretty [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=64.32s)]
*  penny as well. Now, how much money are we talking about here? Let's take a look. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=72.0s)]
*  What is estimated cost of the deployment for the Guard and the Marines to LA? And where's this [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=77.2s)]
*  funding coming from? Will it be coming from quality of life programs that affect our service members [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=82.32000000000001s)]
*  or our families? If you want to wait until I finish- Before I hand it to Brian- Such as updates, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=87.12s)]
*  housing and barracks. Before I hand it to Bryn, the insinuation that we're pulling money from [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=91.60000000000001s)]
*  housing and barracks in order to fund this is disingenuous and incorrect. Just ask. Bryn can [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=95.84s)]
*  give you the numbers. Absolutely. So the current estimated cost is $134 million, which is largely [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=100.32000000000001s)]
*  just TDY cost, travel, housing, food, etc. Great. So much for cutting waste, fraud and abuse. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=105.68s)]
*  $134 million to deploy active duty military, the Marines, to Los Angeles to respond to [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=114.32000000000001s)]
*  the riots. And to be sure, there have been riots. I talked about that a little bit yesterday. I'll [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=122.48s)]
*  give you some updates on that today. But the real question is, does what we've seen on the ground in [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=127.12s)]
*  Los Angeles justify the deployment of now 4,000 National Guard troops in addition to 700 active [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=134.48s)]
*  Marines? I'm gonna go ahead and say no, even while fully acknowledging the loathsome individuals, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=145.04s)]
*  the wreckers who have decided to destroy parts of this city, engage in rioting, engage in looting. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=152.56s)]
*  Those people are scum and I have no interest in providing any cover for them whatsoever. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=160.64s)]
*  But let's not pretend as though the Trump administration isn't intentionally escalating [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=166.32s)]
*  the situation with a ridiculous disproportionate response, given how limited and contained the [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=172.72s)]
*  writing has been in very specific parts of the city. Now, some argue, who cares if it's limited [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=180.95999999999998s)]
*  to specific parts of the city? The riots are happening. No, the reason why people keep [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=187.84s)]
*  mentioning that is because it does not justify the volume of National Guard troops and freaking [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=191.92000000000002s)]
*  Marines that have been deployed. It just doesn't, it doesn't, okay? I want to squash the riots and [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=201.2s)]
*  the rioters. I have no problem with that. But in announcing the sheer volume of people that are [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=207.84s)]
*  being deployed in Los Angeles, that escalates the situation that riles people up more. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=214.48s)]
*  It makes what's already, in my opinion, a pretty disastrous situation even worse. I don't want it [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=219.76s)]
*  to grow. But the Trump administration doesn't appear to really have any interest in calming [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=225.76s)]
*  the temperature or cooling the temperature down a little bit. It's just constantly escalating [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=231.83999999999997s)]
*  escalatory statements and actions from the federal government. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=237.35999999999999s)]
*  And look, I say that as someone who also doesn't trust local leadership here, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=241.52s)]
*  right? I'm basing what I'm saying on my own investigation, looking into reports, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=245.44s)]
*  trying to figure out what's actually happening on the ground as opposed to just listening and [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=252.0s)]
*  taking at face value what our local politicians have to say. Because our local politicians have [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=255.20000000000002s)]
*  a history of lying to us about the reality of conditions, both out on the streets when it comes [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=259.36s)]
*  to crime, when it comes to a lot of different things. I don't trust them. I don't take what [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=264.64s)]
*  they say at face value. However, again, to reiterate, the riots are occurring. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=268.4s)]
*  They are small in scale, even though those videos make them out to look like the entire city [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=274.23999999999995s)]
*  is in the throes of terrible riots. And if you want to do something to calm the situation down, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=279.52s)]
*  announcing the deployment of active military isn't gonna do it. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=286.47999999999996s)]
*  But nonetheless, the Marines are here in Los Angeles specifically for up to 60 days, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=290.15999999999997s)]
*  or at least until the riots end. And they're also tasked with protecting federal agents [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=296.48s)]
*  and federal buildings, much like the National Guard is tasked with doing. Although last night [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=301.52000000000004s)]
*  was the first night in which you can see the National Guard engage with some of the rioters [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=307.36s)]
*  in an effort to provide backup to local law enforcement. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=313.28000000000003s)]
*  Now, in response to the deployment of Marines and National Guard troops without [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=316.96000000000004s)]
*  them being requested by local politicians, the mayor, the governor, California is now essentially [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=321.2s)]
*  taking this to the federal courts in order to get them to implement a temporary restraining order [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=330.24s)]
*  that would block the Trump administration's deployment of these National Guard troops and [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=336.4s)]
*  the 700 active duty Marines. However, just before we went live today, it was reported that the courts [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=340.8s)]
*  have denied this request. So we'll see what happens moving forward. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=348.48s)]
*  But prior to that decision by a federal judge, Newsom filed the request today on Monday, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=353.84000000000003s)]
*  alleging Trump had exceeded his authority and violated the US Constitution by sending military [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=359.84000000000003s)]
*  forces into an American city without the request or approval of the state governor or local officials. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=365.44s)]
*  Now, as some of you might already know, there was precedent for the president of the United [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=372.24s)]
*  States to send in National Guard troops without the request being made by local politicians or [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=378.0s)]
*  state leaders. And that was in the case of LBJ sending in National Guard troops in an effort to [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=384.0s)]
*  desegregate public schools. Now, of course, it wasn't requested for LBJ to do that, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=390.64s)]
*  but he did it anyway in order to protect students as they were going into schools in an effort to [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=397.04s)]
*  desegregate them. But this situation, Newsom argues, is different. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=403.52s)]
*  Although, again, initially with the initial decision by a federal judge, this judge apparently [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=409.2s)]
*  doesn't see it as so different and has denied this request. Now, using the Marines against [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=414.47999999999996s)]
*  Americans and civilians on US soil, in my opinion, is insane and does fly in the face of federal laws. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=421.28s)]
*  Now, if the Marines come in specifically to protect federal buildings, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=428.24s)]
*  if they come in specifically to protect federal agents from any violence that might be directed [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=433.04s)]
*  toward them, that's a different story. But if they're literally using weaponry or taking [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=437.76000000000005s)]
*  physical action against American civilian citizens, that's a problem. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=444.56s)]
*  And that does set a dangerous precedent. And for all the Trump supporters who are celebrating this, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=450.72s)]
*  be careful with what you're asking for here, because your guy is not gonna be in charge [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=454.96s)]
*  forever. The Republicans, I know it seems impossible at this moment, given how ridiculous [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=459.76s)]
*  the Democrats look, given how feckless they are, given how much chaos that party is in. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=466.0s)]
*  I know it's unbelievable to even imagine that they're eventually gonna be in charge again, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=471.67999999999995s)]
*  but they will be in charge again eventually. And so once you set a precedent under [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=476.88s)]
*  your preferred administration, you gotta think about what the consequences will be moving forward [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=482.56s)]
*  when the administration you don't like is in charge. And we'll point to this precedent [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=487.36s)]
*  to potentially use the military in instances where Republican voters are assembling and [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=492.32s)]
*  engaging in demonstrations. So with that in mind, right now is a good time. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=498.8s)]
*  Or I need a better understanding of whether or not the National Guard is actually needed. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=505.44000000000005s)]
*  Because this is, in my opinion, the biggest question. You have Gavin Newsom, Karen Bass, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=515.36s)]
*  local politicians in California arguing, we don't need National Guard, we didn't ask for National [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=520.96s)]
*  Guard. We got everything under control. Then you see footage of what's happening on the streets. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=525.84s)]
*  And one has to question whether or not National Guard is really necessary. So what do I mean by [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=531.6s)]
*  that? So here's LAPD Chief Jim McDonald. I've shown you this video before, but here's what he [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=538.0s)]
*  said during a press conference, not last night, but the night before. Take a look. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=543.92s)]
*  It is violence that I've seen is disgusting. It's escalated now since the beginning of this [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=548.08s)]
*  incident. What we saw the first night was bad. What we've seen subsequent to that is getting [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=553.68s)]
*  increasingly worse and more violent. Tonight we had individuals out there shooting commercial [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=559.84s)]
*  grade fireworks at our officers. That can kill you. And we have adapted our tactics to be able to [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=565.44s)]
*  have a chance to be able to take these people into custody and to be able to hold them accountable. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=572.56s)]
*  We are overwhelmed as far as the number of people out there engaged in this type of activity. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=577.84s)]
*  And the type of things that they're doing, they'll take backpacks and the backpack will have a [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=584.0s)]
*  cinderblock in it. They have a hammer and they'll break up the cinderblock and use that, pass it [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=589.6s)]
*  around to throw at officers, to throw at cars and throw at other people. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=593.68s)]
*  So that was Chief McDonald's, I should say, press conference yesterday in regard to the [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=597.6s)]
*  riots that took place on Sunday night. Now, there is some indication that while there were [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=606.96s)]
*  instances of riots taking place on Monday night, things were a little calmer than Sunday. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=613.76s)]
*  But the reason why I show you that video again is because my question is, if the LAPD Police Chief [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=620.4s)]
*  is saying we are overwhelmed, there's too many people, we can't handle it. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=627.36s)]
*  Okay, I totally understand not wanting the Marines to get involved. But is it a good idea to [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=631.52s)]
*  essentially reject National Guard troops who are there to protect federal agents, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=637.84s)]
*  but also federal property? I don't know. There's a lot of inconsistency happening right now in [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=642.96s)]
*  terms of what the two sides are saying. You have the Police Chief saying they're overwhelmed. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=648.96s)]
*  Then you have Gavin Newsom and Karen Bass saying, no, we've got everything under control. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=653.6s)]
*  Don't worry, I don't trust them as far as I can throw them, I'm just keeping it real. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=657.52s)]
*  But I also acknowledge that the Trump administration is intentionally trying [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=661.6s)]
*  to escalate things by putting out statements. First of all, by sending a disproportionate [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=666.8s)]
*  number of National Guard troops to LA and then threatening all sorts of things like sickening [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=674.0799999999999s)]
*  the Marines against Angelenos as they, in some cases, yes, demonstrate, in some cases also riot. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=678.8s)]
*  But we have local law enforcement and we could ask for backup from other cities [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=687.4399999999999s)]
*  as opposed to relying on Marines in order to respond to any of this. I don't know. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=692.16s)]
*  Look, everyone's lying to you. I just wanna be clear about that. Everyone is literally lying [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=697.92s)]
*  to you. You got the radlips who are like, no man, rioting's cool, man. This is just the expression [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=702.3199999999999s)]
*  of the frustrated man. No, it's not. I think it's disgusting. I'm sick of taxpayer dollars [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=707.36s)]
*  going to absolute waste in this city. Rioters break everything, then we have to pay for it. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=713.2s)]
*  Then they break it again. We gotta pay for the vandalism and the cleanup again at a time when [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=719.04s)]
*  we have a $1 billion budget deficit. I'm not even entertaining the rioters. The fact that the rioters [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=723.36s)]
*  exist is also a problem considering the fact that that's all anyone is talking about as opposed to [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=729.36s)]
*  focusing on the individuals who have been detained for deportation. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=734.64s)]
*  Who are these people? How many of them have committed crimes outside of being here illegally? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=739.52s)]
*  What kind of crimes have they committed? Is the juice worth the squeeze as was mentioned [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=744.88s)]
*  yesterday when we were covering this story? But we're not talking about the immigrants. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=750.24s)]
*  We're talking about the rioters because the rioters love to suck up all the attention. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=753.52s)]
*  They love to exploit any political issue to go wild and carry out their [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=758.56s)]
*  anarchy and their violence. I can't stand them and I can't stand the people who provide cover [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=763.76s)]
*  for them. And of course, they totally suck the energy out of the legitimate protests and the [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=768.16s)]
*  peaceful protesters who are now basically not even talked about in any of the coverage because [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=773.8399999999999s)]
*  the rioters demand all the attention. Can't stand them. I hate them. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=781.04s)]
*  Now, let's talk a little more about how things were looking last night. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=784.88s)]
*  There were some instances where things appeared out of control. So there's some intentional [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=789.92s)]
*  destruction of public property, which taxpayers like me living in the highest tax city in the [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=794.0s)]
*  highest tax state end up paying for it. It freaking pisses me off. So here's Alex Michelson, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=799.4399999999999s)]
*  who's from a local Fox affiliate. And he shares video of these rioters who were [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=804.56s)]
*  basically tearing the sidewalk apart, okay? He says anarchists hammered the sidewalk in [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=811.36s)]
*  LA to collect rocks to potentially throw at law enforcement. They said cars on fire and vandalize [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=816.72s)]
*  businesses as officers watch from down the street. So Alex appears to be adding some credibility to [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=824.08s)]
*  an argument that the right has been making about local law enforcement and how they just kind of [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=833.0400000000001s)]
*  stand by and allow some of these terrible acts to take place. Some stores in downtown LA were [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=837.76s)]
*  looted as well, including a CVS, a shoe store, jewelry store, and an Apple store. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=843.68s)]
*  But it's Los Angeles, so looting is just a regular occurrence. I don't know if it's really related [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=848.64s)]
*  to the ICE related riots or if it's just a typical night in downtown LA. However, according to the [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=853.04s)]
*  LA Times, there was far less chaos Monday night compared to Sunday when vehicles were set on fire [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=859.04s)]
*  and businesses robbed. On Monday night, police pushed people out of the Civic Center and onto [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=864.8s)]
*  downtown LA or into downtown LA, significant numbers of arrests were made. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=871.04s)]
*  Also, Police Chief McDonald argued that, which is a little different from what he argued earlier, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=875.5999999999999s)]
*  the possible arrival of federal military forces in Los Angeles absent clear coordination [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=881.76s)]
*  presents a significant logistical and operational challenge for those of us tasked with safeguarding [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=887.4399999999999s)]
*  the city. The Los Angeles Police Department alongside our mutual aid partners have decades [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=893.1999999999999s)]
*  of experience managing public demonstrations, and we remain confident in our ability to do [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=898.72s)]
*  so effectively and professionally. Okay, that's what he claims. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=904.0s)]
*  He said something very different literally a day before. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=911.28s)]
*  So you guys tell me what I'm supposed to believe, seriously. You have different messages coming from [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=915.0400000000001s)]
*  different people. Sometimes you have different messages coming from the same person. But [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=920.5600000000001s)]
*  the big question for the Trump administration now is how many troops are you willing to deploy [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=925.76s)]
*  throughout the country? Because these demonstrations have now spread to cities like San Francisco, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=931.52s)]
*  Santa Ana, which is also in California, Dallas, Atlanta, Louisville, Louisville, Kentucky, [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=937.3599999999999s)]
*  New York City. So are we just going to deploy all of our soldiers or all of our active duty military [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=944.0799999999999s)]
*  and stick them against Americans across the country? [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=952.08s)]
*  This is just not the right way, in my opinion, to deal with it. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=954.5600000000001s)]
*  But I don't know. I don't know how much I can trust what I'm hearing from local leadership either, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=959.84s)]
*  and I am sick of the riots. I would like to actually have a discussion about who's being [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=964.24s)]
*  deported, who's being detained, whether or not these are lawful detentions, whether or not these [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=970.96s)]
*  individuals are actually getting a day in front of a judge in order to ensure that due process is [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=975.6s)]
*  being carried out. No, the conversation is just about the rioters, because that's what they do, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=980.32s)]
*  and they know it because they don't care. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=985.6800000000001s)]
*  You think the guys that broke into the Apple Store had any interest in what's happening [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=987.6800000000001s)]
*  with the detention and deportation of undocumented immigrants in this country? [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=992.4000000000001s)]
*  And for anyone who wants to reference the color of my skin to say that I don't have the right [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=996.88s)]
*  to weigh in on how people of color engage in riots, first of all, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=1002.32s)]
*  you're a piece of crap for conflating the rioters with people of color in general. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=1007.12s)]
*  I've seen a lot of white people out there rioting, number one. And number two, if my tax dollars pay [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=1012.24s)]
*  for those sidewalks that are being ripped apart right now, I'm gonna go ahead and say what I need [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=1016.8s)]
*  to say. The rioters are a problem, okay? They were a problem in the summer of 2020 in that they [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=1021.1999999999999s)]
*  totally destroyed the message coming from the peaceful protesters that were involved with BLM. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=1028.0s)]
*  It was a problem that there was cover for them by people in the media and the left. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=1033.9199999999998s)]
*  And I don't think that same mistake should be made this time around. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=1038.8s)]
*  I think peaceful protesters need to be protected, rioters need to be arrested. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=1041.84s)]
*  And we need to go back to where this conversation really needs to be, [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=1046.8799999999999s)]
*  which is the individuals who are being targeted for deportation. And are we really comfortable [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=1051.4399999999998s)]
*  with $134 million being spent on deploying 700 active duty Marines to Los Angeles? I'm not [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=1058.72s)]
*  at all. But that's where we are right now. We're not getting any real straight answers. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=1068.64s)]
*  In my opinion, I think there's this rejection of National Guard troops from our local leaders [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=1074.4s)]
*  simply because Trump's the one who sent them without them requesting it. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=1080.96s)]
*  And I don't know how much longer this is gonna take. I don't know how much longer the riots [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=1085.9199999999998s)]
*  are gonna happen. I hope things cool down. According to reports, things were a little [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=1090.0s)]
*  calmer yesterday compared to Sunday. But honestly, not by much when you see the images of [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=1094.8799999999999s)]
*  similar things that you saw on Sunday, some looting, things on fire, way most on fire, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=1101.9199999999998s)]
*  of course. That chaos doesn't lead to any solutions. It doesn't help anybody, but I'm [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=1107.6799999999998s)]
*  sure it'll continue. Because we have a multi-year history in this state specifically of turning a [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=1114.48s)]
*  blind eye to this kind of behavior. And now there's a price to pay for it and it's pretty awful. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXncvrG1OL8&t=1121.3600000000001s)]
