The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful.

We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

# Poll Reveals Who Would Win In An AOC vs. Schumer Matchup
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [April 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q)
*  Is AOC potentially poised for [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=0.0s)]
*  another historic upset election in [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=1.92s)]
*  New York? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=4.32s)]
*  Well, according to a new poll, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=5.32s)]
*  that might be possible. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=7.0200000000000005s)]
*  You see a lot of people have been [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=8.72s)]
*  pushing for her to potentially [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=10.24s)]
*  challenge Chuck Schumer the next go [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=11.68s)]
*  around for his Senate race. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=13.42s)]
*  Because they see him as doing [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=14.98s)]
*  absolutely nothing to stand up to [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=16.44s)]
*  Donald Trump or the Republicans. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=18.16s)]
*  And according to a recent [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=20.16s)]
*  Data for Progress poll, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=21.54s)]
*  in a hypothetical primary, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=22.96s)]
*  which is admittedly, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=24.64s)]
*  almost 20 months in the future, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=25.92s)]
*  she currently leads by 19 points [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=28.18s)]
*  against Chuck Schumer, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=30.3s)]
*  which is fairly significant. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=31.74s)]
*  And honestly, there's not even that [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=34.1s)]
*  many people who aren't sure about [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=35.92s)]
*  who they'd vote for. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=37.54s)]
*  These are two very well known [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=38.379999999999995s)]
*  people. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=40.1s)]
*  And Data for Progress tried to see [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=41.14s)]
*  if maybe some of the most likely [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=43.18s)]
*  lines of attack against AOC would [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=44.94s)]
*  bring down those numbers. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=46.82s)]
*  So they produced, you can see [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=48.56s)]
*  right there that neither providing [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=50.260000000000005s)]
*  a positive bio had much of a change. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=52.36s)]
*  I gave her one extra point. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=54.58s)]
*  The negative bio didn't take off [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=55.980000000000004s)]
*  anything. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=57.74s)]
*  And we can just briefly go [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=58.620000000000005s)]
*  to graphic three. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=59.7s)]
*  We're not going to read [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=60.34s)]
*  the entire thing. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=61.14s)]
*  But it's like a thick paragraph of [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=61.900000000000006s)]
*  all of the most cliched attacks [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=64.26s)]
*  against AOC, that she's just in it [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=66.34s)]
*  for her brand. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=68.58s)]
*  She doesn't actually deliver. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=69.58s)]
*  She's just an extremist. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=70.78s)]
*  She can't bring people together, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=72.42s)]
*  blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=73.78s)]
*  all that stuff. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=74.94s)]
*  When people read that, it did not [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=75.98s)]
*  diminish their support for her at [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=77.46000000000001s)]
*  all in this particular poll, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=78.86s)]
*  which I think is pretty significant. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=80.06s)]
*  And there might be a reason for [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=81.78s)]
*  that, especially when she's being [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=83.02000000000001s)]
*  contrasted with Chuck Schumer. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=84.5s)]
*  When you ask New York Democrats, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=86.14s)]
*  do they want their leaders to do [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=88.1s)]
*  more, less, or the same amount [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=89.86s)]
*  they're doing right now to oppose [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=91.46000000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump, it could not be more [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=93.26s)]
*  clear. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=95.34s)]
*  Basically, every single person [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=96.42s)]
*  thinks they're not doing enough. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=98.5s)]
*  And who in New York has a better [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=100.78s)]
*  opportunity to do more than [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=102.66s)]
*  Chuck Schumer? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=104.26s)]
*  And he's not doing any of it. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=105.3s)]
*  And I just want to remind people, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=106.94s)]
*  this is the sort of poll we've [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=108.38s)]
*  shown you before, although it's [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=109.54s)]
*  an updated version of it. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=110.94s)]
*  AOC is actually tied for [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=112.5s)]
*  the third most net positively [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=114.42s)]
*  favored or seen politician in [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=116.86s)]
*  New York, actually. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=119.53999999999999s)]
*  Bernie Sanders is a little bit more [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=121.3s)]
*  liked, Harris slightly more as well. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=123.86s)]
*  But AOC is tied with Elizabeth [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=126.82s)]
*  Warren at a plus 60, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=129.01999999999998s)]
*  where she's at a plus 59 on that [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=130.62s)]
*  metric, 75% favorability. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=133.01999999999998s)]
*  And again, she has been in [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=136.46s)]
*  the public eye almost constantly [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=138.1s)]
*  for seven years. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=140.3s)]
*  People know about her, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=142.01999999999998s)]
*  they've heard the attacks, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=143.22s)]
*  they've seen it on Fox News. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=144.5s)]
*  And so, yeah, I'm not saying that [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=146.34s)]
*  if it came to a primary, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=147.94s)]
*  that Chuck Schumer or crypto packs [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=149.22s)]
*  or whatever wouldn't try some of [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=151.06s)]
*  these tactics. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=152.7s)]
*  But I think they might find that [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=154.1s)]
*  against her, it's a little bit less [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=155.46s)]
*  successful than against [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=157.06s)]
*  a complete unknown. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=158.22s)]
*  What do you think about this? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=159.14s)]
*  Okay, I think this is excellent [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=159.94s)]
*  news. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=162.14s)]
*  So let me break it down. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=163.18s)]
*  First, who should you support [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=164.38s)]
*  between AOC and Chuck Schumer? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=166.62s)]
*  No brainer of all time, AOC. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=169.14s)]
*  So does that mean I agree with [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=171.46s)]
*  AOC on everything? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=172.94s)]
*  No, she has some positions that I [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=173.70000000000002s)]
*  don't agree with, okay? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=175.34s)]
*  But I don't do purity tests. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=176.70000000000002s)]
*  So I'm not like, she disagrees with [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=178.82s)]
*  me 5%, burn her down. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=181.14000000000001s)]
*  No, no, so what? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=182.94s)]
*  She's still left on me on some [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=184.70000000000002s)]
*  issues, fantastic, who cares, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=186.18s)]
*  right? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=187.94s)]
*  So I would recommend that she runs [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=188.78s)]
*  on economic populism, because [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=190.98000000000002s)]
*  that's much more likely to get to [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=192.94s)]
*  a win, right? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=194.82s)]
*  But God bless, okay? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=196.18s)]
*  So why is it a no brainer though? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=199.1s)]
*  If I have some disagreements with [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=200.78s)]
*  AOC, I certainly have some [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=202.34s)]
*  disagreements with Schumer as well. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=203.74s)]
*  Because Chuck Schumer is the much [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=205.98s)]
*  bigger problem in the Democratic [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=207.94s)]
*  Party. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=209.78s)]
*  So like, okay, so we have some far [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=210.38s)]
*  left positions that aren't popular. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=212.02s)]
*  But you don't have to emphasize [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=213.9s)]
*  them, and that's not the end all be [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=215.22s)]
*  all. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=216.82s)]
*  The end all be all is, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=217.34s)]
*  are you a corporate goon or [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=218.46s)]
*  are you not? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=219.7s)]
*  Are you part of the establishment [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=220.7s)]
*  and the status quo, and [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=222.82s)]
*  you serve your donors or not? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=224.26s)]
*  That is the overwhelming issue. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=225.94s)]
*  That is the mountain of an issue, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=228.1s)]
*  right? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=229.78s)]
*  And that's what we've been talking [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=230.34s)]
*  about for 20 straight years. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=231.98s)]
*  So AOC doesn't take corporate PAC [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=233.42s)]
*  money, she's a just Democrat. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=235.57999999999998s)]
*  So someone who doesn't take [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=237.54s)]
*  corporate PAC money and is more [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=239.18s)]
*  right on the issues overall, and [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=241.22s)]
*  is 1,000 times less corrupted, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=243.42s)]
*  versus a guy who's been sheep [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=245.62s)]
*  hurting Democrats towards corporate [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=247.7s)]
*  positions his whole life. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=250.34s)]
*  Where's the question? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=252.34s)]
*  That's not even close. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=254.06s)]
*  And luckily the polls apparently [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=255.46s)]
*  agree with me, not close, okay? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=257.14s)]
*  So now, but [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=259.14s)]
*  the bigger reason why this is great [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=260.21999999999997s)]
*  news is because this is so telling. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=262.9s)]
*  I would have told you the same [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=266.53999999999996s)]
*  thing for five years ago, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=268.18s)]
*  ten years ago, etc. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=269.78s)]
*  But that poll wouldn't come out [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=271.53999999999996s)]
*  the same way. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=272.86s)]
*  And what has happened is [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=274.09999999999997s)]
*  Democratic leadership has lost all [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=275.21999999999997s)]
*  credibility. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=277.06s)]
*  Thank God, thank God, okay? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=277.97999999999996s)]
*  Not because I'm against Democrats, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=281.41999999999996s)]
*  but because they're the ones [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=283.21999999999997s)]
*  ruining the Democratic Party. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=284.53999999999996s)]
*  You need a new guard to replace [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=286.41999999999996s)]
*  the old guard, and it doesn't. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=287.86s)]
*  And if all it is is, we found [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=289.54s)]
*  a new corporate Democrat who is [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=291.5s)]
*  younger than Chuck Schumer. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=293.54s)]
*  Now Pete Buttigieg will replace [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=295.54s)]
*  Chuck Schumer, we have a new and [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=297.26000000000005s)]
*  improved edition of our corporate [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=299.02000000000004s)]
*  robot, right? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=300.74s)]
*  Well, that's not going to help at [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=301.78000000000003s)]
*  all, but AOC ain't that. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=303.14000000000004s)]
*  Even if you disagree with her on [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=304.54s)]
*  issues, she's not a robot. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=306.06s)]
*  She's a real person with her real [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=307.86s)]
*  opinions, who from time to time, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=309.82000000000005s)]
*  not as much as I want, but [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=311.90000000000003s)]
*  from time to time, fights back. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=313.42s)]
*  Okay, I wanted to fight back more, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=316.02000000000004s)]
*  but I mean, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=318.14000000000004s)]
*  compared to other Democrats, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=318.94s)]
*  it's not close, right? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=320.54s)]
*  So the fact that the voters, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=321.90000000000003s)]
*  the Democratic voters in here, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=323.42s)]
*  now remember what I told you. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=325.02000000000004s)]
*  You have to pay attention to [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=326.98s)]
*  the voters when they give you [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=328.22s)]
*  a clear sign. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=329.5s)]
*  So maybe you thought there wasn't [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=330.38s)]
*  crime in Oakland, but [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=331.86s)]
*  when the voters of Oakland say 65 [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=332.86s)]
*  to 35, goddamn right, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=334.46000000000004s)]
*  there was crime. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=335.62s)]
*  And we were ousting this mayor, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=336.46000000000004s)]
*  pay attention to that. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=338.42s)]
*  But also pay attention to this, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=340.02000000000004s)]
*  where the Democratic voters are [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=342.02000000000004s)]
*  saying, yes, we prefer AOC by [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=343.98s)]
*  a large margin to Chuck Schumer, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=345.98s)]
*  so stop sending us those corporate [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=348.62s)]
*  robots. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=350.58s)]
*  I love it, I love it. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=351.42s)]
*  That is a sea change of [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=353.22s)]
*  a difference. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=354.46s)]
*  You would not have seen that before [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=355.34s)]
*  this election. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=356.7s)]
*  So when I said I feel a little bit [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=357.7s)]
*  liberated after this election, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=359.26s)]
*  people, I get it. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=361.1s)]
*  It's a phrase that triggers people [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=362.42s)]
*  and go, so you like the trauma. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=364.7s)]
*  No, no, no, no, you guys, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=366.86s)]
*  we're getting liberated from [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=368.58s)]
*  the Chuck Schumers, Nancy Pelosi, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=370.5s)]
*  and Joe Biden's of this party that [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=372.82s)]
*  have been dragging us down like [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=374.9s)]
*  our whole lives. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=376.82s)]
*  See, and this poll is an excellent [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=378.26s)]
*  indication of that liberation. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=379.9s)]
*  The voters are finally saying, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=381.78s)]
*  we don't believe you anymore when [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=383.26s)]
*  you tell us Democratic leaders are [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=384.82s)]
*  geniuses and we have to obey and [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=386.34s)]
*  comply with them. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=387.94s)]
*  That's the best trend there is. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=389.42s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=391.58s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, look, to your point, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=392.18s)]
*  I know a lot of our viewers have [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=393.98s)]
*  mixed feelings on AOC, but [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=395.62s)]
*  this is a big deal. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=397.06s)]
*  She is still one of the most [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=398.7s)]
*  progressive representatives that [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=399.94s)]

*  She's in her mid 30s and [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=402.5s)]
*  she is not Chuck Schumer. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=403.7s)]
*  And as much as I don't think [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=405.38s)]
*  anyone should support a candidate [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=406.82s)]
*  just because they're not [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=408.58s)]
*  the other candidate, it is a huge [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=409.9s)]
*  deal that someone so young and so [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=411.61999999999995s)]
*  far left of the median is gaining [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=413.5s)]
*  this widespread support in this way. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=415.38s)]

*  That's why we're progressives, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=441.46s)]
*  right? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=442.82s)]
*  Chuck Schumer has proven time and [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=443.32s)]

*  He's not stupid. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=452.05999999999995s)]
*  I think he's arrogant, even though [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=453.29999999999995s)]
*  I think that he would think that he [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=455.21999999999997s)]
*  is wise and experienced. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=456.97999999999996s)]
*  But experience can only get you so [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=458.26s)]
*  far in politics. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=460.14s)]
*  At some point, you do need to step [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=461.38s)]
*  aside and let the next generation [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=463.42s)]
*  lead or at least not hinder them [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=465.42s)]
*  and not get in their way whenever [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=467.34s)]
*  they try to make things better for [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=469.42s)]
*  their generation and for their [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=471.54s)]
*  families and for the future people [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=473.42s)]
*  who are coming. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=475.46s)]
*  And Chuck Schumer, his age is [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=476.54s)]
*  really just the least of the [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=478.1s)]
*  reasons as to why he should be out [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=479.58s)]
*  of Congress or at least out of such [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=481.46s)]
*  a high position in Congress. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=483.3s)]
*  He simply does not support [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=484.82s)]
*  the American people anymore. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=486.1s)]
*  His stances do not support [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=487.65999999999997s)]
*  the American people and he doesn't [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=488.94s)]
*  understand the American people. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=490.7s)]
*  He doesn't back our stances. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=492.14s)]
*  He doesn't listen to what [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=493.65999999999997s)]
*  the American people actually want [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=494.97999999999996s)]
*  out of their government and [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=496.86s)]
*  from their representatives. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=498.41999999999996s)]
*  And he even said that his job in [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=500.18s)]
*  Congress is not to support his [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=502.09999999999997s)]
*  constituents, it's to support [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=504.02s)]
*  Israel. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=506.18s)]
*  That's wrong by definition. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=506.86s)]
*  That is not his job. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=508.46s)]
*  That's not what he is in Congress [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=509.7s)]
*  to be doing. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=511.41999999999996s)]
*  So get him out of there. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=512.54s)]
*  I'm so over this guy. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=514.1s)]
*  Yeah, I got to add one thing here. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=515.66s)]
*  So we did a town hall for [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=517.62s)]
*  Operation Hope earlier in the week. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=518.9399999999999s)]
*  If you're a member, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=520.8199999999999s)]
*  please check that out. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=521.66s)]
*  Because a lot of our core viewers [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=522.7s)]
*  who are part of Operation Hope asked [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=524.7s)]
*  me about, hey, far left, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=526.9s)]
*  radical left, what are you doing? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=528.3s)]
*  Help us understand. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=530.34s)]
*  Some of us are to the left of [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=531.58s)]
*  yours significantly to the left of [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=533.14s)]
*  you and we had a wonderful [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=535.02s)]
*  conversation. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=536.3s)]
*  So please check that out if you [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=536.9s)]
*  can, if you're a member. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=538.34s)]
*  But I want to summarize this super [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=539.58s)]
*  quick here. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=541.3s)]
*  So, and this is a good example, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=542.34s)]
*  but that's why I'm doing it here. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=543.74s)]
*  So far left is on, and by the way, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=545.46s)]
*  the viewers got me to change the [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=547.38s)]
*  language a little bit and [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=549.34s)]
*  I want to explain that to you, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=550.94s)]
*  okay? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=552.62s)]
*  Far left is on policies. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=553.1400000000001s)]
*  So and maybe I would, so hence, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=554.3800000000001s)]
*  I think I've been saying it a [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=555.82s)]
*  little bit wrong and certainly [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=557.1s)]
*  haven't been clear enough, right? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=558.3800000000001s)]
*  So you can argue that AOC is far [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=559.86s)]
*  left on policies. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=561.7800000000001s)]
*  Great, no problem. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=563.22s)]
*  I'm far left on some policies, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=564.0600000000001s)]
*  right? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=566.2600000000001s)]
*  And there's normal disagreements on [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=566.82s)]
*  a whole host of issues, right? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=569.3000000000001s)]
*  What I'm objecting to is [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=571.98s)]
*  the radical left. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=573.34s)]
*  And so in radical, not in policy, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=574.58s)]
*  but in attitude. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=577.3800000000001s)]
*  So this is also a good example in [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=579.26s)]
*  this case, because some of [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=581.38s)]
*  the radical left are angry at AOC [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=583.22s)]
*  and they think she's not left [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=585.62s)]
*  enough, including on Palestine. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=587.62s)]
*  Yeah, look, I get it. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=590.7s)]
*  I wish she spoke out a little bit [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=591.98s)]
*  more and I wish she voted a little [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=593.5s)]
*  bit more around the edges on that [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=595.14s)]
*  issue and what she said during [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=596.78s)]
*  the convention about how Kamala [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=598.3s)]
*  Harris was great on this issue is [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=599.86s)]
*  not true. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=601.54s)]
*  She's not great on this issue. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=602.1s)]
*  I understand all that and [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=603.5s)]
*  I care deeply about that issue. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=604.66s)]
*  I'm not canceling her over that. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=606.7s)]
*  Are you insane? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=608.38s)]
*  So what do you want Schumer to win? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=609.98s)]
*  Schumer's much worse on Palestine. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=612.18s)]
*  So the attitude is what I object [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=614.5s)]
*  to, so you don't like AOC's [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=616.46s)]
*  position on Palestine. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=618.5s)]
*  Then it'll work to get her to [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=621.42s)]
*  the right position instead of [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=623.1s)]
*  saying that's it, she's no good. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=625.1s)]
*  She didn't pass the purity test. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=628.06s)]
*  No, I'm more pure than her. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=630.3s)]
*  God, are you insane? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=632.1s)]
*  Please, please, this attitude is [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=633.82s)]
*  going to take out everyone and [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=635.78s)]
*  forget the host, the candidates. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=637.62s)]
*  Don't attack the candidates, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=640.46s)]
*  please, please don't do crazy [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=642.34s)]
*  stuff like that. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=644.14s)]
*  So, but I mean, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=645.14s)]
*  I'm addressing there the radicals [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=646.1800000000001s)]
*  and they're not going to listen to [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=648.0200000000001s)]
*  me because that by definition [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=649.98s)]
*  their radicals in their attitude. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=651.82s)]
*  So AOC would be amazing as a New [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=654.1s)]
*  York senator, especially vis-a-vis [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=656.14s)]
*  Chuck Schumer. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=658.86s)]
*  So please use your sense to get to [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=660.7s)]
*  the best possible candidate without [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=663.46s)]
*  demanding some sort of weird 100% [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=667.34s)]
*  agreement with you. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=669.98s)]
*  Which politician agrees 100% with [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=671.62s)]
*  any citizen? [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=673.7s)]
*  That's just a totally [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=675.14s)]
*  unreasonable standard. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=676.46s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=678.22s)]
*  an angel gets his wings. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=679.74s)]
*  Totally not true, but it does keep [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=681.3s)]
*  you updated on our live shows. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPT352br5Q&t=682.86s)]
