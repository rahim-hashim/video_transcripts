# Tucker Carlson EMBARRASSES Ted Cruz. Trump HINTS At US STRIKES on Iran. ICE ARRESTS Brad Lander
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A)
*  I don't care about you. I just want your vote. I'm so upset. Oh my god [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=0.0s)]
*  Hello, hello. Welcome to CYT. I'm your host, Anna Kasparian, and I'm exhausted. So bear [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=60.0s)]
*  with me today. I've been traveling a lot. Just flew in from New York, from New York [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=73.52s)]
*  to LA this morning, and haven't gotten very little sleep. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=78.16s)]
*  There's a lot of really interesting stories in the rundown today, including, I never in a million [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=82.67999999999999s)]
*  years would have thought I would say this, but maybe the best interview of a United States [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=90.36s)]
*  Senator I have ever seen. Tucker Carlson interviews Senator Ted Cruz. Wow, wow. So we're [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=96.36s)]
*  going to spend some time on that because they did touch on a lot of different topics. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=104.75999999999999s)]
*  Clearly, Tucker Carlson came very prepared. Ted Cruz thought he was going to be able to squirm [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=109.64s)]
*  his way out of uncomfortable situations in the context of that interview, of course. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=116.2s)]
*  So we're going to get to some of the highlights that I've noticed people aren't talking about [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=121.08000000000001s)]
*  as much. So we'll get to that first. We're also going to give you an update on the latest as it [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=125.4s)]
*  pertains to what feels like us barreling toward a regime change war in Iran. This whole nuclear [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=130.76000000000002s)]
*  weapons thing, I believe, is a facade. I believe it's just the excuse to drum up enough support [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=138.68s)]
*  for us to get involved in a regime change war in Iran. I really hope that it doesn't happen, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=145.48s)]
*  but there hasn't really been a lot of great updates, especially over the last few days when [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=151.4s)]
*  it comes to that story. And we've got a lot of other things to get to, including, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=155.88s)]
*  I guess, another Turning Point USA event in which Charlie Kirk said something to a young girl [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=161.07999999999998s)]
*  in braces. She has braces and he's giving her life advice that, for whatever reason, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=168.44s)]
*  really upset me and seemed so condescending, patronizing, and gross. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=175.32s)]
*  But anyway, we're going to get to that later in the second hour of the show. By the way, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=180.44s)]
*  unfortunately, my co-host today had some sort of emergency and couldn't join me. So I'll be doing [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=184.6s)]
*  the whole show by myself today, which is excellent. It's a great day to do it by myself, but it's [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=190.12s)]
*  going to be fine. Kate Batino, our producer, is going to join me in the bonus episode with [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=195.56s)]
*  our members. And we're going to go over my CNN appearance last night on Abby Phillips' show. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=200.92000000000002s)]
*  I really want to talk about it with you guys and see what you think. So we'll get to that [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=206.92000000000002s)]
*  in the bonus episode, tyt.com slash join to become a member. All right, enough of that. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=210.28s)]
*  Let's get to our first story. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=214.84s)]
*  Are APEC's goals shaped by the goals of the Israeli government? And I'm just going to ask [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=215.96s)]
*  you a question straightforwardly. And if you say no, I think we both know that's not true. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=222.20000000000002s)]
*  Hey, are they shaped by? Is that- Are they coordinating with the Israeli [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=225.48000000000002s)]
*  government to represent the Israeli government? Are they talking with them? Yes, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=229.8s)]
*  Israel directing them. You want to talk about Farah, the law on lobbying on behalf of someone? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=231.72s)]
*  Yeah. It is, I hire you and you lobby on behalf of me. I direct you. Does Israel direct APEC? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=237.08s)]
*  What you're now describing in a very defensive way, I will say, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=242.68s)]
*  is foreign influence over our politics. And you began and it's so transparently obvious to everybody. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=245.96s)]
*  It's a very weird thing. The obsession with Israel. We're talking about foreign countries. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=252.92s)]
*  It's hardly an obsession. You're not talking about Chinese. You're not talking about Japanese. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=259.4s)]
*  You're not talking about the British. You're not talking about the French. The question, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=262.6s)]
*  what about the Jews? What about the Jews? I'm an anti-Semite now. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=265.08s)]
*  Yeah. Tucker Carlson carried out what I believe to be one of the best, if not the best, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=268.2s)]
*  interview of a sitting United States Senator that I've ever seen. I mean, it was incredible. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=278.28s)]
*  You just heard him in a bit of an exchange with Republican Senator Ted Cruz, who he [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=283.71999999999997s)]
*  sparred with throughout the entirety of their two-hour long conversation. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=291.08s)]
*  It's getting a lot of attention online. And I really went out of my way to try to find the [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=295.4s)]
*  points of that conversation that people aren't talking about as much. Some of you may have come [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=300.92s)]
*  across the video that went viral featuring Ted Cruz, essentially letting the world know that he [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=306.84s)]
*  doesn't know basic facts about Iran, a country that he would like to see regime change in, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=313.4s)]
*  a country that the United States might get involved in pushing for regime change in. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=320.52s)]
*  Unbelievable, right? So that went viral for obvious reasons. He didn't even know the ethnic makeup [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=325.64s)]
*  of the residents of Iran. Didn't know the population. You might wanna know whether or not [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=331.0s)]
*  it's ruled by Sunnis, Shiites. It's just basic, basic. If you're gonna try to carry out a regime [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=339.79999999999995s)]
*  change war, you need to know the basics. Okay, I'm not gonna talk about that because there's [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=346.6s)]
*  so many other topics that they touched on, including the influence of something we talk [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=350.44s)]
*  about quite a bit on the show, and that's the Israel lobby. Okay, it's not the Jewish lobby, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=355.24s)]
*  it's the Israel lobby. It's known as AIPAC. And I say Israel lobby because this lobby isn't about [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=359.96000000000004s)]
*  helping Jewish people across the world. This is a lobby that is powerful because of its involvement [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=366.52000000000004s)]
*  of evangelical Christians and yes, Zionists as well. And it's not to make life better for [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=372.6s)]
*  Jews in America, for instance. It's all about basically lobbying our government to carry out [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=378.20000000000005s)]
*  policies that are preferential and beneficial to Israel. And I was shocked to see that Tucker [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=385.48s)]
*  Carlson wanted to take Cruz to task over this. So without further ado, let's take a look. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=392.28000000000003s)]
*  I've never taken money from the Israel lobby, have you? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=398.44s)]
*  It taken money from the Israel- From AIPAC. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=402.28s)]
*  So AIPAC raises a lot of money for me, but it's actually a misnomer because the people who raise [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=405.64s)]
*  money are individuals. So it's not the pack itself, but they're individual members who believe in the [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=409.71999999999997s)]
*  American-Israeli friendship and relationship. Is AIPAC a foreign lobby? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=415.08s)]
*  No, it's an American lobby. It's the AIPAC stands for the America-Israeli Political Action Committee. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=419.96s)]
*  What is it lobby for? So to be honest, not a whole lot effectively. Listen, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=424.52s)]
*  I came into Congress 13 years ago with the stated intention of being the leading defender of Israel [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=430.2s)]
*  in the United States Senate. I've worked every day to do that. AIPAC a lot of times, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=437.71999999999997s)]
*  AIPAC I wish were much more effective. My understanding having known a lot of [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=444.68s)]
*  people who work at AIPAC is that it lobbies on behalf of the Israeli government. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=448.12s)]
*  Oh, okay. When was the last time AIPAC took a position that deviated from Prime Minister Netanyahu? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=453.47999999999996s)]
*  Not all the time. Okay. Let me go back and give a little history. If you want to do a deep dive on [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=459.88s)]
*  AIPAC- I don't. I want to do a shallow dive. I want to get to the core question. AIPAC is [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=466.12s)]
*  lobbying for a foreign government. It's not. It's lobbying for the United States. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=471.08s)]
*  It is lobbying for a strong US-Israeli relationship. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=475.96s)]
*  Guys, guys, I have never seen anyone in media, okay, whether we're talking about left-wing media, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=479.56s)]
*  right-wing media. I haven't seen a single journalist in this country [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=490.04s)]
*  ask an aggressive line of questioning like that about AIPAC and its influence on US foreign [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=494.84000000000003s)]
*  policy, especially in the Middle East, obviously. That was amazing. I mean, look, I hate to be in [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=500.44s)]
*  a position where I'm praising a man who I have far more disagreements with than agreements with, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=507.48s)]
*  but I don't care. I don't care. This interview was incredible. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=513.16s)]
*  First of all, how illuminating is it that we literally have a sitting United States [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=519.0s)]
*  senator who openly says that he came into the Senate promising to be the number one [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=525.16s)]
*  representative and defender of Israel of a foreign country, of a foreign country. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=532.6s)]
*  If that doesn't infuriate you, there's something wrong with you. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=538.2s)]
*  He was supposed to represent this country, the constituents who voted him in the great state [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=542.2s)]
*  of Texas, right? And he feels like it's totally okay to openly say, I came into the Senate, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=549.24s)]
*  committed to be the number one representative supporter. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=557.8000000000001s)]
*  I can't remember the exact word he used, but basically to represent Israel's interests. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=561.32s)]
*  So look, given that he feels comfortable saying that openly, which I'm not interested in having [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=567.72s)]
*  anyone in Congress who prioritizes any foreign country over our own. I'm Armenian American, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=574.0400000000001s)]
*  right? If someone came into Congress and said, you know what? I came into Senate [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=580.6800000000001s)]
*  wanting to be the number one representative of Armenia. I'd be like, but why? But why? No, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=586.52s)]
*  we have problems here. And I think I finally figured out what's making Tucker tick, what the [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=592.3599999999999s)]
*  big change with him has been. I think he's looking at the conditions we're all living in in this [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=599.0799999999999s)]
*  country, the drug overdoses, the extreme poverty, the homelessness. And he's asking himself, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=604.4399999999999s)]
*  why are we so focused on foreign conflicts or what's happening outside of the United States? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=612.28s)]
*  Okay, so there's more because you can tell Ted Cruz is getting a little bit uncomfortable. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=617.24s)]
*  He's getting increasingly defensive, but then he finally just can't hold back anymore. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=624.12s)]
*  And he says the quiet part out loud. Let's watch. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=630.44s)]
*  How much contact do you think APEC leaders have for the government of Israel? [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=634.36s)]
*  No idea. I imagine some, I think the government of Israel is often frustrated with APEC. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=639.0s)]
*  Do you think there's any- [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=644.28s)]
*  Because APEC's not nearly strong enough. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=644.9200000000001s)]
*  Do you think there's any coordination between the government of Israel and APEC? [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=645.88s)]
*  Do they talk? Sure, if you're lobbying for more US-Mexico trade, would you talk to people in [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=649.24s)]
*  the US and Mexico and the government? Sure. My question is not, is it outrageous that foreign [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=655.48s)]
*  governments lobby the United States? They all do, okay, including Israel. My only question is, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=659.8s)]
*  why don't we admit that is what's happening? You're denying it, but it's true. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=664.28s)]
*  Yeah, but because what you're saying is false. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=668.12s)]
*  Why aren't they registered as a foreign lobby? Because they're not. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=670.1999999999999s)]
*  Okay. They're not a foreign lobby. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=673.0799999999999s)]
*  No, they're not. I'm only trying to get to the question of what APEC is, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=674.8399999999999s)]
*  and I don't think you're being straightforward about it. APEC is lobbying on behalf of the [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=677.7199999999999s)]
*  interests of a foreign country and they're not registered. And you're saying, no, that's not [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=682.68s)]
*  true. You're saying that they don't coordinate with the Israeli government. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=685.9599999999999s)]
*  Coordinate, do they talk with them? I don't know what they do. I can tell you- [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=689.32s)]
*  But why don't you care? Isn't it meaningful if a foreign government- [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=693.4000000000001s)]
*  Hey, I talk with Israel all the time. I talk with foreign countries all the time. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=697.24s)]
*  But the law is, and a lot of people have been prosecuted under this law, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=700.9200000000001s)]
*  that if you are lobbying on behalf of foreign government, you must register. That's it. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=703.88s)]
*  That was incredible. Senator Cruz has never been asked those questions in an interview, ever, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=710.44s)]
*  he did not come prepared to be asked about the foreign influence of our foreign policy [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=717.96s)]
*  through groups like APEC. That was so important for a conservative or right-wing audience to hear [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=725.56s)]
*  about because it helps people to understand why policies are what they are in this country, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=734.44s)]
*  why we pursue the type of foreign policy that we pursue. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=741.72s)]
*  So I really appreciated that Tucker didn't, he had the follow ups, he held [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=744.9200000000001s)]
*  Senator Ted Cruz's feet to the fire. And I think that it was illuminating for a lot of people who [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=751.72s)]
*  might not have known the extent to which APEC basically influences our politicians to carry out [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=756.76s)]
*  policies that don't really benefit Americans, but certainly benefit the country of Israel. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=765.1600000000001s)]
*  And in a lot of cases also destabilize the Middle East, especially when we're talking [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=770.68s)]
*  about regime change wars. So I want to just quickly talk about the big lie that he tried [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=774.52s)]
*  to tell in that line of questioning, right? So Ted Cruz is like, no, no, I mean, it's not a [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=781.9599999999999s)]
*  foreign lobby. These are Americans. They're not doing any coordination with Israel. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=787.4799999999999s)]
*  But they are, but they literally are. So one of my favorite journalists, Lee Fong, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=794.04s)]
*  posted this on X. Let's take a quick look at this. So you'll see a picture there of Israeli [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=798.12s)]
*  politicians and it's a post. He quote tweeted a post by Israel Cats. And he says, Lee Fong says [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=805.72s)]
*  in his response to it, Ted Cruz told Tucker Carlson that APEC doesn't coordinate with the [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=814.36s)]
*  state of Israel, thus does not need to register under FARA. That's plainly not true. They discuss [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=820.2s)]
*  coordination openly. Here's an Israeli minister stating that he asked APEC to lobby Congress on [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=827.4s)]
*  the international criminal court issue. So Israel Cats wrote that this evening I met with APEC [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=834.4399999999999s)]
*  leaders and he names them. The state of Israel owes them much for their longstanding support. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=841.24s)]
*  I asked them to work with the administration and Congress and Congress to take dramatic steps [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=847.88s)]
*  against the decision by the prosecutor of the ICC to demand arrest warrants for Prime Minister Net [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=853.24s)]
*  Yahu and the defense minister. So, I mean, that's just open admission of coordination. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=859.56s)]
*  You have an Israeli politician openly admitting that these Israeli officials are meeting with, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=867.48s)]
*  coordinating with members of Congress in order to get the type of policies they want. And it's [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=876.12s)]
*  totally, I mean, if this were a group of Russian politicians, it would be considered [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=880.44s)]
*  foreign influence. It would be considered coordination. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=888.84s)]
*  And failure to register as a foreign agent would be a problem. It might lead to prosecution. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=893.1600000000001s)]
*  But for whatever reason, Israel tends to benefit from this weird double standard. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=899.6400000000001s)]
*  And so this is all to say that Ted Cruz, whose top campaign contributor is in fact APEC, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=905.64s)]
*  was lying. Was lying to Tucker, lying to you, lying to the entire audience. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=914.5999999999999s)]
*  Throughout his career, he has taken in $562,593 from APEC specifically. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=918.8399999999999s)]
*  Just something to know about. Now, as I know all too well, if you have specific [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=928.1199999999999s)]
*  critique or criticism of the great country of Israel, regardless of how credible or valid [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=935.4s)]
*  that criticism is, you're automatically shut down as an anti-Semite. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=941.8000000000001s)]
*  Israel defenders never substantively address the criticism or critique. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=947.24s)]
*  And so what you're about to see is Ted Cruz essentially try to pull the same tactics. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=952.52s)]
*  Let's see if it worked. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=957.4s)]
*  It's a very weird thing. The obsession with Israel. We're talking about foreign countries. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=958.2s)]
*  It's hardly an obsession. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=966.2800000000001s)]
*  You're not talking about Chinese. You're not talking about Japanese. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=967.24s)]
*  You're not talking about the British. You're not talking about the French. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=969.48s)]
*  The question, what about the Jews? What about the Jews? [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=971.48s)]
*  Oh, I'm an anti-Semite now. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=973.6400000000001s)]
*  Senator, you're asking the question, Tucker. You're asking why are the Jews controlling our [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=975.32s)]
*  foreign policy? That's what you just asked. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=980.6800000000001s)]
*  I'm hardly saying that. And I have- [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=982.44s)]
*  That is exactly what you just said. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=983.96s)]
*  Well, actually, I can speak for myself and tell you what I am saying. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=985.32s)]
*  It's interesting you're trying to derail my questions by calling me an anti-Semite, [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=988.6s)]
*  which you are. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=991.4s)]
*  I did not. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=992.04s)]
*  Of course you are. And rather than be honorable enough to say it right to my face, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=992.76s)]
*  you are in a sleazy, feline way, implying it or just asking questions about the Jews. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=997.16s)]
*  I'm not asking questions about the Jews. There's nothing to do with Jews or Judaism. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1001.64s)]
*  It has to do with the foreign government. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1006.68s)]
*  Isn't Israel controlling our foreign policy? That's not about the Jews. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1007.96s)]
*  You said- [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1010.92s)]
*  And by the way, you're the one that just called me, I think, a sleazy, feline. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1011.72s)]
*  It's sleazy to imply that I'm an anti-Semite, which you just did. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1015.8000000000001s)]
*  No, I just said why is that the only question you're asking? You answer it. Give me another [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1019.88s)]
*  reason. If you're not an anti-Semite, give me another reason why the obsession is Israel. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1023.48s)]
*  I am in no sense obsessed with Israel. We are on the brink of war with Iran. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1028.2s)]
*  And so these are valid questions. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1032.04s)]
*  Let's just briefly discuss the hilarity of someone like Ted Cruz, who just earlier said, [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1035.56s)]
*  I was voted into the Senate to be the number one representative of Israel, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1041.88s)]
*  accusing Tucker Carlson of being obsessed with Israel. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1047.24s)]
*  And by the way, at no point in this conversation did Tucker Carlson say anything about the Jews [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1053.16s)]
*  ever. And that's another tactic that gets used. I just experienced it myself when I was debating [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1063.8000000000002s)]
*  someone on her take about potentially going to war with Iran over nuclear weapons that don't [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1069.56s)]
*  even exist. All he could do was accuse me of supporting Hamas. I hate Hamas. You guys know [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1075.08s)]
*  what my comments were about Hamas after October 7th. You guys know what my comments were in regard [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1082.12s)]
*  to some of the people who are defending Hamas after October 7th. I am in no way, [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1086.76s)]
*  in no way supportive of Hamas. You love the Iranian regime. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1091.6399999999999s)]
*  No, I just don't wanna do a regime change war and further destabilize the Middle East [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1096.3600000000001s)]
*  and destabilize a country of 90 to 92 million people with no strategy, no plan in place. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1101.24s)]
*  But it shuts down the conversation real quick when someone just accuses you of being an anti-Semite. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1109.0s)]
*  And that's the one smear that for the longest time would stick to people. It would stick, [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1114.3600000000001s)]
*  even though there was no evidence of it. But I think those who use that tactic have overplayed [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1121.0s)]
*  their hand. Because now so many people have spoken out against Israel's war crimes, for instance, [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1127.88s)]
*  that everyone's been called an anti-Semite if they've had the right stance in criticizing [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1135.56s)]
*  Israel and Benjamin Netanyahu for the war crimes that have been committed. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1141.4s)]
*  So it's lost its power. And I think that as a result, it kind of empowers someone like [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1145.96s)]
*  Tucker Carlson to just be like, no, no, I'm not an anti-Semite. I know what you're doing here, [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1151.4s)]
*  answer my questions. And I really appreciated that. For whatever it's worth, this is not me [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1157.4s)]
*  providing cover for anything he said in the past. This is not me co-signing onto everything that [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1162.12s)]
*  he believes. This is me talking specifically about how he handled himself in this interview. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1166.44s)]
*  And it was fantastic. I have no problem saying it. I wish that this served as an example to all [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1171.3999999999999s)]
*  journalists, all people in this profession, because I wanna see more of this. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1178.28s)]
*  I don't want this to be so novel, but it is, it's novel. In fact, watching how he carried out this [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1182.9199999999998s)]
*  interview made me self-reflect. How can I do better? How can I challenge my interviewees [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1188.9199999999998s)]
*  and get interesting answers from them? So anyway, I thought that was an illuminating [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1197.16s)]
*  part of the conversation. I think people are waking up to the influence that the Israel lobby [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1203.3200000000002s)]
*  has. John Mearsheimer, political scientist, you may have heard of him. He does a lot of media, [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1208.0400000000002s)]
*  especially these days. He and his co-author were like run out of town because they're the [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1215.4s)]
*  ones who published that book, The Israel Lobby. It's a fantastic book. It explains [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1221.56s)]
*  how foreign policy gets made in this country, why so much of our foreign policy seems to be beneficial [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1227.24s)]
*  to Israel. And they were just automatically smeared as anti-Semites. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1232.76s)]
*  I remember reading before the book was published, there was a long essay version of the work that [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1237.72s)]
*  they were doing. And that was what we read in one of my graduate school classes. And people were so [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1244.2s)]
*  offended, but I was like, wow, this is really interesting. I mean, it's cited. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1251.6399999999999s)]
*  Obviously, they're providing receipts. This seems to be a bit of a problem. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1256.6799999999998s)]
*  But I think a lot of people are afraid of being smeared as anti-Semites, so they just kind of go [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1261.08s)]
*  along to get along. But when you do that, you're not really living in a country where your government [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1265.1599999999999s)]
*  puts you first. And I think that's a huge problem. And that's what Tucker Carlson was trying to get [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1271.48s)]
*  at there. All right, there's more, okay, because I want to get to other portions, other subjects [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1277.16s)]
*  that they discussed. So let's take a quick break. And when we come back, we'll do just that. And [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1284.0400000000002s)]
*  then we'll give you an update on the war in Iran, potential war in Iran. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1288.68s)]
*  Welcome back to the show or social break. America needs a reboot says Anna big ups to you on Abby [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1352.12s)]
*  Phillips' or Abby Phillips yesterday. Her show is called Newsnight, which I actually had to look up [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1357.3999999999999s)]
*  before promoting it on Twitter yesterday. But I actually think her show is the most interesting [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1363.1599999999999s)]
*  because it does bring a lot of different diverse ideologies together for debate. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1368.6s)]
*  And sometimes it gets really, really heated, but it didn't really get heated yesterday, [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1374.68s)]
*  which was surprising. But thank you for the compliment. I thought you were great, [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1378.44s)]
*  even though you had to navigate through that weird opinion soup format of the show. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1383.16s)]
*  I know you wanted to pimp smack that firstly. Yeah, I did not want to pimp slap anybody. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1389.16s)]
*  But I disagreed with the woman I was sitting next to in the first segment. And [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1396.76s)]
*  look, the downside of cable news shows is just how formatted it is. It's very constrained. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1401.08s)]
*  And there's so many people at that table. Everyone wants to talk. Everyone wants their turn. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1409.0s)]
*  So you don't really get to say everything you want to say. I did my best. And I'm getting a [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1414.52s)]
*  lot of props for some of the things I said, because I said things that typically are not [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1420.12s)]
*  heard on CNN, especially when it comes to Israel's nuclear weapons. For instance, I talked about some [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1423.4799999999998s)]
*  of the war crimes that Israel carried out. And it's like, okay, I mean, sure, we can talk about [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1428.92s)]
*  how scared we all are of Iran having nuclear weapons that they don't have at the moment. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1434.3600000000001s)]
*  Okay, but can we also talk about the government that's carrying out a genocide [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1442.1200000000001s)]
*  and endless war crimes with impunity that we're funding? [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1447.8000000000002s)]
*  Anyway, I didn't say it with that much attitude, but it was fun. I had a really good time. And [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1451.88s)]
*  Abby Phillip was wonderful. Tiffany Cross was just so smart, just wonderful. I really had a good time. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1457.88s)]
*  Okay, let me keep going. Art Guy says, we miss you when you're gone, Anna, but it's always good [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1466.3600000000001s)]
*  to see you kicking some backsides in other media. Thank you. Little Mac Mcgee says, afternoon TYT [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1470.76s)]
*  fam. Hope you are all well. And while I still can't stand Tucker Carlson, I have to admit, [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1477.0s)]
*  I did enjoy his showing Ted Cruz to be the utter POS that he is. Yeah, I felt the same way. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1483.32s)]
*  He's had some other interviews that I really enjoyed. He had Ben Cohen on, for instance. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1490.28s)]
*  I really love that conversation because I think Cohen is right on, it's his lifelong mission to [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1495.72s)]
*  prevent us from going to wars that we don't really need to be involved in. He's a very [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1502.2s)]
*  peace loving guy. And I thought that was a good conversation. There were other conversations as [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1507.72s)]
*  well. It's really hit or miss with that podcast. He's had religious folks on, which obviously is [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1511.32s)]
*  not really going to appeal to me. But I do like when he discusses some of these foreign policy [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1517.0s)]
*  issues because it's a different perspective. Oftentimes I disagree. Sometimes he says things [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1521.56s)]
*  that make me want to dig in a little more. All right, OctoSquiddy says, hear me now, [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1525.96s)]
*  quote me later. This is the beginning of Tucker making a run for president. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1531.24s)]
*  A lot of people think that that's what the play is here. We're going to have to wait and see. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1534.36s)]
*  And the sentiment of them. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1537.56s)]
*  And the sentiment of them. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1542.44s)]
*  And the sentiment of them. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1548.6799999999998s)]
*  And the sentiment. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1558.92s)]
*  What's up everyone? Welcome back to the show. I just want to read a few super chats before we [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1563.72s)]
*  move on to the next portion of this insanely good interview carried out by Tucker Carlson. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1570.04s)]
*  So Rage Rock for now says, I'll give Ted Cruz credit for one thing, [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1577.72s)]
*  not walking out on the conversation. The full video of those two is nearly two whole hours. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1581.24s)]
*  Fair, fair, because he was being grilled endlessly. Some people would get frustrated [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1587.24s)]
*  and they would walk off. I mean, I would never in a million years do that. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1592.68s)]
*  I think that's like a sign of weakness. I would if I'm being genuinely disrespected, [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1596.3600000000001s)]
*  although I've experienced that recently and I did not walk off set. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1603.0s)]
*  Because I actually wanted to debate the substance of the topic we were debating. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1606.28s)]
*  But let's go to some other comments. Cthulhu says, happy birthday. Me, Anna, happy birthday. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1609.48s)]
*  Our birthdays are kind of close. Mine's coming up, unfortunately. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1619.3200000000002s)]
*  New members, welcome to Sessin Sessin Sys and also Sarah Bartlett. Thank you for being members. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1623.0s)]
*  I hope you guys enjoy the show. We got a lot more content to get to. So without further ado, [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1632.6000000000001s)]
*  let's get to one other or two other parts of this interview that I think is worth [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1637.0s)]
*  drawing attention to. So during Tucker Carlson's interview of Texas Senator [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1641.88s)]
*  Ted Cruz, one of our favorites, the topic of the Bible came up. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1650.6s)]
*  And usually I wouldn't be all that interested. I want to hear two grown men talking about the [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1655.32s)]
*  Bible, right? It's not for me, it's for other people. However, Ted Cruz brought up the Bible [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1659.48s)]
*  in the context of why he supports the country of Israel so aggressively. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1666.44s)]
*  Fair enough. Now, one thing that I know for sure about Tucker Carlson is that he is a man of faith. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1673.72s)]
*  He's not faking it. He talks about his faith all the time. And since he's knowledgeable about [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1678.92s)]
*  the Bible, he thought he would challenge Ted Cruz a little bit. So without further ado, [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1685.4s)]
*  let's take a look. Growing up in Sunday school, I was taught from the Bible. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1689.24s)]
*  Those who bless Israel will be blessed and those who curse Israel will be cursed. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1694.52s)]
*  And from my perspective, I want to be on the blessing side of things. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1699.4s)]
*  Those who bless the government of Israel? [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1702.92s)]
*  Those who bless Israel is what it says. It doesn't say the government of it says the [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1704.76s)]
*  nation of Israel. So that's in the Bible. As a Christian, I believe that. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1707.48s)]
*  Where is that? I can find it to you. I don't have the [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1711.96s)]
*  scripture off the tip of my, you pull out the phone and use the- [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1715.24s)]
*  It's in Genesis, but so you're quoting a Bible phrase. You don't have context for it. You don't [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1718.68s)]
*  know where in the Bible it is, but that's like your theology. I'm confused. What does that even mean? [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1723.88s)]
*  Tucker. I'm a Christian. I want to know what you're talking about. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1728.92s)]
*  Okay. Where does my support for Israel come from? Number one, because biblically, [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1731.88s)]
*  we're commanded to support Israel. But number two- [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1738.2s)]
*  Hold on. No, no, no, no. Hold on. You're a senator and now you're throwing out theology, [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1740.3600000000001s)]
*  and I am a Christian. I am allowed to weigh in on this. We are commanded as Christians to support [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1744.6000000000001s)]
*  the government of Israel? We are commanded to support Israel. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1748.68s)]
*  Is the nation God's referring to in Genesis, is that the same as the country run by Benjamin [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1751.64s)]
*  Netanyahu right now? Yes, yes. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1756.76s)]
*  It is. Okay. That is psychotic. Okay. What Ted Cruz said there is psychotic. Really, [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1758.2s)]
*  you're going to hide behind the Bible to explain your unwavering commitment to a man [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1767.24s)]
*  who's running a government that's carrying out a genocide right now? Really? That's what your [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1775.72s)]
*  theology is. See, people like Ted Cruz, unfortunately, for those who are actually [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1780.6s)]
*  genuine about their faith, a detriment. People like Ted Cruz turn people off to religion. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1787.08s)]
*  I mean, obviously, there are other reasons why people don't believe in religion. They [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1794.6799999999998s)]
*  might be agnostic, atheist, spiritual, whatever. But part of the reason why I personally got [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1797.8s)]
*  turned off by Christianity, which by the way, I grew up going to Sunday school every Sunday [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1804.9199999999998s)]
*  from like three to 19. Okay. At no point did I learn in Sunday school that to be a good Christian, [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1810.28s)]
*  you have to support the government of Israel. Ted Cruz just made that up. He just made that up. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1820.12s)]
*  And so he's hiding behind his religion to carry out whatever he wants to carry out. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1826.68s)]
*  For whatever reason he wants to carry it out. I mean, obviously, he's backed by APAC to a pretty [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1832.44s)]
*  significant degree. Has taken more than half a million dollars in campaign contributions from [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1837.0s)]
*  them throughout his Senate career. But don't hide behind your religion, bro. Just tell the truth. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1841.16s)]
*  I mean, tell us why you think it's so important to prioritize a foreign country over the country [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1850.84s)]
*  that you were elected to serve. I love the fact that Tucker Carlson challenged him on that. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1856.44s)]
*  Because I don't know, I'm not in Tucker's head, so I can only speculate. If you are sincere about [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1862.76s)]
*  your faith as Tucker is, hearing someone like Ted Cruz cite Christianity, especially in this context [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1868.52s)]
*  of what the Israeli government is currently doing. To provide cover for what the Israeli [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1876.28s)]
*  government is currently doing. It's just unacceptable. It really is. I would be so [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1880.68s)]
*  offended by that if I were still a practicing Christian. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1886.12s)]
*  But it doesn't end there. It really doesn't end there. I mean, there were so many topics [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1891.3999999999999s)]
*  that came up and I wanna go to one more. Because this one has really been grating on my nerves. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1895.72s)]
*  And I'm gonna say that both political parties are absolutely guilty of perpetuating [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1900.92s)]
*  what I suspect to be a lie because we haven't seen a shred of evidence on it. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1907.3999999999999s)]
*  So let me set this up. So [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1911.96s)]
*  Senator Ted Cruz is getting interviewed by Tucker Carlson, lengthy two hour interview. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1916.76s)]
*  They touched on so many different topics. But then, obviously, because of what's happening [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1921.16s)]
*  geopolitically right now, the issue of a potential regime change war with Iran came up. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1925.48s)]
*  So at that point, Tucker Carlson just wanted some information from Ted Cruz about, [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1931.88s)]
*  there's this narrative that Iran has tried to assassinate the president. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1937.88s)]
*  And I just wanna know more about that. What's the evidence? Has anyone been arrested? [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1944.3600000000001s)]
*  And honestly, my favorite part about all of this is just watching Senator Cruz go from being [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1949.8s)]
*  so confident, unearned confidence to just squirming, squirming like crazy. So let's watch. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1956.2s)]
*  What is true is Iran is trying to assassinate Donald J Trump and they have hired hitmen. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1963.24s)]
*  Now you pointed out- No, he said that they had tried twice to kill him. And I don't know that, [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1968.36s)]
*  I don't have any evidence that's true. But I sort of wonder if that is true, [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1974.4399999999998s)]
*  why aren't we aware of them already? You rightly pointed out there's no evidence that this [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1977.08s)]
*  clown in Butler, Pennsylvania, who shot the president was working for the Iranians. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1982.12s)]
*  I don't think he was, there's no evidence of that. But what is true and what your [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1985.8s)]
*  newsletter didn't acknowledge, is it true or false that Iran is currently trying to murder [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1989.24s)]
*  Donald J Trump and has paid hitmen to do so? Well, that's the question and I don't know, [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1992.84s)]
*  the Butler, Pennsylvania thing. Let's just put that aside, I don't know. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=1998.2s)]
*  So Netanyahu misspoke when he said those two assassinations were because of Iran. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2002.6s)]
*  But what he was saying that is right is they're actively trying to murder Donald J Trump. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2006.68s)]
*  Is there, okay, so you're aware of a plot to kill Trump? [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2011.0s)]
*  Yes, that Iran is paying for. And by the way- [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2015.08s)]
*  When? It has been over the last, I'd say 18 months to two years. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2017.8s)]
*  In the United States? In the United States, yes. And let me point out- [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2022.2s)]
*  Has anyone been arrested? For the Trump attempted assassination, no. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2025.88s)]
*  If there's a plot to kill Trump by the Iranians- Okay, so you dispute that the Iranians are trying [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2031.4s)]
*  to kill Trump? Of course, I mean, that's the most important question. The Prime Minister of Israel [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2036.68s)]
*  just said there have been two assassination attempts against Donald Trump by the Iranians. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2041.88s)]
*  And I think it's a very fair question. Maybe you disagree to ask, what are you talking about? [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2047.3200000000002s)]
*  Okay. And I agree with you that he misspoke. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2052.2000000000003s)]
*  Okay, genuinely, because I might be missing it. And if I'm missing it, [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2057.88s)]
*  I want to make sure I give the appropriate people credit. Has anyone else other than people like [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2061.32s)]
*  us at TYT and maybe a few other independent people and independent media, has anyone else [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2068.12s)]
*  asked for evidence of these claims that Iran is plotting to assassinate President Donald Trump? [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2074.12s)]
*  Whether they're on the left or the right in media, whether we're talking about politicians, [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2083.16s)]
*  by the way, because I remember the first allegation that Iran was plotting to assassinate [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2087.32s)]
*  Trump came in the context of the Biden administration. And then just recently, [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2092.2s)]
*  you have the most dishonest person imaginable in terms of being a leader of a country, [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2097.32s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu. I mean, the guy's been lying to us for literally decades. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2104.6000000000004s)]
*  He's been telling us that Iran is about to have nuclear weapons for 33 years. That guy lies. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2108.6000000000004s)]
*  So right now, he wants the United States to carry out offensive strikes against Iran. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2118.44s)]
*  Not only do they want us to give them these insane bunker buster bombs that cost $3.5 million each [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2124.6s)]
*  that are like 30,000 pounds, okay? Homeboy wants us to actually engage in a regime change war. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2131.64s)]
*  The nuclear stuff, that's just the cover. That's just the cover. This is all about [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2140.3599999999997s)]
*  overthrowing the Ayatollah with really no plan in place, no idea of what comes after. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2146.68s)]
*  So in order to egg people like Trump on, the Iranians, they're planning to assassinate you. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2151.16s)]
*  Okay, can we see the evidence? Can we see the evidence? And get a load of Senator Cruz. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2161.08s)]
*  Get a load of Senator Cruz. Once he's backed into a corner, [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2166.7599999999998s)]
*  he provides cover for Netanyahu. Well, Netanyahu, you misspoke. He misspoke. Did he? [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2171.08s)]
*  Did he misspeak? Doubt it. I doubt he misspoke. I really hope that Trump isn't as buffoonish [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2177.08s)]
*  as I think he is, and he doesn't fall for these ridiculous lies from Netanyahu. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2185.56s)]
*  We're gonna have to wait and see, but he has not inspired much confidence. He really hasn't. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2191.4s)]
*  And so we'll wait and see. But I am so sick of these insane, outlandish claims being made [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2197.3199999999997s)]
*  by people in positions of power, by foreign leaders, without providing even a shred of [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2206.3599999999997s)]
*  evidence to back it up. And what Tucker Carlson was trying to get at here, and I thought it was a [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2212.12s)]
*  masterful strategy. If you listen to the entirety of that portion of their conversation, he was [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2217.7999999999997s)]
*  basically trying to make a point about how, okay, so let me get this straight. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2226.7599999999998s)]
*  There have been assassination plots against the United States president [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2230.84s)]
*  by a foreign country, a foreign government. And we're not at all interested in going to [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2237.32s)]
*  war with them over that. But we wanna do a regime change war in Iran over nuclear weapons that don't [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2243.56s)]
*  exist. That was the bottom line. And Ted Cruz realized it. And I think he realized [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2251.72s)]
*  how laughable that idea is. That we would be more concerned about a prime minister who's been lying [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2261.64s)]
*  to us for 33 years about Iran having nuclear weapons or coming close to having nuclear weapons. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2269.7999999999997s)]
*  We'd be more concerned about that, carrying out a potential regime change war. By the way, [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2273.7999999999997s)]
*  Ted Cruz wants that regime change war in Iran. He does. So he is in favor of military engagement [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2278.28s)]
*  in a regime change war in Iran to appease Israel. But if he genuinely thought, if he really believed [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2287.0800000000004s)]
*  that Iran was plotting to assassinate Donald Trump, wouldn't he wanna go to war with Iran over that? [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2294.84s)]
*  Wouldn't he wanna do something about that? [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2301.4s)]
*  I thought that was so well done by Tucker Carlson. I don't believe that there's any evidence [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2303.08s)]
*  Iran wanting to or having any plans or plots to assassinate the president of the United States. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2313.4s)]
*  I could be wrong, but I'm not just going to believe what government officials tell me. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2320.84s)]
*  I'll never believe a word that comes out of Netanyahu's mouth ever, ever, ever. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2326.12s)]
*  I need to see the receipts. And quite frankly, we haven't seen any receipts. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2330.2s)]
*  So there you have it. That was so well done. I highly recommend you guys check out the whole [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2336.2s)]
*  conversation. Of course, look, I get it. In America, our political system, our politicians, [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2341.8799999999997s)]
*  people in positions of power, they do cynical, gross things all the time. So I get it. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2350.2799999999997s)]
*  It's hard to ever believe that someone who seemed so dug into his neoconservative ideology [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2354.68s)]
*  has changed. I'm starting to believe that on those foreign policy issues, Tucker Carlson really has [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2364.9199999999996s)]
*  changed. He talks about his remorse for being a neocon all the time. And at some point, [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2370.68s)]
*  you just have to believe him. There's been enough time, enough years of him questioning [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2377.64s)]
*  US foreign policy for me to actually believe him when he says he's concerned about getting [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2383.88s)]
*  engaged in these wars that we shouldn't be engaged in while our country falls apart. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2389.8s)]
*  So anyway, check out the whole conversation. Obviously not right now because we've got other [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2394.44s)]
*  stories to get to, which we will do after we come back from this break. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2398.6s)]
*  And [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2443.88s)]
*  that was Bart with the drop. Okay, that was hilarious. Okay, Stinky Stinky Feet writes in [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2462.12s)]
*  and says Ted Cruz is a sneaky, slimy, sticky, squirmy, wormy, slick, sweaty, stinky, corrupt [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2465.88s)]
*  politician. Who in Texas keeps reelecting this guy and why? Shaking my head. I don't know. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2471.96s)]
*  I really don't know. YTP Renewed says to be fair, the Bible portrays God as genocidal, [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2479.4s)]
*  certainly in the Old Testament. I hear what you're saying, but clearly what Ted Cruz was [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2487.08s)]
*  talking about was different. In fact, let me go to our members section because there were some [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2494.12s)]
*  really good comments about that. Actually, this is our Twitch community where PB Cupcake says, [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2498.04s)]
*  amazing that the Bible could see the creation of Israel 2,000 years in the future. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2504.44s)]
*  Hilarious. Galfar says, I do not care why Tucker is, I think this is a typo. I do not care why [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2508.6s)]
*  Tucker is deying. He is against the USA, what he's doing or saying. Okay, there we go. He's [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2517.72s)]
*  against the USA jumping into this war, just that he can convince his viewers to also be against it. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2524.68s)]
*  Galfar, yes, yes, yes. Thank you. Thank you for seeing the benefit of what he's doing here. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2533.72s)]
*  I mean, I've talked about this before. I've done this show for 18 years and [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2542.68s)]
*  we have a very left-wing audience, which I love, but you're not gonna change anything [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2546.8399999999997s)]
*  until you win over the hearts and minds of people who tend to disagree with you, right? [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2552.04s)]
*  You have to reach across the aisle. And I'm not talking about it in the context of [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2556.2799999999997s)]
*  congressional Democrats capitulating to corporate Republicans. That's not what I'm talking about. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2561.0s)]
*  I'm talking about ordinary people, right? If you wanna win on policy, you're gonna have to [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2565.08s)]
*  unite with people that you have common ground with on some of the issues, right? So in this case, [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2570.2s)]
*  if we can work with some component of Trump's base, conservatives, whatever it is, I don't care. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2577.0s)]
*  I don't even care what their political identity is. If we agree on wanting to prevent a regime [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2585.08s)]
*  change war in Iran, then we should find strategies and ways to work together to prevent that from [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2590.84s)]
*  happening. And I do think that what Tucker Carlson is doing right now is essentially getting really [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2596.04s)]
*  important information to a conservative audience, and I love that. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2600.92s)]
*  All right, let's go to Metal Turtle 571 who says, Tuck is doing the Bannon right now. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2605.96s)]
*  If I can't be in the club, I'm gonna burn this bitch to the ground. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2611.32s)]
*  I would have previously thought that, but I think part of the reason why Murdoch basically threw [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2618.84s)]
*  Tucker under the bus when you have people like Maria Bartiromo who said far worse lies and was [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2625.08s)]
*  also named in that Dominion lawsuit. I think the reason why is because Tucker was increasingly [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2632.12s)]
*  doing more and more of these isolationist type segments and monologues. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2636.52s)]
*  Okay, when we talk about the Neocon boomers at the helm, at the top of that list is Rupert Murdoch. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2641.72s)]
*  Okay, Bart needs to save that one because I think that might be my favorite now. Okay, [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2655.08s)]
*  the random bacon drop was so good. Anyway, that's bacon. That was a DJ Bart Kyle on the ones and [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2679.8s)]
*  twos. Now let's stop having fun because we're about to talk about war with Iran. So we've got [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2686.2000000000003s)]
*  some updates on that. I don't wanna forget about what's happening in Gaza as we're barreling closer [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2692.76s)]
*  to a war with Iran because the people of Gaza should not be forgotten. So we're gonna get to [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2698.92s)]
*  that as well. Let's start with the updates on Iran though. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2703.56s)]
*  Thank you, President. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2706.68s)]
*  Have you given answer questions about whether you are moving closer or you believe the US is moving [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2709.0s)]
*  closer to striking Iranian nuclear facilities? Where's your mind now? [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2714.2799999999997s)]
*  Well, obviously I can't say that, right? You know, seriously, I think I'm gonna answer that question. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2717.7999999999997s)]
*  Will you strike the Iranian nuclear component? And what time exactly, Sarah? Sarah, would you strike it? [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2722.68s)]
*  Will you please inform us so we can be there and watch? [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2730.2s)]
*  But would you say you're closer to wanting to do it? [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2732.52s)]
*  You don't know that I'm gonna even do it. You don't know. I may do it, I may not do it. I mean, [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2733.72s)]
*  nobody knows what I'm gonna do. I can tell you this, that Iran's got a lot of trouble. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2737.64s)]
*  Well, he's right about one thing. No one knows what he's gonna do because our president is [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2745.48s)]
*  not guided by any particular ideology, feels like he shoots from the hip. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2750.44s)]
*  And even though a huge component of his base consists of individuals who do not want war [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2756.28s)]
*  and specifically voted for him because they don't want war. He might wake up tomorrow and say, [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2763.7200000000003s)]
*  you know what? I wanna bomb Iran. Why not? He might do it tonight. I might get another surprise [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2770.04s)]
*  during our bonus episode today. But nonetheless, that was our President Donald Trump at the White [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2776.6s)]
*  House this morning, just flippantly responding to a question about whether or not the United States [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2782.44s)]
*  is about to engage in a hot offensive war with Iran, which would be, in my opinion, [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2789.4s)]
*  a complete and utter disaster. Now, last night he posted on social media that we have total and [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2794.92s)]
*  complete control of the skies above Iran following a post that simply said, this is so clownish, [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2802.04s)]
*  unconditional surrender in all caps. Okay, so let's just pause and talk about the stupidity of this, [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2810.52s)]
*  the stupidity of the ask, okay? [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2816.76s)]
*  So Israel carries out a surprise offensive attack on Iran. They take out nuclear scientists, [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2820.84s)]
*  high level officials, civilians died because they also made sure to bomb the nuclear scientists [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2830.36s)]
*  home as they were at home sleeping with their families, entire apartment buildings. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2837.64s)]
*  So there were other, I mean, hundreds of people have already been killed in Iran. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2842.3599999999997s)]
*  What would make Donald Trump think that Iran, which let's not pretend like Iran is not [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2846.6s)]
*  a country with decent military capability. Why wouldn't they wanna defend themselves? [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2855.24s)]
*  Why would they agree to continue negotiations? And by the way, what does unconditional surrender [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2861.4s)]
*  even mean? It's just, this is what I mean when I say that he is not really guided by any particular [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2866.92s)]
*  ideology or strategy. Sometimes that yields interesting results, sometimes it yields [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2875.16s)]
*  devastating results, and that's what I'm worried about here. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2880.2000000000003s)]
*  So he was asked by reporters what exactly that meant and well, his answer wasn't really reassuring. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2883.08s)]
*  What does unconditional surrender mean? Can you explain it for those who don't? [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2890.12s)]
*  It's a very simple, unconditional surrender. That means I've had it, okay? I've had it, [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2897.7999999999997s)]
*  I give up, no more. Then we go blow up all the nuclear stuff that's all over the place. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2903.24s)]
*  They're totally defenseless. They have no air defense whatsoever. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2910.2s)]
*  Totally, totally captured the air. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2915.0s)]
*  We're gonna bomb a lot of their nuclear stuff. It's all over the place. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2921.08s)]
*  Multiple sources, including a senior intelligence official and a Department of Defense official [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2927.64s)]
*  told media outlets last night that the US is indeed seriously considering getting involved in [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2933.48s)]
*  the offensive against Iran. And if we do, by the way, one possible target is a nuclear site that [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2940.52s)]
*  I'm sure you guys have heard of before. It's the Forto site. And it's an underground [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2947.64s)]
*  uranium enrichment site that's believed to be the most likely location for a hypothetical, [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2953.32s)]
*  hypothetical nuclear weapons program. Because guys, [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2960.6s)]
*  Wall Street Journal actually published an incredible piece yesterday. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2965.16s)]
*  And in that piece, they go into the details of how the Israelis [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2969.24s)]
*  had shared intel with the United States, with the Trump administration, [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2973.4s)]
*  indicating that Iran was weeks away from having nuclear weapons. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2977.8s)]
*  And you wanna know something? The Trump administration rejected it because it totally [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2984.44s)]
*  conflicted with what our intelligence community had found. And I'm sure you guys have seen that [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2989.8s)]
*  video of the director of the Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=2996.28s)]
*  She's speaking before Congress and she's like, there's no indication that they're building a [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3003.1600000000003s)]
*  nuclear weapon. She did admit that they've enriched uranium quite a bit to 60%. You need it 90% [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3007.7200000000003s)]
*  in order to have weapons grade uranium. But she even addressed the 2003 suspension [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3014.6800000000003s)]
*  of Iran's nuclear program. She notes that the Ayatollah did not lift that suspension. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3023.16s)]
*  They haven't started building any type of nuclear weapon. I mean, obviously, [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3029.48s)]
*  there's conflicting intel here. We have US intel and then you have intel coming from the Israelis [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3034.04s)]
*  who want us to go to war on their behalf. And anyone who tries to gaslight you and tell you [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3041.24s)]
*  that's not true. Look, all you have to do is go on X, go on social media, [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3046.04s)]
*  follow what some of these Israeli politicians are saying. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3052.44s)]
*  There was a picture I came across today on X featuring these big banners that were posted [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3057.0s)]
*  in Israel, essentially encouraging President Trump to join the war. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3062.68s)]
*  I mean, look, Israel cannot defeat Iran by itself. And Netanyahu knew that, which is why he did this [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3067.24s)]
*  surprise attack. And he's hoping that the US gets dragged into it and that Trump is going to be [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3076.7599999999998s)]
*  forced to help Israel. I don't think that they're gonna be able to defeat Iran. I'm just keeping it [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3083.48s)]
*  real. I think they might destroy Iran. But I don't know what happened to the Houthis in Yemen. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3090.68s)]
*  Houthis guys, Houthis are backed by Iran. It's an Iranian proxy in Yemen. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3097.16s)]
*  We went to war with them for years and we didn't defeat them. So what gives anyone the idea that [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3105.3999999999996s)]
*  it would be a cakewalk? That it would just be maybe a few months. Do a quick little regime [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3114.36s)]
*  change sesh. No, no, it would be incredibly difficult. A lot of innocent people would die. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3121.0s)]
*  You would need boots on the ground. You can't do what Israel's doing with aerial bombardments of [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3126.2000000000003s)]
*  Gaza, along with shooting hungry Palestinians to death as they're at humanitarian aid hubs, [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3130.28s)]
*  hoping to get their hands on some flowers so they don't die. But this is crazy. This is absolutely [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3136.6000000000004s)]
*  insane. So American assistance could, by the way, include providing air cover for Israeli [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3143.16s)]
*  commandos who go into Iran on the ground. But officials said the more probable outcome is a [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3151.16s)]
*  strike by US B-2 stealth bombers armed with the massive ordnance penetrator, a weapon that [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3158.68s)]
*  theoretically has the ability to bore into the mountain that shelters the underground [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3167.48s)]
*  Fordo facility. People think that this is a crazy thing to say. I don't think it's crazy anymore [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3174.28s)]
*  at all. You have to keep in mind that a lot of countries that are governed in ways that we don't [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3181.16s)]
*  agree with, like Pakistan, for instance. Pakistan has nukes. Yeah. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3185.8s)]
*  Israel does not want Iran to have a deterrent, and nuclear weapons are deterrents. And quite [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3189.16s)]
*  frankly, look, there's no evidence that they're close to building a nuclear weapon. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3198.92s)]
*  Even if they were at 90% enriched uranium today, it would still take them many months, [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3202.8399999999997s)]
*  maybe even several years to be able to build the nuclear weapons. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3209.3199999999997s)]
*  So I'm not even worried about them having a nuclear weapon right now. However, let's say [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3213.64s)]
*  worst case scenario for the Israelis, they have a nuclear weapon already. Do I think they're going [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3218.68s)]
*  to drop a nuke on Israel? No, I don't. I don't think they're gonna do that. I think they are [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3223.24s)]
*  under the impression that Israel is out of control, is currently governed by a belligerent prime [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3229.24s)]
*  minister along with other members of that government, some of whom have been convicted of [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3234.68s)]
*  terrorism, wanting to just wreck that region of the world on their behalf. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3239.7999999999997s)]
*  It's just ridiculous. So don't you think that some of Israel's behavior might encourage a [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3247.48s)]
*  country like Iran, which has been the target, the focus of Benjamin Netanyahu for 33 years? [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3253.2400000000002s)]
*  Don't you think they might wanna build a weapon to deter someone like Netanyahu from invading? [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3258.76s)]
*  And yes, I know, I know. Iranians in the past, especially under Ahmadinejad, [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3266.44s)]
*  who is no longer the president of Iran, okay, he's been out of power for a long time. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3273.16s)]
*  You would hear the chants of like death to America. But if we're gonna start engaging in [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3277.24s)]
*  regime change wars over chance, does that mean, hey, you know what? The Israeli government, [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3282.4399999999996s)]
*  a lot of those politicians have said some pretty crazy genocidal thing. Should we invade that [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3289.8799999999997s)]
*  country? It's just so dumb. And that's the only answer. It's always war. War is the only answer. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3294.2799999999997s)]
*  War is the only answer. And Trump pressuring Iran to engage in diplomatic talks to get a new [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3302.2s)]
*  nuclear deal, look, I wanna encourage that because I don't want war. But can he at least, [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3310.4399999999996s)]
*  at least for once in his life, recognize that ripping up the JCPOA, the original nuclear deal [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3317.56s)]
*  with Iran, was a complete and utter disaster? This guy loves to break things. And then if he [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3324.4399999999996s)]
*  succeeds in fixing it, he gives himself props like, I broke what I fixed. I fixed what I broke. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3330.68s)]
*  But in this case, it doesn't appear he's gonna be able to fix it. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3336.8399999999997s)]
*  Again, as we've said many times, despite Netanyahu's repeated claims that Iran is [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3341.24s)]
*  days away from acquiring a nuclear weapon, that is not true based on actual facts. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3346.52s)]
*  So a US intelligence assessment from earlier this year found that Iran is not building nuclear [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3351.72s)]
*  weapons. That was what Tulsi Gabbard was testifying about in Congress. And just [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3357.16s)]
*  yesterday, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3361.8799999999997s)]
*  which the Israelis love to cite lately, doubled down on those findings. That's interesting. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3366.44s)]
*  Let's take a look. I mean, there is this competition about who is wrong or right about [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3372.7599999999998s)]
*  the time that would be needed. Certainly, it was not for tomorrow, maybe not a matter of years. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3379.48s)]
*  I would there be perhaps more serious about this, and I don't think it was a matter of years. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3386.76s)]
*  But this is speculation. Why? These things we don't know. Because if there was some activity [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3393.2400000000002s)]
*  which was clandestine or hidden or away from our inspectors, we couldn't know. What we informed [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3399.96s)]
*  and what we reported was that we did not have, as in coincidence with some of the sources you [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3406.6800000000003s)]
*  mentioned there, that we did not have any proof of a systematic effort to move into a nuclear weapon. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3414.52s)]
*  But Israel has conflicting intel. I mean, they don't have a conflict of interest or anything, [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3426.7599999999998s)]
*  so we should just believe that and then go to war with Iran. Absolute insanity, like so crazy. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3434.68s)]
*  Let's also not forget that Iran has been part of the nonproliferation treaty. Israel has not. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3441.0s)]
*  Also, Israel is the one with nuclear weapons that they don't acknowledge. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3449.4s)]
*  And the fact that they're not in the nonproliferation treaty, the fact that they [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3455.48s)]
*  do not have international inspectors come in as they do with a country that might be developing [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3459.4s)]
*  a nuclear weapon. The double standard drives me crazy. And by the way, why does Israel have [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3465.24s)]
*  nuclear weapons? Do I think Israel is genuinely gonna use nuclear weapons? [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3471.3199999999997s)]
*  No, they've learned other ways to kill off possibly an entire ethnic group. However, [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3475.64s)]
*  I know that Israel probably has those nukes as a deterrent. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3482.2s)]
*  I don't wanna live in a world where nukes even exist. I hate nuclear weapons. I wish we could [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3487.16s)]
*  just get rid of them across the board, but we don't live in that world. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3492.12s)]
*  And when you have an aggressor in the region, and yes, Israel is the aggressor in this region, [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3496.04s)]
*  and they're constantly trying to annex parts of Middle Eastern countries as they've done with [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3500.8399999999997s)]
*  Syria. They've tried to do with Lebanon. Obviously, they've been occupying the West Bank. They're [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3505.56s)]
*  gonna take it over entirely, annex that. They're gonna annex Gaza. Don't you think that maybe the [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3510.3599999999997s)]
*  belligerence of the government of Israel is encouraging or could encourage other countries [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3516.6s)]
*  in the region to desire a deterrent like a nuclear weapon? [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3523.64s)]
*  Things don't just happen in a vacuum. We have to talk about cause and effect here. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3528.2799999999997s)]
*  But we live in America and we're discouraged from doing that when it comes to this specific [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3532.2799999999997s)]
*  context, when it's involving Israel. We should not go to war. It would be such a disaster at [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3536.52s)]
*  a time when we can't afford it, our country's falling apart. This would be lunacy. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3544.84s)]
*  But getting back to the escalating conflict, unsurprisingly, after Trump ramped up his [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3549.96s)]
*  threatening rhetoric yesterday, that's when he did so, Iranian leader Ayatollah Khamenei [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3554.28s)]
*  responded in kind because that's what happens. Let's take a look. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3560.76s)]
*  The President of the United States, in unacceptable remarks, explicitly calls on the Iranian nation to [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3563.64s)]
*  surrender. But we say to him, first, make threats to those who are afraid of them. Threats have [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3570.52s)]
*  never influenced the behavior or thinking of the Iranian people. Second, telling the Iranian nation [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3576.2s)]
*  to surrender is not a rational statement. Wise individuals who are familiar with the Iranian [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3581.64s)]
*  people and their history would never utter such words because the Iranian nation is not one that [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3586.68s)]
*  surrenders and will never submit to anyone's aggression. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3592.2s)]
*  Okay. Right. And again, what does surrender even mean? What does that even mean? Hey, [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3595.16s)]
*  listen, bro, we'd rather not spend trillions of dollars in a prolonged regime change war with [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3603.3999999999996s)]
*  you. So can we just skip ahead to the regime change without the war? Which, by the way, [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3609.64s)]
*  I mean, that would be amazing and miraculous if that happened, but that would never happen. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3615.3199999999997s)]
*  That would never happen. All right. So meanwhile, let's talk a little bit about [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3618.84s)]
*  the war hawkery that's happening in this country because the battle between the isolationists and [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3624.1200000000003s)]
*  the war hawks is continuing to heat up. And honestly, that is a silver lining in this whole [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3628.92s)]
*  situation because it does prove to me that there is a portion of Trump's base. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3634.6000000000004s)]
*  More importantly, I'm talking about the voters. But even in elected office, you have some politicians [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3641.7200000000003s)]
*  who are willing to push back against this narrative that's being forced upon us by Israel, [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3647.4s)]
*  by the war hawks. So anyway, this is one of my favorite videos. I watched it several times in [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3653.6400000000003s)]
*  a row because it's like a parody of himself. This is Mark Levin. He's one of the top war hawks. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3659.48s)]
*  He was on Fox last night. Get a load of this guy. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3665.32s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3668.68s)]
*  Donald Trump is a forever war president. How so? He's gonna do it. Every president before him, [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3669.88s)]
*  since Carter didn't have the guts to do. He's gonna put an end to this damn thing. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3675.64s)]
*  And that's what needs to happen. That's not a warmonger. That's a peacemaker. That is a man [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3680.2s)]
*  who's gonna make sure this generation and future generations are protected from nuclear missiles [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3685.4s)]
*  coming out of the Middle East from barbarian primitives from the seventh century. That's what [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3692.36s)]
*  he wants to do. And then I hear the questions. Well, won't this create a bigger war? Really, [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3698.04s)]
*  with who? The Israelis are kicking their asses left and right. The US hasn't even gotten involved [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3703.24s)]
*  directly. Yeah, so where are they? They're nowhere. How about China? Nowhere. How about Russia? [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3707.88s)]
*  Nowhere. What happened to World War III? There is no World War III. They all sound like a bunch of [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3714.04s)]
*  Marxist Islamists. They don't sound like patriotic Americans. Let me be clear. This is good versus [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3719.32s)]
*  evil. You're either a patriotic American who's gonna get behind the president of the United [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3724.92s)]
*  States, the commander in chief, or you're not. Folks, this is black and white. You're either on [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3729.32s)]
*  the side of the red, white, and blue, or you're on the other side. It's that simple. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3734.12s)]
*  Marxist Islamists. Why is he yelling? Why is he always animated? I get it. Look, [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3737.64s)]
*  we live in a glass house, especially Jake. Jake more than me. But I get heated. It's usually [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3747.48s)]
*  tied to something that's making me angry. In this case, you have Mark Levin, [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3753.96s)]
*  who seems to be getting what he wants. Why are you still angry? [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3760.92s)]
*  And let's talk about barbaric behavior. Let's do that. Because let's focus on Iran first, [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3766.76s)]
*  because there is barbaric behavior in Iran. I'm not an idiot, okay? I don't think that the entirety [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3775.08s)]
*  of Iran is this backwards, terrible country. People are primitive. No, I don't believe that [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3782.12s)]
*  at all. It's actually a pretty diverse country. The people of Iran absolutely do want different [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3789.16s)]
*  leadership. They do want regime change, but they do not want Israel to come in and do it. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3796.52s)]
*  They're terrified of that. By the way, how is Israel trying to do this? Hundreds of people, [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3800.7599999999998s)]
*  innocent people, have already been killed. I'm not talking about the targets that Israel was [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3805.0s)]
*  focusing on. I'm talking about all the innocent civilians who have already died in Iran as a [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3811.0s)]
*  result of these strikes. They're not in any way wanting Israel to come in and install some [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3815.0s)]
*  puppet government. So let's just get that out of the way, because I keep seeing Israel defenders [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3822.36s)]
*  and people who want this war come to me like, look at this poll. Look at what the Iranian people are [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3829.08s)]
*  saying. They want this. No, no, they say they want regime change. Not done by you. Not done by you. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3833.32s)]
*  Very simple. Anyway, then you have the other bar. Oh yeah, so in Iran, look, we covered that story [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3841.0s)]
*  of the young woman who was executed because she wasn't wearing her headdress perfectly. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3850.84s)]
*  A little bit of her hair was showing. She was imprisoned. There are mass protests around it, [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3857.8s)]
*  and eventually she was executed. And that was so barbaric and so gross. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3862.6s)]
*  And a lot of countries across the globe do barbaric and gross things. We don't threaten to [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3867.64s)]
*  invade them. We don't risk the lives of our soldiers to invade them. It's not our job to [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3872.12s)]
*  be the world's police. But now let's talk about the barbarism and barbaric behavior on the other [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3878.76s)]
*  side. Are the Israelis who are currently carrying out a genocide in Gaza really gonna tell us [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3884.2s)]
*  about how this is a war between civilization and barbarism? [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3889.08s)]
*  Who are the barbarians here? Because I see a lot of barbaric activity happening [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3897.16s)]
*  and carried out by the IDF. Dude, they bombed the Iranian embassy in Syria. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3904.04s)]
*  They bombed it. Think about how crazy that is. And in retaliation, you wanna know what Iran did, [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3911.48s)]
*  that scary country that's gonna drop a nuke on the United States and Israel. You wanna know what they [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3917.32s)]
*  did in retaliation? They waited a while, and then they let the United States and Israel know, [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3921.72s)]
*  72 hours in advance, we're going to do these drone strikes. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3927.3199999999997s)]
*  Here's where the drone strikes are gonna be. The US shot them down, not a single civilian was harmed, [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3933.16s)]
*  not a single person was harmed. There was a little bit of property damage. But what are we doing here? [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3939.3999999999996s)]
*  Are we really pretending the Israelis and the IDF, they're angels. They would never do anything [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3943.8799999999997s)]
*  barbaric. They would never do something as disgusting and barbaric as shooting and killing [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3950.28s)]
*  over 100 Palestinians in Gaza yesterday alone as they were at those humanitarian hubs trying to get [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3956.92s)]
*  flour so they don't die of starvation. You know what that is? That's barbaric. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3963.2400000000002s)]
*  That's barbaric. Yeah, go ahead, call me an anti-Semite when I give you a specific thing [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3967.88s)]
*  that happened just yesterday in Gaza that is barbaric. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3973.88s)]
*  Don't talk to me ever about how this is a war between civilization and barbarism. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3980.28s)]
*  So plenty of barbaric garbage happening right now at the hands of the IDF. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3987.1600000000003s)]
*  That doesn't provide cover for the barbaric stuff that happens at the hands of the Shiite leadership [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3991.4s)]
*  in Iran. But if we're gonna use this case as justification for invading Iran, [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=3999.5600000000004s)]
*  well, the same argument could be made for Israel. So I would be real careful. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4007.56s)]
*  All right, I got worked up. Sorry, I kind of lost my place. Now, luckily, as Cenk [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4015.16s)]
*  shared with you guys on the show yesterday, I don't care. John Fetterman can kick rocks. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4018.92s)]
*  I can't stand the guy. He wants to drone strike them. But luckily, as Cenk shared with you guys [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4024.2799999999997s)]
*  on the show yesterday, the overwhelming majority of American people are not on the side of the [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4028.6s)]
*  hawks. Now, they might agree that it's not good for Iran to have nuclear weapons, but they do [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4034.28s)]
*  not want to engage in war with Iran. So a new economist YouGov poll released yesterday found [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4039.6400000000003s)]
*  that only 16% of Americans back US involvement in the war. That's the most important number, [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4045.1600000000003s)]
*  okay? 60% say the US should not be involved. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4051.8s)]
*  And only 23% of Republicans said we should join the war. 23% of Republicans [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4057.8s)]
*  thank God, okay? Thank God. I don't know if it's gonna sway Trump in any direction. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4065.2400000000002s)]
*  I really hope he listens to his base. But I've grown to be super pessimistic about pretty much [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4073.7200000000003s)]
*  everyone in positions of power in our government. So I hope I'll be pleasantly surprised, but [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4079.96s)]
*  something tells me I won't be. We'll see. All right, we gotta take a break. When we come back, [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4085.32s)]
*  we'll talk about some war crimes. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4089.48s)]
*  What contributions to the progressive cause are you most proud of? [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4099.72s)]
*  I mean, I don't have super high aspirations for a singular role that I can play in the movement or [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4105.400000000001s)]
*  anything. I just I try to present myself as what I think that I am, which is a progressive man who [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4110.2s)]
*  is driven by a, I think, well interrogated and well organized system of values that I try to [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4117.24s)]
*  stay consistent on. And I demonstrate that that's the sort of life that a person can lead. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4124.2s)]
*  And be successful and be happy and all of that. And that should not need to be done, [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4128.36s)]
*  but there are so many people on the right that are trying to push men in the opposite direction that [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4133.5599999999995s)]
*  I wanna be able to do that. Along the way, if I can get people to care about some topics that [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4137.48s)]
*  they wouldn't necessarily care about, or that for some men they might think that's not a topic that [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4141.5599999999995s)]
*  they should be focused on, that's definitely something that I relish doing. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4146.44s)]
*  And along the way, I mean, we've been able to introduce people to a lot of candidates. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4151.48s)]
*  That's been a big part of what we've done. Not all of them necessarily got an office, [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4156.5199999999995s)]
*  probably most of them did not. And a lot of them, you might not even remember their names. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4162.599999999999s)]
*  But it was great to be able to provide people with a platform where they had the chance of [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4167.32s)]
*  making a difference. Obviously, AOC and all that, but there's been a lot of great people along the [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4172.04s)]
*  way. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4176.2s)]
*  The one thing that I hate that politicians do, they talk about the people they should be talking [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4237.08s)]

*  or do they not realize that at all? People are so deeply in their little universe. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4246.92s)]
*  I think it's very easy to not really question what you're doing. Voters have a right to ask [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4252.12s)]
*  questions of any nominee, whether they're independent, Republican, or Democrat. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4257.24s)]
*  The system is lawfully that suppresses competition. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4261.64s)]
*  How is it the year 2024? And we're still like, maybe they'll talk about payback? [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4264.92s)]
*  I know, it's safe. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4269.240000000001s)]
*  Like how is that? Like at one level, it's like, look at what we're talking about. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4269.96s)]
*  And you're like, it's 2024. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4273.320000000001s)]
*  And that's always been the critique that your critique of us is, well, you guys give good [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4275.64s)]
*  speeches, you put out the tweets, but you're not wielding actual power. Now we're starting to. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4279.56s)]
*  Congratulations on all your success. You guys are everywhere. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4284.52s)]
*  It's been a country and a principle, and that's what you and I both worked to achieve. And I'm [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4287.4800000000005s)]
*  so glad for it. At least half the battle has now been won. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4290.84s)]
*  If you want to go really hear what's going on, honestly, you should tune in to the Young Turks. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4293.08s)]
*  Thanks for doing such a great job. Please keep it up. Hang tough. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4297.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4300.68s)]
*  That makes me so happy. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4300.92s)]
*  Oh, I like that you're happy. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4301.96s)]
*  I didn't know about that. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4302.92s)]
*  This is a happy Anikus Berrien. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4303.72s)]
*  You're welcome, YouTube. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4306.04s)]
*  Well, everyone, I got a little worked up in that last segment on a story that we were [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4350.84s)]
*  planning to talk about anyway. So I'm just going to quickly give you an update on that because [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4370.6s)]
*  look, these war crimes, we can't just pretend like they're not happening. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4375.72s)]
*  We can't forget about the Palestinian people who are still dealing with absolute carnage [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4380.4400000000005s)]
*  in Gaza, of course, but also in the occupied West Bank, which is to be annexed, obviously, [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4386.92s)]
*  by the Israeli government. Already there was the announcement of 22 illegal settlements. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4392.76s)]
*  You guys get the point. Now with that in mind, let's give you an update on Gaza. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4398.2s)]
*  The goal of the Israeli government is abundantly clear. The destruction of life in Gaza. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4405.72s)]
*  For a year and a half now, our commission has been investigating the violence in Gaza. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4413.4800000000005s)]
*  We have seen constant escalation and more and more deaths and injuries. In the last three months, [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4419.4800000000005s)]
*  the entire population of Gaza was forcibly transferred into small enclaves and Palestinians [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4426.2s)]
*  were killed while attempting to receive aid, bringing life to its bleakest point to date. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4433.64s)]
*  Now, if you talk to an Israeli, they'll tell you, no, no, no, it's not the IDF. It's Hamas [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4441.0s)]
*  that's shooting at desperate, hungry Palestinians as they're trying to get flour from these [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4447.88s)]
*  humanitarian aid hubs. But you just heard someone from the UN. So the situation in Gaza has never [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4453.160000000001s)]
*  been worse, according to Navi Pillay, who is the chair of the Commission of Inquiry on the [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4460.36s)]
*  Occupied Palestinian Territory at the United Nations. So she's calling the war in Gaza the [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4468.679999999999s)]
*  most ruthless, prolonged, and widespread attack against the Palestinian people since 1948. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4475.4s)]
*  And she laid out the findings of her commission report that were released to the Human Rights [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4482.5199999999995s)]
*  Council last month. Now, I'm gonna quickly pause for further context because [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4488.44s)]
*  if you notice, the Israeli government loves to trash the UN or any UN organization. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4493.879999999999s)]
*  And it's because the UN is an international body that sometimes does investigations into [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4500.04s)]
*  Israel's conduct and they don't like that. They don't like to be held accountable. They hate it. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4505.719999999999s)]
*  Oh my God, you're calling us out on our war crimes? No, we're the civilized ones. We're not [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4510.919999999999s)]
*  the barbarians. No, sometimes you guys act like barbarians. In fact, right now, [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4515.96s)]
*  acting like barbarians. Just keep it real. You don't like the truth, too bad. We're gonna slap [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4520.52s)]
*  you with it. So she starts with how Israel's ongoing assault has impacted children. Let's [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4525.32s)]
*  take a look. Children have paid an unimaginable price. More than 1,300 children have been killed [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4530.36s)]
*  just from the end of the ceasefire on 18th March to date. And more than 15,000 children have been [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4540.12s)]
*  identified as having been killed since October 2023. Our findings show that as Israeli security [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4548.04s)]
*  forces killed thousands of children, they also obliterated the education system in Gaza. More [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4558.2s)]
*  than 90% of schools and university buildings in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed, [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4565.8s)]
*  creating conditions where education for children has been made impossible. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4573.16s)]
*  There are videos of IDF soldiers going into hospitals and literally breaking [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4581.0s)]
*  any equipment that remains. Why would they do that? [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4587.0s)]
*  Was Hamas hiding in the monitors of the gadgets that they need at that hospital? [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4590.92s)]
*  Is that what happened? Come on. Don't insult the intelligence of people who have actually [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4595.96s)]
*  been paying attention to what's happening on the ground there. We all see it. And now you have a [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4602.6s)]
*  UN report to back it up. Notably, while Israeli forces often claim that they were targeting [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4608.12s)]
*  Hamas operatives, allegedly based in schools, the commission verified only one instance [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4613.32s)]
*  of Hamas using a school for military purposes. That is unsurprising to say the least, but they'll [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4619.4s)]
*  still perpetuate that lie. And that's the thing about how Israel is losing this PR war. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4626.28s)]
*  Because number one, I mean, it's difficult to defend the indefensible. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4633.48s)]
*  But number two, they're lazy. They've got three or four talking points and they just [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4637.5599999999995s)]
*  rotate those same talking points over and over again. Human shields, Hamas tunnels, [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4643.4s)]
*  using it as a command center, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4649.16s)]
*  blah, blah. You guys are acting like barbarians and you're carrying out a genocide. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4652.5199999999995s)]
*  That's what's happening. From their findings, they concluded that Israel's targeting of [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4656.12s)]
*  civilian infrastructure and educational facilities is intentional, not accidental. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4659.96s)]
*  And that they are indeed committing a slew of war crimes. Take a look. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4665.5599999999995s)]
*  Israeli airstrikes have targeted educational facilities believed to be safe refuge. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4669.88s)]
*  Areas killing the displaced, including children and women, and deliberately [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4679.72s)]
*  shelled, burned, and demolished schools and universities. The commission could not identify [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4685.16s)]
*  any military necessity which justifies such actions. And we conclude that these actions show [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4692.12s)]
*  an intent to destroy these facilities in order to curtail Palestinians' access to education in the [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4699.72s)]
*  long term. These attacks were part of a widespread and relentless assault against the Palestinian [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4708.6s)]
*  people in which Israeli forces have committed war crimes, including directing attacks against [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4716.84s)]
*  civilians and willful killing and the crime against humanity of extermination. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4724.92s)]
*  In fact, yesterday, Tuesday of this week was such a gruesome day at these humanitarian aid hubs that [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4731.24s)]
*  upward of 100 people were killed by IDF as they're waiting in line to get flour. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4740.36s)]
*  The story was, by the way, awful enough when the reported death toll was in the dozens. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4747.4800000000005s)]
*  And then it got updated and it was over 100 in a single day. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4752.92s)]
*  Absolutely sick. So witnesses said that Israeli forces carried out an airstrike on a nearby home [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4757.64s)]
*  before opening fire toward the crowd. Before I read this, remember a doctor working in the emergency [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4763.24s)]
*  room witnessed seven little bodies show up in that hospital, dead bodies. They were all her children. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4771.08s)]
*  And then later she found out two more of her children died in a single Israeli airstrike. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4778.44s)]
*  She only has one remaining child left. Her husband had survived the airstrike, [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4784.28s)]
*  was hospitalized, but then later died. I mean, just disgusted. It disgusts me. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4790.04s)]
*  It disgusts me. That's really the only way I can express myself and not be overly offensive. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4799.799999999999s)]
*  It disgusts me. This is barbaric. Witnesses said that the Israeli forces carried out an [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4806.2s)]
*  airstrike on a nearby home before opening fire toward the crowd. The Israel Defense Forces said [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4811.48s)]
*  that it was aware of reports of a number of injured individuals from IDF fire following [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4816.84s)]
*  the crowd's approach and that the incident was under review. That's another talking point [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4822.04s)]
*  that you'll hear. Oopsie, we got caught doing what appears to be a war crime or is definitely a war [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4827.08s)]
*  crime. And don't worry, we're gonna investigate it. You're never gonna hear from it again. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4832.68s)]
*  What happened to the IDF soldiers in Janine who were shooting out international ambassadors who [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4836.360000000001s)]
*  were visiting? What happened to them? What happened to that internal review? I mean, [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4842.360000000001s)]
*  their internal reviews are so ridiculous and non-existent that it makes local police [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4848.200000000001s)]
*  departments in this country blush. It's insane. In a statement, the IDF said nothing of value, [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4855.56s)]
*  nothing of value. I haven't even read this yet, but I already know nothing of value. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4863.8s)]
*  But nonetheless, said that a gathering was identified next to an aid distribution truck [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4867.4800000000005s)]
*  that got stuck in the area in proximity to IDF troops. The IDF regrets any harm. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4873.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah, their statements mean nothing to me, nothing, okay? They're terrorists. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4880.120000000001s)]
*  These people are carrying out acts of terror. They are killing innocent people on purpose. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4886.92s)]
*  This is not an accident. This has been going on for far too long. They want to wipe the Palestinians [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4892.76s)]
*  off the face of the earth and whoever remains, get them out of Gaza. We want this land. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4899.8s)]
*  But why would Israel be surrounded by so many enemies? Why? Why wouldn't anyone like, [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4905.16s)]
*  why would people have a problem with Israelis? I don't get it. They've been so kind to people [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4915.0s)]
*  in that region. This is far from the first incident. Israeli troops have repeatedly shot [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4919.8s)]
*  and killed civilians approaching those hubs since they opened last month. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4926.76s)]
*  According to the Gaza Health Ministry, 397 people have been killed seeking aid from the sites, [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4932.200000000001s)]
*  which are located in both southern and central Gaza. And before I hear the ridiculous talking [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4938.12s)]
*  point of like, well, the Palestinian Health Ministry, they're controlled by Hamas. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4943.56s)]
*  Okay, you also have what remains of the few journalists on the ground in Gaza. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4948.92s)]
*  A lot of them actually report to drop site news. Yeah, the casualties at these hubs [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4955.0s)]
*  in the hundreds, it's not made up. It's not made up. One other thing I'll just note. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4962.2s)]
*  Look, I don't know if my speculation here is sound, but I'm gonna say it anyway. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4967.48s)]
*  At the start of this war, at the start of this genocide, there were 2.2 million Palestinians in [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4974.28s)]
*  the Gaza Strip. And if you pay close attention, you'll notice something with how Trump talks [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4980.52s)]
*  about Gaza and how Netanyahu talks about Gaza. They don't say 2.2 million or 2.1 million. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4985.8s)]
*  They say 1.7 million Palestinians. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=4993.4800000000005s)]
*  Are they telling on themselves? Why have they landed at 1.7 million Palestinians? [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5000.040000000001s)]
*  At the start of this genocide, there was 2.2 million. We keep hearing that the [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5007.08s)]
*  Gaza Health Ministry is not to be trusted. They inflate their numbers. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5011.4s)]
*  I don't even know how they count the number of people dead at this point. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5015.48s)]
*  What kind of infrastructure do they have to even be able to do that given the fact that Gaza is [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5022.12s)]
*  leveled? But I think it's an undercount. I think there's a lot more dead Palestinians in Gaza than [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5025.88s)]
*  we know about. And I think there's a possibility that our president might know the real number. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5032.68s)]
*  Netanyahu certainly knows the real number. So who knows? But I'm not believing at all that the [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5038.68s)]
*  actual death toll is around 60,000 Palestinians. I think it's much higher. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5045.64s)]
*  So look, these war crimes, they've been called out by various people and institutions. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5050.92s)]
*  The UN did this report, and I'm glad they did this report, but will it change anything? [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5058.44s)]
*  I don't think it will. And that's the worst part about all of this, [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5064.2s)]
*  that this has been going on as long as it's been going on. Think about all the different stories [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5068.36s)]
*  we covered, including the stories of toddlers showing up at the hospital with gunshot wounds [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5071.88s)]
*  to the head. How do you accidentally shoot dozens of toddlers in the head? [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5079.32s)]
*  How do you? I don't know. And this is the country that has the nuclear weapons, [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5084.84s)]
*  who's trying to push us into going to war with another country that doesn't have nuclear weapons, [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5092.6s)]
*  but they claim will have them very soon. Okay, anyway, we gotta take a break. When we come back, [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5099.56s)]
*  we'll talk a little bit about how the Daily Wire covered someone in the Joint Chiefs of Staff who [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5107.8s)]
*  got fired for anti-Semitic posts, and they thought that this was an own except, [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5113.96s)]
*  oh, wow, look, it was someone in the Joint Chiefs of Staff who was actually worried about war crimes [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5118.92s)]
*  and he got fired for it. So we'll give you that story and more when we come back. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5122.76s)]
*  Okay. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5143.96s)]
*  So let me just note before I read this awesome super chat, because I agree with the spirit of [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5173.64s)]
*  what the super chat is, but we should also note that after 9-11, one of the worst things that our [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5180.92s)]
*  now useless Congress did is they ceded power to the executive branch as it pertains to [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5186.92s)]
*  invading countries going to war. And that was a big mistake. Seeding power to a single branch [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5193.96s)]
*  of government is obviously gonna make Congress as useless as it is right now. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5199.48s)]
*  They'll pass a budget. Usually it'll like us in the butt. They'll raise the debt ceiling. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5206.759999999999s)]
*  There might be some change around the edges if we're lucky, if we're lucky, but overall Congress [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5213.5599999999995s)]
*  useless. Now, when it comes to going to war, obviously you're supposed to have this system [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5218.759999999999s)]
*  of checks and balances to balance out something crazy that the executive branch might wanna do. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5224.2s)]
*  But Land of the Free Home of Myrante says Article 1, Section 8 grants Congress the [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5228.92s)]
*  sole power to declare war. War powers resolution of 1973, passed to check presidential power [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5235.4800000000005s)]
*  after Vietnam. Yeah, a lot of people were mad about that war because we shouldn't have been in [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5243.8s)]
*  it. But okay, Vietnam allows the president to deploy forces in response to threats, [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5249.8s)]
*  but must notify Congress within 48 hours and must withdraw troops after 60 days with a 30-day [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5255.88s)]
*  grace period unless Congress gives approval. Unless the manufactured enemies directly hit us, [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5263.32s)]
*  just saying to stupid Trump. Yeah, I mean, I'm sure some of you might have seen that [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5270.28s)]
*  because of the fact that congressional power in this arena, this specific arena has been [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5276.28s)]
*  seated, deteriorated in Congress. They're now trying to pass a new War Powers Act type bill. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5281.72s)]
*  And it seems like it has bipartisan support, which makes me happy. When I say bipartisan [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5288.280000000001s)]
*  support, I'm talking about Thomas Massie is the one who introduced it. Look, that's the one area [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5293.08s)]
*  where I love Thomas Massie on that, on his unwillingness to just willy nilly go to war. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5298.280000000001s)]
*  So he's part of this effort. We'll see where it goes. But look, I'm tired, I'm cranky, [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5305.16s)]
*  and I'm pessimistic. So I want to say things that give you hope, but today's not the day. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5311.5599999999995s)]
*  All right, not today. All right, by the way, something that should give you hope. Tomorrow [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5315.88s)]
*  is Juneteenth. So TYT is going to be off there in celebration of Juneteenth. I'm hoping that you all [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5321.4s)]
*  get a day off as well and get to enjoy some time with your family and loved ones. But we will be [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5328.28s)]
*  back on Friday. Yeah, we'll be back on Friday. Let me read some more comments. We've got, [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5333.8s)]
*  in Guns We Trust, Trump to Zelensky three months ago, you're gambling with World War Three. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5339.64s)]
*  Remember that? I'll agree with the left on one thing, Trump's a liar. Thank you in Guns We Trust. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5345.400000000001s)]
*  First of all, thank you for the comment overall, but also thank you for proving [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5351.64s)]
*  that not all Trump supporters are in a cult, right? Because I think that a lot of [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5356.52s)]
*  people on the left still think of Trump's base as what it was in the first term. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5361.0s)]
*  It was a little more cultish back then. Now I'm seeing a lot more dissent and that's a good thing. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5365.96s)]
*  Let's get back to the show. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5370.36s)]
*  All right, everyone, just a reminder that today in the bonus episode, I'll be showing [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5391.0s)]
*  some of the clips from CNN. I was on CNN last night on Abby Phillips' show called Newsnight. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5400.92s)]
*  I mean, I want to say that there was a debate, but there wasn't really much of a debate. There [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5407.56s)]
*  was actually more agreement than I expected, but it was a good conversation. So we'll discuss that [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5411.48s)]
*  and we'll show you some clips. tyt.com slash join to become a member. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5416.6s)]
*  DJ Payne says, if these so-called political tough guys want to go to war, why don't they lace up [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5420.360000000001s)]
*  their pink boots and go fight the war? Why sacrifice our young troops for this S show, crap show? [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5427.160000000001s)]
*  It's sickening. Yeah, I agree with you. And actually, my heart breaks [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5434.280000000001s)]
*  for all the young men who just enlisted because they trusted that the Trump administration wasn't [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5438.84s)]
*  going to go to war. It's just so bad. I really hope we don't go to war. I don't think it would [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5446.28s)]
*  be good to have boots on the ground in Iran. And I don't think that regime change is something [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5453.24s)]
*  we should get involved in. Anyway, all right, let's get to our next story. Let's talk a little bit [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5457.16s)]
*  about this employee at the Joint Chiefs of Staff who just got fired for it. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5461.8s)]
*  I'll let you decide. Let me present the story. So [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5468.44s)]
*  a Pentagon official has just been removed from his position in the Joint Chiefs of Staff due to [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5471.08s)]
*  his criticism of Israel and his personal issues with how they're carrying out this war against [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5480.2s)]
*  Gaza. We've talked about all of this stuff. We're about to hear from him in just a second. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5488.92s)]
*  Now, he had posted about this on his personal social media accounts. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5494.2s)]
*  And apparently, it was so offensive that he lost his job over it. So let's talk a little bit about [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5498.36s)]
*  who this guy is. He's Colonel Nathan McCormick. According to a report from the Daily Wire [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5503.64s)]
*  and the Jewish News Syndicate, he was the Levant and Egypt branch chief at the Joint Chiefs of [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5509.48s)]
*  Staff J5 Planning Directorate. I'm not going to pretend like I know what that is. Okay, [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5517.64s)]
*  he was in the Pentagon, all right? That's what he was doing. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5525.400000000001s)]
*  But more importantly, the fact that he was in the Levant and Egypt branch, I think, [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5528.360000000001s)]
*  kind of plays a role in why he ended up getting fired for his, in my opinion, [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5534.68s)]
*  common sense criticism of how Israel is carrying out some of their military action. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5540.200000000001s)]
*  So McCormick, who assumed his position in June 2024, had been very vocal on his opinions [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5545.08s)]
*  on Israel and Netanyahu following the October 7th attack. So here's what he posted on October 11th. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5552.28s)]
*  Okay, I agree that Israel has an absolute right to respond militarily, [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5560.759999999999s)]
*  and that civilians may legally be caught in the crossfire. But you are ignoring the requirement [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5567.96s)]
*  of proportionality. Israel's response is always, always, not hyperbole, [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5575.4s)]
*  disproportionately target Palestinian civilians. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5581.799999999999s)]
*  Where's the lie? Where's the lie? First of all, he says Israel has a right to defend itself. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5588.36s)]
*  It's not like he's one of these people who was celebrating what Hamas did, [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5595.96s)]
*  didn't call them freedom fighters. But given how the IDF has conducted themselves in the past, [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5600.360000000001s)]
*  I immediately had those thoughts. The second I saw the headlines of what Hamas was doing, [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5609.72s)]
*  I'm like, my God, they're gonna go after the civilians. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5615.320000000001s)]
*  It's gonna give Netanyahu the perfect excuse to do what he's been doing for nearly two years now. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5621.4800000000005s)]
*  So he posted that again on October 11th, 2023. Prior to assuming his position, he tweeted other [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5629.96s)]
*  things such as, I've lately been considering whether we might be Israel's proxy and not [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5635.96s)]
*  realized it yet. I've definitely realized it. Our worst ally, we get literally nothing out of the [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5642.52s)]
*  partnership other than the enmity of millions of people in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5650.200000000001s)]
*  I've actually asked this question lately. In a debate I was in just recently, I'm like, [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5657.88s)]
*  okay, I mean, people keep saying Israel is our ally. I can see why we are considered an ally to [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5663.799999999999s)]
*  Israel. We give them $3 billion a year, just flat out, that's the default amount. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5670.04s)]
*  In addition to tens of billions of dollars when they decide they want to carry out a genocide, [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5677.639999999999s)]
*  that kind of stuff. What do we get in return? Oftentimes we hear that it's Intel. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5683.32s)]
*  Okay, what kind of Intel do we get? The kind that claims that a Middle Eastern country that [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5689.24s)]
*  the Israeli government wants to topple is in possession of weapons of mass destruction. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5694.599999999999s)]
*  Is that the kind of Intel we're talking about? Okay, they can keep their Intel to themselves. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5698.36s)]
*  I'm not interested in their Intel at all. The fact of the matter is we don't get much out of [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5703.24s)]
*  that relationship. And the way Israelis talk about Americans, I have to say, discuss me. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5707.48s)]
*  It really does. Their entitlement, the way that they respond to or refer to Americans who do not [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5713.639999999999s)]
*  want to get dragged into a war with Iran, the utter disrespect. Bitch, it's my money. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5721.24s)]
*  I'm gonna say what I want to say. Unfortunately for this guy, though, [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5729.719999999999s)]
*  he ended up getting fired for it. But I want to give you some more of his criticism, [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5733.4s)]
*  because who knows? Maybe he said something that actually was abhorrent. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5737.0s)]
*  Okay, because I don't want Israeli civilians to be harmed, even though I loathe their government. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5740.36s)]
*  I do, I loathe their government. But if he said something disgusting about Israeli civilians or [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5746.6s)]
*  wanted violence acted upon them, obviously I would condemn it and say, you know what, [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5752.6s)]
*  not a good job for you. You should have been fired. So let's keep reading. Let's see what [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5758.84s)]
*  else he posted. The more Israel's death cult escalates towards Hezbollah, [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5761.8s)]
*  the more we will see show of force attacks like this and the 13th of April. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5768.360000000001s)]
*  I mean, again, why is that offensive? Where is the lie? This is someone who's concerned [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5777.24s)]
*  about the blowback of Israel's actions. And the post continued while he held this [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5782.12s)]
*  position at the Pentagon. So here are some of the more recent posts that he had written back in [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5789.88s)]
*  April and May of this year. So look, we can't see the full context of these tweet threads because [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5797.5599999999995s)]
*  the account has since been deleted, but we'll give you what we still have access to. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5804.36s)]
*  So he writes, Steve, the self-delusion in this series of tweets perfectly encapsulates the [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5809.0s)]
*  problem in Israeli society. The Western states go to great lengths to avoid criticism of Israel, [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5815.4s)]
*  much out of Holocaust guilt. But Israel's actions and policies deserve to be assessed critically. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5822.839999999999s)]
*  Wow. Wow. Very offensive. I don't know about you guys. You might be an anti-Semite. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5829.719999999999s)]
*  I'm kidding, obviously. I have more. Supposed democracy, Israel's actions over decades have [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5836.2s)]
*  promoted the accusations of ethnic cleansing and genocide. Israel's self-consciousness [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5843.24s)]
*  can't abide that criticism, just like its government can survive the process of achieving [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5849.96s)]
*  peace and security. And then I'll read you one more. But Netanyahu and his [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5855.88s)]
*  Judeo supremacist cronies are determined to prolong the conflict for their own goals, [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5862.36s)]
*  either to remain in power or to annex the land. Where is the lie? And why is this offensive? [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5867.96s)]
*  This is the kind of person I want working at the Pentagon. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5874.2s)]
*  But he ends up getting fired. So his mistake, it seems, was making it known that he worked at [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5878.92s)]
*  the Pentagon. So despite some attempts to anonymize his account, he did a poor job [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5885.64s)]
*  in anonymizing his account. Let's just keep it real. But anyway, he has repeatedly revealed his [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5891.32s)]
*  name and job title on the platform and has posted photos of himself that match his LinkedIn profile [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5896.92s)]
*  and that include his uniform name tag. Guys, if you post anything online, even if you go to great [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5904.12s)]
*  lengths to make it seem like it's a non-people will find out who you are. There are ways of finding [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5912.04s)]
*  out. There was a Los Angeles Times cover. It was like a photograph of the neighborhood that I love. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5917.64s)]
*  And it was from the 1950s. And these are people from the 1950s. And I'm like, I want to find out [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5927.32s)]
*  who they were. And I found out who they were. I found out their identities. There was nothing [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5933.56s)]
*  to go off of other than this is the general area they lived in. This is the 1950s. Boom, I found it. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5938.4400000000005s)]
*  So it's just be careful with what you post online because you might think that you're doing so [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5945.0s)]
*  anonymously. But if people really want to find out, they can. So the JNS also notes his biggest [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5950.04s)]
*  no-no. So other posts include descriptions of his conversations with generals in the [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5956.92s)]
*  Israeli Defense Forces, briefings from Israel's coordinator for humanitarian aid into Gaza, [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5961.8s)]
*  and aborted plans to send emails over the Pentagon's secret internet protocol router network [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5967.64s)]
*  for sharing classified information. Okay, I don't really care. But if you [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5973.64s)]
*  take a look at those posts specifically, he didn't really share much classified information. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5981.160000000001s)]
*  And I'm not surprised by that either. I don't think anyone had a problem with him because he [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5987.8s)]
*  shared classified information. We know why there was a problem with him. He spoke up about war [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5992.120000000001s)]
*  crimes. He spoke up critically about what Israel was carrying out. You just can't do that. You're [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=5997.88s)]
*  not allowed to do that. You can do that when it comes to how our government here in the United [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6002.92s)]
*  States is carrying out a war. But God forbid, you're ever critical of the IDF or the Israeli [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6007.56s)]
*  government. So he says, a buddy of mine is a general in the IDF. He told me, screw the settlers. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6014.360000000001s)]
*  They can be Jewish Palestinians just like the Arab Israelis. They choose to move there illegally. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6021.080000000001s)]
*  By the way, nice, there's an IDF soldier who says, screw the settlers. The settlers are the worst. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6029.160000000001s)]
*  Okay, these are the people who rioted when they found out that some of the Israeli prison guards [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6036.04s)]
*  who filmed themselves raping Palestinian prisoners might get investigated and punished. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6041.8s)]
*  These are like loathsome, disgusting people. Aside from running Palestinians out of their [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6048.5199999999995s)]
*  legal homes in the West Bank, aside from terrorizing them for decades, aside from the fact they steal [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6055.08s)]
*  homes, build illegal settlements. They also, of course, tried to block humanitarian aid into [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6061.24s)]
*  Gaza when the Israeli government finally relented a little bit. Just loathsome, the settlers. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6067.24s)]
*  But Nate, that was his anonymous moniker, McCormick, wrote also that it is a useful [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6075.16s)]
*  diversion for the media. But I think that if Israel escalates this into an offensive against [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6082.04s)]
*  Lebanon, this is probably when Israel was fighting Hezbollah in Lebanon, they are F'd. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6087.56s)]
*  And we have already told them that repeatedly. I was going to email you on SIPR last week, [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6095.080000000001s)]
*  but I didn't want to email the wrong person. Wow, he sounds reckless, super reckless. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6101.400000000001s)]
*  Now, McCormick's profile did include a disclaimer stating that his posts do not represent the [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6108.92s)]
*  position of the department. What are you doing? Why would you do that? That gives the game away, [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6113.16s)]
*  but it's my opinions, it's not the opinion of the Pentagon. But still, his posts were [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6118.2s)]
*  apparently too much. So one Department of Defense contractor who interacted with McCormick told [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6124.04s)]
*  JNS, that's a publication. This is the kind of bitter oversharing I'd expect from someone who [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6130.28s)]
*  doesn't know better. But at his level, and under his own name and likeness, it's mind-boggling, [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6137.08s)]
*  we have enough OPSEC and public perception problems. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6143.48s)]
*  No, no, guys, the public perception problem with the Pentagon is the fact that you can't pass a [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6148.36s)]
*  single freaking audit. The problem with the Pentagon is that there are no brakes on the [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6154.28s)]
*  car when it comes to aiding and abetting genocide, okay? Just stop. McCormick is like bottom, [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6159.5599999999995s)]
*  bottom, bottom of the list, very bottom of the list when it comes to people who make the Pentagon [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6166.679999999999s)]
*  look bad. So he lost his job, he was fired. Don't criticize Israel, apparently. There will be huge [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6171.08s)]
*  consequences for that. Just absolutely shameful. And he's right. People like to say that Israel is [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6178.84s)]
*  a vassal state of the United States. That is such a laugh. It's the other way around. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6185.96s)]
*  Let's take a break, we'll be right back. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6190.92s)]
*  Well, [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6196.2s)]
*  So beautiful. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6256.2s)]
*  What's up everyone? [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6264.72s)]
*  Welcome back to our social break, our final social break. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6265.72s)]
*  I'm gonna try to read through these as quickly as I can. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6267.44s)]
*  Let's go to, I read that Adam Christman who says he read this in the Trump Bible. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6270.44s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6277.48s)]
*  And look, I've obviously never purchased a Trump Bible. [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6278.679999999999s)]
*  I don't know if it's like literally the same thing as any other Bible, but who knows? [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6282.04s)]
*  Let's go to Elliot who says no, Anna, it's only barbaric if it's not done in a suit and [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6287.12s)]
*  tie, meaning war crimes on the Israeli side. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6293.52s)]
*  Romulus 463 says the Ottoman, Lenin, Hitler and every other tyrant in history. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6297.2s)]
*  Look back in history, fingers removed from Smith's so they couldn't use tools. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6304.24s)]
*  Words always disarm opposition. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6310.24s)]
*  Trump is an authoritarian, but so far not a tyrant. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6312.28s)]
*  I think Romulus is actually on the right. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6317.12s)]
*  So interesting that you're aware of the authoritarian stuff and calling it out and might give you [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6319.84s)]
*  props for that. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6325.639999999999s)]
*  Mohammed Rabini says, respect to Tucker Carlson and Candace Owens. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6326.639999999999s)]
*  Best American journalist and love from Iran. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6333.5199999999995s)]
*  These two good hardworking Americans, Ron Paul for President 2028. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6337.0s)]
*  Are you really in Iran? [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6341.52s)]
*  Please stay safe and I really just, can you tell your people that we don't wanna go to [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6343.36s)]
*  war with you and we're being forced into it because we really don't want it. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6348.56s)]
*  Even a tiny minority of Republican voters want a regime change war, which is the most [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6355.4s)]
*  shocking thing of that poll that we shared earlier. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6362.92s)]
*  Cuz in the Bush years, Republicans, I mean, just foaming at the mouth neocons, both politicians [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6365.719999999999s)]
*  and the base. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6372.5199999999995s)]
*  But things have changed and you know what, let's celebrate that a little bit in terms [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6373.5199999999995s)]
*  of public opinion because that's so different from the early aughts. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6378.08s)]
*  All right, let's go to Darth Hefe who says, good lord, I didn't realize how thoroughly [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6382.719999999999s)]
*  Tucker cooked Ted. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6389.24s)]
*  It was so good to watch. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6390.5599999999995s)]
*  Check it out because there's a lot I couldn't get to and I think you'll enjoy it. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6393.48s)]
*  Stephmont12 says, come on Anna, you know the commandment, thou shall not kill unless it [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6397.48s)]
*  is in the name of Israel and their takeover of the Middle East. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6402.5599999999995s)]
*  Cruz is a POS. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6405.36s)]
*  Agreed on all counts. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6406.96s)]
*  Amberjack09 says, it took like Tucker was, it looks like Tucker was visited by the three [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6408.4s)]
*  ghosts of journalism. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6415.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, look, I love it. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6417.08s)]
*  I hope he keeps doing it. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6420.24s)]
*  I hope he keeps doing it. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6421.44s)]
*  That was fantastic. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6422.44s)]
*  It really was. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6423.44s)]
*  I can't say more about it. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6425.96s)]
*  It was just so good. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6427.4s)]
*  AJ Nestor says, so insane how people want to manifest the apocalypse as if they will see [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6428.4s)]
*  paradise afterward. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6435.24s)]
*  Yeah, they're insane. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6436.44s)]
*  Let's not do the apocalypse. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6438.32s)]
*  Let's try to maintain and improve. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6439.36s)]
*  All right, MetalTurtle571 gifting five TYT subs to TYT's community. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6452.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6466.879999999999s)]
*  Love the support, appreciate the support. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6467.879999999999s)]
*  You guys are the best. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6469.639999999999s)]
*  I'm gonna read a few member comments and then I'll move on to the next story. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6470.639999999999s)]
*  Corey writes in and says, I watched the Tucker and Cruz interview. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6473.36s)]
*  Wow, crazy. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6475.879999999999s)]
*  I could find myself agreeing with Tucker. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6476.879999999999s)]
*  He gave Cruz hell. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6478.96s)]
*  It made him so uncomfortable and I love it. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6481.08s)]
*  Thank you guys for opening my mind and allowing me to be open to having dialogue with the [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6483.6s)]
*  other side. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6488.44s)]
*  I love that. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6489.44s)]
*  I love that. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6490.44s)]
*  By the way, when you have dialogue with the other side, doesn't mean like, I want you [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6491.44s)]
*  to agree with them. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6495.0s)]
*  First of all, even if you disagree with them, at least through dialogue, you understand [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6497.0s)]
*  where they're coming from or what their arguments are instead of just allowing the mainstream [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6501.64s)]
*  or people on your side of the political aisle who have no idea summarize what their, or [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6507.4400000000005s)]
*  mischaracterize what their actual argument is. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6511.280000000001s)]
*  And that made me not as good at my job as I should have been. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6516.08s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6520.6s)]
*  I just kind of went along with mischaracterizations and now I feel like I thoroughly understand [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6521.6s)]
*  people and what their motivations are. [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6527.0s)]
*  And that's important to do to have a better perspective of the world around us. [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6530.12s)]
*  The dark guy says, I hope I'm wrong about this, but I have a horrible feeling Iran is [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6533.84s)]
*  saving something big for when the United States starts bombing them. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6539.16s)]
*  That country is too big to fall apart after only a week of war. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6543.32s)]
*  It's not gonna fall apart after a week of war. [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6547.52s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6549.28s)]
*  I don't know if they have some trick up their sleeve. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6551.2s)]
*  What I do know is that they showed so much restraint on so many different occasions and [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6554.88s)]
*  it didn't matter. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6561.12s)]
*  And that sends a really bad message across the globe, right? [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6562.96s)]
*  So when Israel bombs their embassy in Syria, they were so restrained. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6566.36s)]
*  Can you imagine if Iran bombed an Israeli embassy in some other country, in a sovereign [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6574.6s)]
*  country? [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6581.28s)]
*  You think Israel would be restrained? [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6582.28s)]
*  You think Israel would wait a few days and then hit up Iran and be like, yo Iran, my [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6584.16s)]
*  brothers and sisters, we're gonna do some drone strikes in 72 hours. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6592.4s)]
*  Here's where the drone strikes are gonna be so you can shoot them down. [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6596.52s)]
*  We just wanna show our people that we retaliated so they're not upset with us. [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6599.56s)]
*  Anyway, all right, let's get to our next story. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6603.4s)]
*  We've got a lot more to get to. [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6606.04s)]
*  Hi, Charlie. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6607.92s)]
*  I'm Addie and I'm 14. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6608.92s)]
*  I'm a freshman in high school and I was wondering as someone who has a different opinion on [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6610.88s)]
*  college, what would you say the pros and cons are? [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6616.8s)]
*  Because I'm interested in political journalism and what would your advice be? [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6620.72s)]
*  I think there is an argument to bring back the MRS degree and no seriously. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6625.12s)]
*  I think you're making a really good case to bring back the PIG degree. [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6634.320000000001s)]
*  To that 14 year old girl, I don't know if she'll ever see this. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6640.0s)]
*  If you have intellectual curiosity, if you have a passion, you wanna do political journalism, [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6642.96s)]
*  you go get it girl. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6648.58s)]
*  You go get it. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6649.58s)]
*  Okay, pursue what you're interested in and don't ask Charlie Kirk for advice. [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6650.72s)]
*  You're literally asking the worst person in the country for advice on what you should [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6655.76s)]
*  do with your future as a young woman. [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6660.6s)]
*  Anyway, at Turning Point USA's Conference for Conservative Young Women, where are her [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6664.0s)]
*  parents and why are they doing this to her? [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6669.84s)]
*  Okay, Charlie Kirk told a crowd full of high schoolers, if they're interested in college, [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6672.32s)]
*  they should go get an MRS degree. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6678.64s)]
*  Okay, you just heard an example of it. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6681.76s)]
*  Now, before we hear more from Charlie Kirk, who apparently knows what's best for women, [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6683.68s)]
*  young women, let's just talk a little bit about, look, MRS degree, Mrs. Degree. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6689.2s)]
*  He's basically saying, you're gonna get married, you're gonna be a parent, you're gonna have [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6697.12s)]
*  kids, you don't need to work. [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6701.8s)]
*  He lives in a fantasy land. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6704.24s)]
*  He has a lot of money. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6706.64s)]
*  He doesn't have to worry about his wife needing to work in order to make ends meet. [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6708.56s)]
*  But also, even if they are rich and she doesn't need to work, if she wants to pursue a career, [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6712.72s)]
*  she should be able to do it. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6719.96s)]
*  But Charlie Kirk has been really aggressively pushing this like, ooh, traditional gender [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6722.08s)]
*  norms. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6728.0s)]
*  If you're a woman, you should be in the household, you should be raising your kids. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6729.04s)]
*  Look, if you wanna do that, I really do respect it. [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6731.88s)]
*  And I wish that we had an economy set up in which we didn't need dual income households [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6735.72s)]
*  to make ends meet. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6741.52s)]
*  That's what I wanna get to. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6743.28s)]
*  I desperately wanna get to an economic system that's far better than the trash that we have [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6744.44s)]
*  now, where we don't have these huge disparities in income and wealth among Americans. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6749.48s)]
*  It's really pronounced in places like Los Angeles. [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6757.0s)]
*  So a lot of working class people who live in these big cities, for instance, they don't [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6759.4800000000005s)]
*  have the freaking luxury of being stay-at-home moms, even if they desperately want it. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6763.24s)]
*  But look, I'm expecting Charlie Kirk of all people to get into this kind of conversation. [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6768.04s)]
*  No, he's gonna do like, ooh, I owned you, get an MRS degree. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6772.6s)]
*  There's no depth to this guy. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6779.64s)]
*  All right, so with that in mind, let's go to the next clip. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6780.92s)]
*  Let me also speak to some of the young ladies here in high school, where your top, if you [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6784.96s)]
*  are, who's here where your top priority, your top priority is get married and have kids. [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6788.96s)]
*  Raise your hand. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6792.6s)]
*  Okay, interestingly, I think there is an argument to bring back the MRS degree. [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6793.6s)]
*  And no, seriously, and just be clear, that's why you're going to college, right? [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6800.12s)]
*  Don't lie to yourself. [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6805.4s)]
*  Like don't like, oh, I'm going, I'm studying sociology. [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6806.4s)]
*  No, you're not. [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6808.28s)]
*  We know why you're here. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6809.28s)]
*  And that's okay, actually. [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6810.28s)]
*  And that's a really good reason to go to college, actually, especially an SEC school. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6811.8s)]
*  You will find a husband if you have the intent to find a husband at Ole Miss. [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6818.4400000000005s)]
*  It's just gonna happen, okay? [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6824.24s)]
*  Or wherever. [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6825.92s)]
*  Yeah, there you go, see? [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6826.92s)]
*  Or at University of Alabama. [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6828.66s)]
*  But there you go. [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6830.4400000000005s)]
*  Sometimes rarely, I have expensive tastes. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6834.4800000000005s)]
*  All women do. [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6839.28s)]
*  Depends, it depends on what your thing is. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6840.44s)]
*  I like weird antiques. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6843.0s)]
*  I know, I'm 85 years old. [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6844.48s)]
*  I like cool perfume bottles from the 1920s. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6846.639999999999s)]
*  I collect them. [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6849.24s)]
*  Sometimes they're a little pricey. [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6851.24s)]
*  And you want to know what's really nice? [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6852.759999999999s)]
*  That I don't have to ask my husband for permission or for an allowance. [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6855.24s)]
*  That I have my own economic liberty and independence. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6860.639999999999s)]
*  Now, I'm in a really happy marriage. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6866.04s)]
*  And if there's a big item, super expensive, obviously, we talk and [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6868.12s)]
*  we make sure that we're on the same page. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6872.2s)]
*  But it's just, I have this feeling, I could be wrong, right? [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6874.719999999999s)]
*  This is totally speculation. [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6882.5599999999995s)]
*  I have this feeling that there's an element of control involved here. [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6884.12s)]
*  And it really bothers me. [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6889.08s)]
*  And when you have a young woman, when you have a 14 year old tell you that she's [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6891.8s)]
*  interested in political science or political journalism. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6896.52s)]
*  When your report is, you need an MRS degree, you're not helping. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6900.160000000001s)]
*  And this whole event is just a charade, like a charade, okay? [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6906.68s)]
*  It's useless. [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6911.4800000000005s)]
*  I can't believe parents are taking their kids here. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6912.120000000001s)]
*  But okay, there's more. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6914.76s)]
*  He also wants to bring back the celebration of said degrees. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6916.120000000001s)]
*  Let's watch. [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6920.72s)]
*  If you think about it, I say college is a scam. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6922.4400000000005s)]
*  But if you're going to find your life partner, [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6925.4800000000005s)]
*  that's actually a really good reason to go to college. [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6927.360000000001s)]
*  You have a bunch of people that are single. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6930.96s)]
*  They're at the prime of their, let's just say attractiveness. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6934.56s)]
*  The dating pool is as robust as the other find. [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6938.92s)]
*  And they all live together over a four year period. [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6942.280000000001s)]
*  You don't get much better than that, okay? [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6945.6s)]
*  It doesn't get better after college there. [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6948.08s)]
*  So yeah, you could go learn some stuff. [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6950.56s)]
*  That's fine, I guess, or whatever. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6952.04s)]
*  Just don't listen to your professors. [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6953.360000000001s)]
*  But that actually was the reason why a lot of women went to college in the 70s, [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6954.72s)]
*  80s, and 90s, and it worked. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6959.88s)]
*  Marriage rates have plummeted since then. [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6962.4800000000005s)]
*  Charlie, what would you know about college? [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6966.92s)]
*  What would you know about finding a partner in college? [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6970.84s)]
*  You didn't go to college. [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6973.360000000001s)]
*  Homeboy acts like, yeah, I had a great four years in college and [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6975.76s)]
*  met my wife there. [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6978.56s)]
*  You didn't go to college. [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6980.0s)]
*  So why are you giving advice on finding a partner to marry in college? [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6981.12s)]
*  And no, most people don't go to college because they're looking for a mate. [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6986.36s)]
*  In fact, a lot of people go to college because we live in the type of economy [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6992.2s)]
*  where even to get a low level job, you need a four year degree at this point. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=6995.64s)]
*  And I think we need to change that. [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=7000.2s)]
*  But people go to college because they don't want to live in poverty. [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=7002.88s)]
*  But then they end up taking on a massive amount of student loan debt and [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=7007.0s)]
*  they live in poverty. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=7010.68s)]
*  There's a lot of messed up things happening in this country right now. [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=7012.36s)]
*  And so when you are answering questions from young people who have their whole [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=7015.84s)]
*  future ahead of them and you turn it into a whole joke and [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=7020.48s)]
*  give them this crappy advice, I don't know, I just get offended by it. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=7024.0s)]
*  because I would kill to go back to 14 and know the things that I know today and [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=7028.68s)]
*  do things a little differently. [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=7033.5199999999995s)]
*  But I was very lucky, I had a lot of great adults in my life who were mentors, [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=7035.72s)]
*  who guided me, who gave me good advice. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=7040.92s)]
*  And I ended up with a happy marriage and a career. [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=7044.4800000000005s)]
*  It's not a happy career, we talk about a lot of depressing stuff, but [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=7050.96s)]
*  I love what I do. [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=7054.64s)]
*  And so I just don't want these kids to take anything Charlie Kirk is saying [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=7056.88s)]
*  seriously because again, he's really directing them in a bad direction. [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=7061.04s)]
*  Now while sitting on stage with his wife, he also stated if you're not married by [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=7066.12s)]
*  the age of 30, you only have a 50% chance of getting married. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=7072.08s)]
*  I don't know where he got that number from, people are getting married later and [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=7079.12s)]
*  later in life. [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=7084.4s)]
*  I will say this, if you want to have kids get married sooner rather than later, [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=7085.2s)]
*  because once you hit the mid 30s, you start getting real tired. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=7091.2s)]
*  You don't want to have kids, okay? [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=7095.08s)]
*  You're going to want them to be a little more grown. [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=7097.32s)]
*  But if you've decided maybe kids aren't for me, great, [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=7099.679999999999s)]
*  you can get married a little past 30, you get married at 40, you get married at 50. [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=7103.08s)]
*  People get married and divorced and then married again, what are you doing? [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=7107.16s)]
*  Why are you giving relationship advice? [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=7110.92s)]
*  So he cited the same percentage about having children. [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=7113.48s)]
*  And by the way, the lore behind his wife Erica Kirk is telling, so [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=7117.04s)]
*  Erica is a former Miss Arizona who according to Kyle Spencer's book, [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=7121.48s)]
*  first met Charlie while seeking a job at Turning Point USA. [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=7126.6s)]
*  Wait, are you saying that women can meet someone that they might want to marry [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=7131.6s)]
*  at the workplace? [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=7137.16s)]
*  Interesting, okay. [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=7139.8s)]
*  And apparently, so this is when she was seeking a job at Turning Point USA, [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=7141.68s)]
*  I'm not going to hire you. [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=7144.72s)]
*  He told her when he was done with the interview, I'm going to date you. [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=7146.12s)]
*  Not creepy at all, not creepy at all. [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=7153.76s)]
*  I hope that someone in that family does a little wellness check on that marriage and [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=7158.44s)]
*  everything's okay, but don't take relationship advice. [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=7163.44s)]
*  Don't take career advice from the likes of Charlie Kirk, [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=7167.12s)]
*  especially if you're a young woman. [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=7169.64s)]
*  I don't know what these parents were thinking. [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=7171.5599999999995s)]
*  Charlie Kirk has also helped build the evolving womanosphere. [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=7173.48s)]
*  I'm done with the story, that's it, we're done with it, right? [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=7180.2s)]
*  Bonus episode is going to be lit. [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=7183.24s)]
*  We're going to talk about the CNN appearance I had yesterday, [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=7184.5199999999995s)]
*  what we talked about. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=7187.879999999999s)]
*  We're going to have some fun. [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=7188.839999999999s)]
*  Kate Vitino, our super producer, is going to be joining me. [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyV8jcWwd8A&t=7189.96s)]
