# LEAK: Elon Musk's FRENZIED Drug Use At Trump's Side
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [May 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI)
*  But you've admitted that you have [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=0.0s)]
*  a ketamine prescription. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=2.06s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=3.58s)]
*  What's that for? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=4.74s)]
*  Well, I mean, it's pretty private [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=5.76s)]
*  to ask somebody about [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=7.12s)]
*  a medical prescription. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=8.08s)]
*  But I think it's something I'd say [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=9.34s)]
*  like there are times when I have [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=12.88s)]
*  sort of a negative chemical state [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=15.66s)]
*  in my brain, like depression, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=19.0s)]
*  I guess, or like depression is not [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=22.18s)]
*  linked to the fact that I'm [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=25.46s)]
*  not linked to any negative views. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=29.139999999999997s)]
*  And then ketamine is helpful for [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=32.06s)]
*  getting one out of a negative [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=34.46s)]
*  frame of mind. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=36.86s)]
*  Richest man in the world, tech [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=38.22s)]
*  mogul, business owner, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=40.94s)]
*  government efficiency guru, and [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=42.94s)]
*  father to X amount of kids, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=45.66s)]
*  no pun intended. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=47.66s)]
*  The New York Times has found that [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=49.14s)]
*  Elon Musk drug use is far more [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=51.42s)]
*  extensive than previously thought. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=53.34s)]
*  While Elon has admitted in the past, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=56.32s)]
*  as you just saw in that clip, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=58.339999999999996s)]
*  that he has a prescription for [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=59.86s)]
*  ketamine, he is also said to [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=61.48s)]
*  regularly take several other [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=63.18s)]
*  substances such as ecstasy, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=64.97999999999999s)]
*  magic mushrooms, and Adderall. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=66.97999999999999s)]
*  These allegations come out at [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=69.46s)]
*  a time when Elon Musk's, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=71.17999999999999s)]
*  his public businesses, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=72.6s)]
*  his governmental profile, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=74.08s)]
*  they're all faltering in very real [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=75.78s)]
*  time. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=77.82s)]
*  Today he was in the Oval Office [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=78.74s)]
*  with a black eye, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=80.2s)]
*  who knows what's going on with that? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=81.02s)]
*  But even his businesses are tanking [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=82.58s)]
*  both in revenue and in reputation. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=84.58s)]
*  In 2024, Musk got more deeply and [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=87.46000000000001s)]
*  openly involved in American [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=89.62s)]
*  politics, joining the MAGA [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=91.52000000000001s)]
*  movement, donning the red hat, and [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=93.4s)]
*  donating $275 million to Donald [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=95.78s)]
*  Trump's presidential campaign. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=98.10000000000001s)]
*  So during this time, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=101.42s)]
*  Musk made several public [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=102.78s)]
*  appearances at Trump rallies and [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=104.24000000000001s)]
*  Republican events, and his behavior [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=106.22s)]
*  was becoming increasingly erratic. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=108.46000000000001s)]
*  Perhaps you remember this. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=111.26s)]
*  Come on up here, Elon. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=113.74s)]
*  This rocket company is the only [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=115.53999999999999s)]
*  reason we can now send American [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=117.64s)]
*  astronauts into space. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=119.67999999999999s)]
*  Come here. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=121.52s)]
*  Take over, Elon, yes, take over. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=123.89999999999999s)]
*  Is the only reason we can now send [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=126.02s)]
*  American astronauts into space. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=127.97999999999999s)]
*  Take over, Elon, yes, take over. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=129.9s)]
*  All right, the New York Times [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=137.18s)]
*  states that in a text message [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=138.85999999999999s)]
*  following that event in Butler, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=140.3s)]
*  Pennsylvania, Musk said, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=142.01999999999998s)]
*  I'm feeling more optimistic after [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=143.73999999999998s)]
*  tonight, tomorrow we unleash [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=145.94s)]
*  the anomaly in the matrix. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=147.98s)]
*  This is not something on [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=150.42s)]
*  the chessboard, so [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=151.7s)]
*  they will be quite surprised. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=152.78s)]
*  And then he later added, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=154.66s)]
*  lasers from space, whatever. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=156.26s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=158.01999999999998s)]
*  The Times says with supporting [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=159.57999999999998s)]
*  evidence from texts from Elon, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=161.78s)]
*  that his hard MAGA turns stem from [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=163.94s)]
*  his personal grievances with [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=166.06s)]
*  the Biden administration. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=167.94s)]
*  Musk was facing several [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=170.01999999999998s)]
*  accusations into his businesses and [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=171.5s)]
*  business practices at the time, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=173.29999999999998s)]
*  following allegations that his [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=174.98s)]
*  workplaces were hostile and [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=176.57999999999998s)]
*  the products he was making [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=178.1s)]
*  were safety hazards. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=179.54s)]
*  So, there are at least half a [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=180.98s)]
*  dozen initiatives of significance [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=182.73999999999998s)]
*  to take me down. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=184.94s)]
*  This is what he wrote in a text [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=186.62s)]
*  message to someone close to him [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=188.18s)]
*  last May. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=189.89999999999998s)]
*  The Biden administration views me [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=190.62s)]
*  as the number two threat after [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=192.78s)]
*  Trump. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=194.45999999999998s)]
*  I can't be president, but [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=195.26s)]
*  I can help Trump defeat Biden and [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=196.98s)]
*  I will. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=199.22s)]
*  He publicly endorsed Mr. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=200.42000000000002s)]
*  Trump in July. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=201.86s)]
*  That is exactly what he did, right? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=202.9s)]
*  So apart from spending exorbitant [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=205.26000000000002s)]
*  amounts of time playing video games [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=207.5s)]
*  and tweeting on his own social [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=209.70000000000002s)]
*  media platform, Musk was seen [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=211.5s)]
*  wielding a chainsaw at CPAC and [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=213.42000000000002s)]
*  doing what can only reasonably be [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=215.38s)]
*  described as a Nazi salute more [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=217.54000000000002s)]
*  than once at the Trump inauguration [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=219.58s)]
*  event. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=221.98000000000002s)]
*  He did all of this while insisting [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=223.18s)]
*  that he was too busy to partake in [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=224.94s)]
*  too many substances, which would [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=226.74s)]
*  prevent him from being very [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=228.62s)]
*  productive. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=229.9s)]
*  So from the New York Times, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=230.70000000000002s)]
*  Mr. Musk's drug consumption went [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=232.5s)]
*  well beyond occasional use. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=234.82000000000002s)]
*  He told people he was taking so [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=237.18s)]
*  much ketamine, a powerful [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=239.10000000000002s)]
*  anesthetic, that it was affecting [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=240.82000000000002s)]
*  his bladder, a known effect of [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=243.02s)]
*  chronic use. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=244.9s)]
*  He took ecstasy and [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=245.98000000000002s)]
*  psychedelic mushrooms, and [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=247.06s)]
*  he traveled with a daily medication [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=248.9s)]
*  box that held about 20 pills, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=251.10000000000002s)]

*  Because there are people who can do [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=340.70000000000005s)]
*  that, and whether or not you can [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=343.06s)]
*  we understand it is one thing. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=346.18s)]

*  especially throughout history, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=348.74s)]
*  who have been able to be very [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=350.1s)]

*  wasn't acting a certain way before [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=385.34s)]

*  We weren't as aware of it. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=388.82s)]

*  I think it's absolutely relevant [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=418.38s)]
*  and it's that last part. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=419.94s)]

*  Elon Musk, as a requirement for [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=517.86s)]
*  the billions he gets in federal [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=520.22s)]
*  funding for his various companies, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=522.58s)]
*  has to submit to drug tests. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=525.46s)]
*  I sat down and [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=528.3000000000001s)]
*  interviewed somebody from [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=529.22s)]
*  Rolling Stone today and [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=531.0200000000001s)]
*  they were telling me how what [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=532.5s)]
*  they've gathered is, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=534.34s)]
*  Elon Musk has known in advance when [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=535.82s)]
*  those drug tests were coming. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=538.1800000000001s)]
*  So this reporting from the New York [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=541.0200000000001s)]
*  Times seems to show given what [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=543.7800000000001s)]
*  appears to be a well documented [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=546.18s)]
*  history of at least drug abuse. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=548.74s)]
*  He is somebody who isn't fulfilling [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=551.38s)]
*  the requirements as part of his [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=554.14s)]
*  government contracts and because of [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=556.54s)]
*  his erratic behavior, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=559.26s)]
*  because of the consumption and [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=560.86s)]
*  because of what he's doing, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=563.06s)]
*  mixing those together, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=565.06s)]
*  it is a legitimate concern. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=566.66s)]
*  Why are we giving him so much money? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=568.6999999999999s)]
*  And if there's any solace for [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=570.66s)]
*  his ketamine abuse, that condition [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=572.46s)]
*  that was described in the New York [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=574.78s)]
*  Times piece, some treatment methods [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=577.02s)]
*  require a urologist inserting [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=579.66s)]
*  a metal rod up there. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=582.02s)]
*  So while he has wreaked havoc over [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=583.42s)]
*  our government, at the very least, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=585.62s)]
*  we can cross our fingers on hope, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=588.26s)]
*  he had to endure that as part of [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=590.58s)]
*  his treatment. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=592.58s)]
*  That is- [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=595.1s)]
*  Stand here. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=595.58s)]
*  Very interesting silver lining, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=596.58s)]
*  Jordan, thank you. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=598.1s)]
*  But you're absolutely right. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=599.22s)]
*  He says that there is drug testing [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=600.86s)]
*  at his companies, but he somehow [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=603.14s)]
*  was always given advanced notice of [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=605.34s)]
*  when those drug tests are happening. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=607.66s)]
*  And he's the boss anyway, so [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=609.82s)]
*  even if they came back showing [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=611.82s)]
*  positive for something, who cares? [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=613.78s)]
*  What are they going to do, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=616.4200000000001s)]
*  fire him? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=617.5400000000001s)]
*  I mean, maybe they might at this [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=618.4200000000001s)]
*  point because his companies are [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=619.86s)]
*  doing so badly anyway. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=621.4200000000001s)]
*  But it's true, I like that [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=622.82s)]
*  distinction that you made Jordan [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=624.3000000000001s)]
*  between Elon Musk the man and [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=626.38s)]
*  Elon Musk the everything else that [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=628.22s)]
*  he is, right? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=630.4200000000001s)]
*  This is a man who is relevant not [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=631.26s)]
*  just in this country, but [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=632.82s)]
*  on the world stage in a very, very [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=634.22s)]
*  real and kind of scary, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=636.0600000000001s)]
*  dangerous way. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=637.46s)]
*  The idea that this one man has so [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=638.7s)]
*  much power, he was the one he [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=640.98s)]
*  decided whether or not the [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=643.0200000000001s)]
*  Ukrainians had access to the [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=644.7s)]
*  Internet, things like that, right? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=646.7s)]
*  And this person who is clearly a [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=649.1s)]
*  little bit unstable, and [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=650.9000000000001s)]
*  I'd say that to be nice. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=652.46s)]
*  But he's clearly going through [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=654.6600000000001s)]
*  something, but we still expect him [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=656.5s)]
*  to be able to manage our entire [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=658.62s)]
*  American government and [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=660.3800000000001s)]
*  then also manage overseas war [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=662.1s)]
*  stuff and then also manage his [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=663.9399999999999s)]
*  companies. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=665.9s)]
*  It's asking a lot of anybody. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=668.06s)]
*  So I'm not surprised that he's [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=670.8199999999999s)]
*  having a hard time managing all of [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=672.42s)]
*  it and dealing with all of it and [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=674.14s)]
*  juggling it. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=675.8199999999999s)]
*  And I do have empathy for [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=676.6999999999999s)]
*  that person, which is saying [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=678.22s)]
*  something because I generally don't [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=679.98s)]
*  care about Elon Musk, but I don't [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=682.22s)]
*  want anybody to go through that. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=683.9s)]
*  Also, I do want to just say real [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=685.3s)]
*  quick before we get a break, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=687.02s)]
*  ketamine in and of itself is not [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=688.5799999999999s)]
*  necessarily a bad thing. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=690.6999999999999s)]
*  I know a lot of people who are [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=692.06s)]
*  going through psychological issues, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=693.3399999999999s)]
*  they find a lot of success with it. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=695.26s)]
*  But it's usually, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=697.4599999999999s)]
*  whenever they do it as part of [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=698.78s)]
*  their medical treatment, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=700.5799999999999s)]
*  it is directly under a doctor's [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=702.26s)]
*  supervision. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=704.2199999999999s)]
*  I don't know if that's what's [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=705.74s)]
*  happening with Elon Musk. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=706.98s)]
*  As he said in that interview, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=707.98s)]
*  that is kind of a personal thing, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=709.42s)]
*  the way that he is using it, but [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=711.06s)]
*  he was prescribed it by a doctor. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=712.66s)]
*  So there's that. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=714.6999999999999s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=715.98s)]
*  an angel gets his wings. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=717.74s)]
*  Totally not true, but [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=719.0999999999999s)]
*  it does keep you updated on our [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=720.3s)]
*  live shows. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-hP_zl9BI&t=721.74s)]
