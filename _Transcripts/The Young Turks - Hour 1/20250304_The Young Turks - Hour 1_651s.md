TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

# Trump Begins CRACKDOWN on Free Speech
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [March 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So)
*  I've said this before, I'll say it again. You are the greatest friend Israel has ever had in [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=0.0s)]
*  the White House. That was Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stating the obvious. In fact, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=7.28s)]
*  the United States, especially under the Trump administration, is Israel's best friend because [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  Israel keeps getting cookies from the Trump administration. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=21.52s)]
*  First, it's worth noting that while Doge dismantles the Social Security administration, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=24.88s)]
*  which could lead to the dismantling of Social Security benefits for our elderly citizens, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=30.880000000000003s)]
*  our disabled citizens. The Trump administration just bypassed Congress again to send another [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=36.4s)]
*  $4 billion in military aid to Israel. And that's in addition to a $2 billion weapons package [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=43.04s)]
*  that the Trump administration bypassed Congress to send to Israel within the last month. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=51.76s)]
*  So again, within the last month, $6 billion in military funding and weapons funding to Israel, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=57.92s)]
*  all paid for by the American taxpayers. We've got more, but before I get to that, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=64.8s)]
*  Cenk, I wanna give you an opportunity to weigh in. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=69.84s)]
*  Yeah, was anybody involved in this story on Epstein's list that was already released, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=71.6s)]
*  at least his phone book was released? Yeah, they were, weren't they? Interesting, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=80.72s)]
*  because I'm trying to figure out why the Health and Human Services is talking about Israel. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=88.8s)]
*  Well, let's talk about that, because interestingly enough, Health and Human Services, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=93.19999999999999s)]
*  which is now led by RFK Jr., has an interesting new mission. So I'm gonna read what Secretary [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=98.47999999999999s)]
*  Kennedy had to say about that. Let's go to graphic two here. It says, anti-Semitism, like racism, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=107.03999999999999s)]
*  is a spiritual and moral malady that sickens societies and kills people with lethalities [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=112.39999999999999s)]
*  comparable to history's most deadly plagues. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=120.64s)]
*  In recent years, the censorship and false narratives of woke cancel culture have transformed [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=122.96000000000001s)]
*  our great universities into greenhouses for this deadly and virulent pestilence. Making America [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=130.0s)]
*  healthy means building communities of trust and mutual respect based on speech, freedom, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=139.04s)]
*  and open debate. Which is a fascinating thing to say considering the fact that Trump announced [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=144.88s)]
*  that they will be coming down hard on pro-Palestinian protesters on college campuses. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=150.48s)]
*  Let me read graphic one to you. He says, all federal funding will stop for any college, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=157.04s)]
*  school, or university that allows illegal protests. Agitators will be imprisoned or [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=160.79999999999998s)]
*  permanently sent back to the country from which they came. American students will be [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=167.6s)]
*  permanently expelled or, depending on the crime, arrested. No masks, thank you for your attention [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=172.56s)]
*  to this matter. So, Secretary Kennedy directing the Department of Health and Human Services to [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=179.92s)]
*  combat anti-Semitism is an interesting mission for this government agency. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=187.51999999999998s)]
*  And then on top of that, you have Trump threatening [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=193.51999999999998s)]
*  severe consequences for pro-Palestinian, pro-peace protesters on college campuses. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=196.64s)]
*  Fascinating stance, again, for a guy who seemed to be really upset about [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=202.0s)]
*  left-wing censorship on college campuses. Cenk. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=206.39999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, so what happened to freedom? What happened to freedom of speech? What happened to [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=209.35999999999999s)]
*  free speech absolutists? What happened to cancel culture? Does it get any more cancelled than [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=216.72s)]
*  canceling all of your government contracts because you allowed people to protest Israel? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=221.67999999999998s)]
*  Of course, you should take away their freedom of speech, right? It's not like we live in America. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=227.92s)]
*  It's not like that's what the Republicans have been saying for the last 10 years. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=232.07999999999998s)]
*  But here we are. And by the way, don't worry, you can do any protest of America you like on [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=234.96s)]
*  Columbia's campus, any college campus. You could protest any of our states, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=240.32000000000002s)]
*  you could protest any of our politicians. You're just not allowed to protest [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=244.64000000000001s)]
*  Israel or their government or their politicians. Otherwise, you'll be branded an anti-Semite, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=248.4s)]
*  arrested, expelled, and maybe deported. And if you noticed, Donald Trump said for Americans, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=253.44s)]
*  you could still get arrested and definitely expelled. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=260.56s)]
*  So it's not just for people who are here on a visa to be a student in this country. We're taking [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=264.24s)]
*  away American citizens' rights as well. But look, they're giving away the game because what the [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=270.56s)]
*  hell is this? What does Health and Human Services have anything to do with Israel and anti-Semitism [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=274.48s)]
*  and all that? It doesn't have anything to do with it. It's just, I think this is Israel saying, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=278.64s)]
*  we control everything in your government. There isn't anything we don't control. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=284.0s)]
*  So we will humiliate your Secretary of Health and Human Services and make him fight this issue. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=289.76s)]
*  And it's not, guys, I want you to understand something that's really important here. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=299.84s)]
*  When we talk about the issue, why are we constantly talking about Israel when [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=304.24s)]
*  Bobby Kennedy said, Bobby Kennedy Jr. said anti-Semitism? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=308.24s)]
*  Okay, so let's break that down real quick. Number one, nobody's in favor of anti-Semitism. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=312.71999999999997s)]
*  It's terrible. And if they're saying, yelling obnoxious things to Jewish students, I hate it. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=317.36s)]
*  I have Jewish family that are in college campuses now. I don't want it. Do I want people [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=322.24s)]
*  doing that arrested? No. Do I want them expelled? No, because we live in a free country. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=326.72s)]
*  So yes, they can say things, they can shout things, etc. Even if I don't agree with what they're [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=330.72s)]
*  saying or shouting. But is anti-Semitism the real problem here? No, a lot of the kids that [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=336.0s)]
*  are in the peace protesters, the ones that are gonna get expelled or arrested, are also Jewish. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=340.8s)]
*  That's not what this is about at all. This is about, don't you dare criticize Israel. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=345.52s)]
*  And we know these stupid American college kids, they don't realize that we control this country [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=350.08s)]
*  and you're not allowed to protest Israel. That is 100% what this is about. And if you say, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=357.52s)]
*  wait a minute, wait a minute, Jay, anti-Semitism is a real problem here. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=362.48s)]
*  And it could be a real health issue for people affected. Then why aren't we fighting Islamophobia [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=365.84s)]
*  or transphobia? Or I can list 100 other things. Why are they not health problems? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=371.03999999999996s)]
*  And okay, so are we gonna get into, you know, oppression Olympics? Let's do it. Because [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=376.08s)]
*  is anyone in their right mind going to say in this country that Muslims are treated better than [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=381.76s)]
*  Jewish Americans? No one can say that, right? Muslim Americans are definitely treated worse. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=386.56s)]
*  Every kind of terrible things said about Muslims. Almost all of us are categorized at some point [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=392.15999999999997s)]
*  with why don't you apologize for the terrorism as if we're all terrorists? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=397.36s)]
*  So are we combating that health issue? No, of course not. Because this isn't about Islamophobia [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=400.72s)]
*  or bigotry or racism or anti-Semitism. It's about a foreign government saying we control [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=407.6s)]
*  your government. You're totally occupied. And so look guys- [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=413.52000000000004s)]
*  I mean, is this the- Can you argue that maybe this is the [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=419.36s)]
*  rights version of being woke, right? I mean, think about it. They were furious. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=424.96000000000004s)]
*  And by the way, we were furious too. We disagreed with college protesters preventing conservative [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=431.84000000000003s)]
*  figures from speaking, right? They would get invited by Republican student organizations [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=440.24s)]
*  on campuses. And then Ben Shapiro would show up and there'd be like mass student protests [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=446.0s)]
*  that would prevent him from being able to give a speech. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=450.8s)]
*  And we said that that is wrong. That is not a good thing to do. I don't think that censorship [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=453.2s)]
*  on college campuses is okay, regardless of which ideological position is being censored. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=457.92s)]
*  Now, obviously, you have to make caveats. And the caveat is if someone is engaging in anti-Semitic [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=465.76s)]
*  behavior or making students feel uncomfortable with their actions or behavior, then you can have [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=471.84s)]
*  a conversation about punishment or consequences for the individual who's harassing or doing [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=478.47999999999996s)]
*  something that's unlawful due to their anti-Semitic beliefs. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=483.67999999999995s)]
*  But to just put out a blanket statement and categorize all of these protesters as anti-Semitic [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=488.0s)]
*  because they have the audacity to protest the actions of a foreign government is ridiculous to [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=494.88s)]
*  me. But to your point, Cenk, I mean, it really does show you how much sway and how much influence [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=501.76s)]
*  the Israeli government has over our politicians here in the US. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=508.4s)]
*  So we demand your money and now they've gotten over $300 billion adjusted for inflation over [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=512.08s)]
*  all these years. And we demand you shut up and never criticize us. So this is madness. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=520.24s)]
*  I hated it under Biden. I hated under Trump. Washington's totally occupied territory. Here, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=526.88s)]
*  let me prove it more. So if Bobby Kennedy Jr. came to me and said, hey Cenk, Islamophobia really [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=531.6800000000001s)]
*  running wild in the country. And a lot of people are against Muslims saying terrible things. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=536.64s)]
*  And by the way, some of the Israeli protesters are screaming at Muslim students, right? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=540.4s)]
*  And calling them terrorists, etc. Should we do something about that in health and human [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=545.92s)]
*  services? I'd say, hell no, you shouldn't. That has nothing to do with health. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=549.92s)]
*  And I don't want you policing speech on college campuses at all, no matter which direction it [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=554.0799999999999s)]
*  goes. So and Anna, you said like anti-Semitism is terrible. Of course it's terrible. But there's a [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=559.52s)]
*  line between terrible and actionable, right? So people are allowed to say anything they want [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=564.24s)]
*  against Muslims, against Jews, against Christians, against atheists, against everybody on college [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=570.4s)]
*  campuses. That is the most core American right there is. When you cross the line is when you do [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=575.2s)]
*  something actually illegal. And that is harassing someone, assaulting someone, etc. So if they're [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=581.2800000000001s)]
*  pushing a kid, no, no, no, that's cross the line, that's assault. That's not even close. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=588.96s)]
*  And I don't care what their religion is. That's illegal, right? But that is not what we're talking [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=593.36s)]
*  about here, because that's already in the books. That's already super clear. You don't need extra [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=598.0s)]
*  rules on top of that. They're saying we're gonna take all of the money away from a college campus, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=602.16s)]
*  unless they make sure there's no protests against Israel. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=606.7199999999999s)]
*  And if any of you dare to protest anyway, we're gonna take your freedom away from you, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=609.1999999999999s)]
*  because the Israeli government is unhappy about Americans exercising their rights to freedom of [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=613.68s)]
*  speech. It's an absolute outrage. We shouldn't do this for any country, for any religion. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=619.76s)]
*  This is not American, but hey, maybe America's second. Everybody in this list, can we all be [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=626.64s)]
*  honest? Everybody in this country knows it's Israel first, whether it's Democrats or Republicans. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=634.48s)]
*  So that's just the reality. Everything else is just propaganda. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdKicYt1So&t=640.24s)]
