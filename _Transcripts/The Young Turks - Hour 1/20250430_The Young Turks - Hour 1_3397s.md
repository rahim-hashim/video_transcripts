# Economy SHRINKS In Trump‚Äôs First 100 Days. Trump Admin ABDUCTS 2-YO?! - April 30, 2025
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [April 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0)
*  Welcome to the Young Turks. I'm Jordan Yule filling in for a Cenk Uygur tonight. And my [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=30.0s)]
*  beautiful co-host tonight is none other than Brett Ehrlich. Brett, how are you? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=39.42s)]
*  I'm so glad I got my eyelashes done and that you noticed it and you called me beautiful. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=45.3s)]
*  I'm doing all right. How are you? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=50.1s)]
*  Great. It's always great to be here with you. The certified bad boys of TYT is what people [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=53.3s)]
*  are calling us. More and more people are saying it. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=59.54s)]
*  Many people. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=62.26s)]
*  We embrace the title. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=63.62s)]
*  True. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=65.62s)]
*  Well, Brett, we've got a lot to get into, including some major economic news. So let's [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=66.62s)]
*  just jump right into it. I can't wait to get your thoughts on this. Trump's big, beautiful [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=73.5s)]
*  economy shrunk this quarter. The GDP contracted by 0.3%, the first time it shrank in three [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=80.5s)]
*  years. But immediately, Trump began to shift the blame, writing on Truth Social. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=87.7s)]
*  This is Biden's stock market, not Trump's. I didn't take over until January 20th. Tariffs [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=94.56s)]
*  will soon start kicking in and companies are starting to move into the USA in record numbers. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=100.18s)]
*  Our country will boom, but we have to get rid of the Biden, quote, overhang. This will [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=105.5s)]
*  take a while. Has nothing to do with tariffs, only that he left us with bad numbers. But [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=111.30000000000001s)]
*  when the boom begins, it will be like no other. Be patient. But as we all know, it has a lot [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=117.46000000000001s)]
*  to do with tariffs. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=124.7s)]
*  Growth was dragged down in part by a surge of imports as businesses and consumers raced [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=127.02s)]
*  to stock up before Trump's sweeping tariffs took effect in early April. Imports are a [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=132.02s)]
*  net negative for GDP. Government spending was also down. Now to most rational economists, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=137.4s)]
*  the tariffs and the trade war and the economic uncertainty those created are a direct contributor [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=145.42000000000002s)]
*  to the GDP contraction. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=151.3s)]
*  As a result of the tariffs, prices will increase. But to Trump, that's good because people are [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=153.06s)]
*  buying things that they don't need. Take a look. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=159.28s)]
*  They made a trillion dollars with Biden, a trillion dollars, even a trillion won with [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=163.01999999999998s)]
*  Biden selling this stuff. Much of it we don't need. Somebody said, the shelves are gonna [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=169.38s)]
*  be open. Well, maybe the children will have two dolls instead of $30. And maybe the two [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=174.78s)]
*  dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=180.7s)]
*  But we're not talking about something that we have to go out of our way. They have ships [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=183.34s)]
*  that are loaded up with stuff, much of which, not all of it, but much of which we don't need. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=188.70000000000002s)]
*  Sure, we can just follow Trump's lead. We need to embrace a minimalistic and anti-material [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=193.9s)]
*  lifestyle. I think that's good advice for all of us and who better to lead on that front. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=201.82s)]
*  But Trump's trade advisor, Peter Navarro, went a step further, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=206.86s)]
*  saying that this is actually good news. Take a look. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=210.54000000000002s)]
*  I gotta say just one thing about today's news. That's the best negative print I have ever seen [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=212.94s)]
*  in my life. And the markets need to look beneath the surface of that. We had a 22% [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=221.5s)]
*  increase in domestic investment. That is off the charts when you strip out inventories [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=229.98s)]
*  and the negative effects of the surge in imports because of the tariffs. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=236.3s)]
*  You had 3% growth, so we really like where we're at now. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=241.02s)]
*  Now, as a consequence of Trump's economic policies, the dollar has also plummeted. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=246.62s)]
*  The dollar has fallen nearly 10% in President Trump's first 100 days, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=254.62s)]
*  the steepest drop for a new administration this century. The US dollar index in Trump's [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=258.78s)]
*  first 100 days fell 9.5% compared to a 2.1% drop in the first 100 days of his first term. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=264.14s)]
*  The value of the greenback increased 4.5% in George W. Bush's first 100 days, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=272.06s)]
*  when the country was headed into a recession. It also rose slightly for both Barack Obama and [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=277.41999999999996s)]
*  Joe Biden. But is this spin working? Overall, how do people feel about Trump's handling of [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=283.97999999999996s)]
*  the economy? Well, it slipped to the polling. President Trump's approval rating on the economy [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=290.54s)]
*  is now at its lowest point of either of his White House terms, according to a survey published [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=295.1s)]
*  Wednesday. The Reuters Ipsos poll found Trump's approval on the economy dropped by 1.2% to 36%. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=301.18s)]
*  The lowest figure on the issue in either Trump administration, his disapproval went up by 5.2% [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=309.34000000000003s)]
*  to 56%. So Brett, what do you make of this contracting shrinking economy? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=316.78000000000003s)]
*  Do you think this is a big deal? And do you think that this spin that Trump, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=322.86s)]
*  Peter Navarro and others in their circle are trying to convince people that it's actually good? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=328.38s)]
*  Is this working? Well, so we have too many dolls, Jordan. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=334.3s)]
*  I don't think you just glossed right over that and moved on. We have too many dolls, the kids, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=338.14s)]
*  how kids have too many dolls and they're too cheap, the dolls. Anyone who shops at Christmas [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=343.98s)]
*  time for dolls, which we all do, I'm sure Donald Trump went jingle all the way style into KB toys [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=350.3s)]
*  for Ivanka and didn't have just some person who's raising his kids instead of him, buy them a bunch [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=357.18s)]
*  of toys. It's the dolls, Jordan. It's so ridiculous. Ask to sum up the first 100 days, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=365.02s)]
*  I would just say it didn't have to happen this way, is the answer. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=371.18s)]
*  Donald Trump is a bad businessman. He's not really a businessman at all. Every time he tried to start [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=376.62s)]
*  a business that was not based on just real estate, it failed, tangibly failed. He can't do this, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=381.90000000000003s)]
*  importing, exporting Trump's stakes. It's not good and he doesn't understand tariffs. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=389.98s)]
*  So that's why he's utterly wrong about that first graphic that you sent. Dude, you have a better [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=396.06s)]
*  chance of arguing that you're not affecting the stock market. It wasn't the case that the day [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=401.34000000000003s)]
*  you put all these tariffs on, the stock market ate a fatty. It is your stock market because as [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=408.78000000000003s)]
*  soon as you started doing stuff, it started tanking. And he's been obsessed with tariffs [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=417.34000000000003s)]
*  for a very long time since he was talking to Oprah about them in the 90s. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=425.34s)]
*  But in all of the time he had before becoming president to the second time, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=429.9s)]
*  he never took the time to learn what they are useful for. And I watched much of a rally that [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=436.46s)]
*  he had, like his 100 day rally. And I would love to live in that Trump America that he's talking [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=444.05999999999995s)]
*  about because in it, eggs are free. And the stock market is just a temporary pain. But the fact is, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=449.58s)]
*  all the crazy chaos that he himself started that he then rolled back didn't have to happen. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=456.14s)]
*  None of the first moves that he made triggered a response in any other country that could [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=466.46s)]
*  tangibly motivate some big win moving forward. It was him messing up so spectacularly, then [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=473.9s)]
*  realizing he messed up, then backpedaling on pretty much all of it. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=482.54s)]
*  And now we're in a position where maybe we can make some kinds of deals with other countries [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=487.42s)]
*  on importing. But his fundamental lack of understanding on all of this, and if you find, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=493.98s)]
*  if you do some reading and find out what everyone around Donald Trump and Peter Navarro think of [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=499.82000000000005s)]
*  the guys, it's not that the plan is bad. It's that these guys aren't smart enough to come up [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=505.58s)]
*  with an actual plan. They just yell tariffs and hope that it rains cash. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=512.9399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=518.3s)]
*  No, no, what do you think of all of it? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=519.98s)]
*  Well, I mean, yeah, the biggest takeaway here is that he primarily does not know what he's doing. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=521.34s)]
*  And you can see him get exposed in this trade war. The comments from Trump about his alleged, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=528.86s)]
*  we'll say alleged because it doesn't seem like there was any communication with Xi in China. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=537.1s)]
*  And then Scott Bessent going out saying, well, it's on China to deescalate this trade war. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=541.98s)]
*  You started it. You all started this. And China can recognize that the US does not have a [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=548.62s)]
*  sufficiently robust manufacturing sector that they don't need to do anything. Go ahead, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=554.22s)]
*  make your prices higher in your country and then deal with ramifications. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=558.94s)]
*  What incentive does China have to negotiate with Trump or Bessent or anyone in this administration [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=562.62s)]
*  knowing they need China more than China needs us? And also, there isn't an overnight magical [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=568.0600000000001s)]
*  solution that Trump seems to think there is on manufacturing. All of his tariff language has [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=575.34s)]
*  been about, all these companies are coming back to the United States. It's gonna happen, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=580.14s)]
*  really quick, watch. Then we're gonna be fine. Then these tariffs will be okay. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=584.06s)]
*  That's not, you can't just magically and instantly create a robust manufacturing [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=588.8599999999999s)]
*  sector here. It's going to take time. They're gonna have to build facilities or move facilities [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=595.5799999999999s)]
*  back to the United States. That could be a several year process for some companies. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=599.9s)]
*  So it's just, it's naive, it's short-sighted and ultimately misguided. We're all paying the [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=604.54s)]
*  price for all of this. Yeah, and I feel bad for all the people that [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=609.18s)]
*  work in sectors that would benefit from targeted tariffs and protectionist trade policy that, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=614.4599999999999s)]
*  if handled correctly, could potentially save their industries and bring manufacturing, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=621.5s)]
*  blue collar, actual shower after work, jobs back to America. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=626.9399999999999s)]
*  It's just that Donald Trump is the guy in charge. Who's, in the words of little John in the animated [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=632.78s)]
*  Robin Hood feature from the whatever it was, 40s, who's driving this flying umbrella? [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=641.9s)]
*  That's what the economy, that's what the nation has felt like since he got into office. And it's [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=649.34s)]
*  other people have been protectionists in their trade policy in the past. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=655.74s)]
*  But when done so ham handedly, it does two things. It creates utter chaos now. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=660.78s)]
*  And because of how much chaos it causes now and Trump is never going to change. He's exactly who [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=667.98s)]
*  he was when he first started getting famous in the 80s and got crazy and stayed crazy that whole [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=673.26s)]
*  time. But China is the rising superpower and China literally has a 100 year plan. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=680.46s)]
*  Their initiative is a 100 year vision for steadily growing, creating infrastructure, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=689.5799999999999s)]
*  ways to do business together. And as much as people are, this is my other favorite little fact [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=696.9399999999999s)]
*  is like, these lefties are such godless communists and if we follow them, we'll lose to China. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=702.8599999999999s)]
*  China is the godless communists and they're cleaning your clock right now. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=710.78s)]
*  Because you just don't know how to play this game and everyone else really is looking at all the [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=716.14s)]
*  destabilization done by Donald Trump and saying like, I feel like possibly I'd have a better [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=720.78s)]
*  chance with the people who have sketched out what they're going to do for the next 100 years. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=726.86s)]
*  This is my take. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=732.78s)]
*  Yeah, so one other thing. We saw the spin attempts by Peter Navarro and by Trump. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=734.42s)]
*  And you'll see a large cohort of right wing influencers and media figures try to spin this. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=741.6999999999999s)]
*  They'll just do the same thing and Navarro's doing. Actually, this is really good. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=748.5799999999999s)]
*  And you saw that after what Brett alluded to earlier, the stock market plummeting after [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=752.74s)]
*  Trump started to announce these tariffs. They did the same thing. What really is down in the market? [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=759.4599999999999s)]
*  Like there's some sort of meta question about it. But you can look to the Wall Street Journal [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=764.9s)]
*  editorial board today and they're drawing a straight through line, crystal clear. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=771.2199999999999s)]
*  The economy shrank because of tariffs and a pretty scathing editorial today talking about [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=776.9s)]
*  these numbers, talking about this data and linking it directly to China. And they're [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=782.9799999999999s)]
*  data and linking it directly to Trump's trade policies. Because for them, they don't really [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=787.46s)]
*  care about partisan loyalty. While it is a conservative news outlet and that is certainly [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=792.5s)]
*  a conservative editorial board. They care about the wealthy and for the wealthy, for Wall Street, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=797.14s)]
*  for corporations, for investors, this isn't a robust and healthy market and it's not a safe [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=803.3000000000001s)]
*  place for them to invest. So they're concerned about the wealthy. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=808.6600000000001s)]
*  They don't need to defend Trump's trade policies. And I think that's the best indication of how bad [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=812.66s)]
*  this actually is and how worrying this all actually is. Brett, any final thoughts before [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=820.02s)]
*  we get on to our next story? I don't know. I hope he just figures it out, but he's not going to. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=825.22s)]
*  That's the problem. And it sucks, he just keeps lying to people. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=834.5s)]
*  I, we should be better at the game. We should be better at economy, just to use his framing. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=839.54s)]
*  We should be good at economy. We should be good at jobs. We should be good at making. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=847.38s)]
*  We should be good at leading. But he's not doing really any of that nor has he ever in his life. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=852.02s)]
*  He's just a game show host. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=859.46s)]
*  Let's get into our next story. Take a look at this. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=881.7s)]
*  Over the weekend, and this is suspect, five polls coming out on the same day, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=883.94s)]
*  one of them worse than the one before. These are propaganda polls. That's what they are. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=889.86s)]
*  They're trying to lie to the American people. They're trying to sway public opinion. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=895.7800000000001s)]
*  President Trump has finished his first 100 days with historically low polling numbers. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=903.7s)]
*  And now conservative media is trying to explain away Trump's approval numbers. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=909.1400000000001s)]
*  You just watched Jim McLaughlin and Rob Finnerty do their best on Newsmax. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=913.46s)]
*  Let's watch some more of these right wing takes trying to spin for Trump. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=918.6600000000001s)]
*  He's not in free fall. He's had a little bit of slippage because he's doing a lot. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=924.1s)]
*  He's breaking a lot of eggs to make an omelet. But he is not dropping [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=928.34s)]
*  in any significant way. I can guarantee you. All day, Mitchell, they're going to be [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=932.26s)]
*  bombarding us in the 100th day. Yeah. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=936.58s)]
*  That Trump is the most unpopular president in 100 years. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=939.22s)]
*  What you see this April, it looks like it's gonna be the second highest month of all of Google [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=945.78s)]
*  polling history or Google's data history of searches for Trump approval. So that's how I [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=951.46s)]
*  know it's a Psyop. People are getting these stories shoved down their throats. They're [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=956.98s)]
*  going on Google. They're trying to check it out themselves. The mainstream media is gonna [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=960.82s)]
*  information gatekeep and shove a Quinnipiac poll in their face that says negative 12. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=964.1s)]
*  The problem with the 100 days and looking at the polls is that this format and his agenda is not [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=967.86s)]
*  built for a 100 days. That's right. He's redoing the, in his language, he's redoing the base. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=973.0600000000001s)]
*  He's framing out the house. A lot of it was rotted and now he's replacing it. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=980.5s)]
*  There's not a lot of glory in framing out a house. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=985.22s)]
*  And last night, Trump went even further than what you just saw in that compilation. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=989.94s)]
*  Here's what he had to say about his polling. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=994.4200000000001s)]
*  This is all done in 100 days. But when you watch the fake news, you see fake polls. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=996.18s)]
*  Again, they poll more Democrats and Republican Democrats aren't gonna say, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1003.14s)]
*  I'm gonna vote for Trump. And we still got 45, 44%. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1008.0999999999999s)]
*  But on the legitimate polls, I think we're in the 60s. I really, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1012.5799999999999s)]
*  I think we're in the 60s or 70s or something. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1015.6999999999999s)]
*  Brett, I wanna bring you in here. Trump saying they could be in the 60s or 70s [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1020.74s)]
*  in legitimate polls. But I think if we really evaluate those numbers, he could be as high as [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1024.9s)]
*  a 90, 100, 110% approval rating. Am I wrong? That's a really good point, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1029.6200000000001s)]
*  cuz why stop at 100%? Cuz some people love him double. There might be a Siamese twin [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1033.7800000000002s)]
*  contingent that goes under reported in most polls. There's two Ls in polls. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1040.5800000000002s)]
*  Why should you not get two votes in polls? It's so ridiculous. I love, [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1047.46s)]
*  like, okay, so I like to play out, like plot out the field here. Newsmax, Fox News, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1053.46s)]
*  all right? Those are two different levels of legitimacy. Just ask the people who work for [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1060.58s)]
*  them. All the people on Newsmax really wanna work on Fox News, period, end of story. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1066.74s)]
*  And the people who work at Newsmax and Real America News and all of that stuff, [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1072.1s)]
*  they are clinging on to the last rung on the way down out of the job that they've always wanted [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1077.62s)]
*  to have or in the past have had. And what they do is, we all know this is true, algorithms and [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1084.74s)]
*  right-wing media sphere. They know exactly what they need to do to keep their jobs. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1091.46s)]
*  And their job, they keep it, they just need to say that Donald Trump is always right, has never [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1098.34s)]
*  done wrong. And anyone who contradicts them is a liar and fake news. Now, what's troubling, [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1104.66s)]
*  that one guy say, there's so many people searching for the Donald Trump approval ratings. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1113.0600000000002s)]
*  That means that your viewers probably don't believe you. If you're getting that kind of a bump, [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1119.5400000000002s)]
*  they're like, I'm gonna go search and do my own research myself. And what they'll find [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1127.0600000000002s)]
*  is people don't like his economic policy. They like that he's doing something on immigration. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1131.86s)]
*  They don't like pretty much everything else that he's doing. They don't like what he's doing on [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1139.1399999999999s)]
*  taxes. They don't like what he's doing on the economy. They don't like what he's doing with [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1143.86s)]
*  tariffs. They hate it. Why? Cuz it's bad. And then Brian Kilmeade has a point and doesn't have a [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1148.02s)]
*  point, right? The part of his statement that has a point is Donald Trump does not have a 100 days [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1156.26s)]
*  plan. It's not just that his plan is 100 days. What he has kind of said he's doing would take [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1163.94s)]
*  a long time if you wanted to break things down and build them up. Here's the one catch for what [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1171.3799999999999s)]
*  Brian Kilmeade said. He's undone all the stuff that he did originally because it failed so [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1176.58s)]
*  spectacularly. Everyone out there in the international sphere that we do business with [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1181.78s)]
*  has essentially stood there and watched Donald Trump say, I'm gonna tariff you. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1189.7s)]
*  And they're like, wait, what? This guy's gonna tariff me? That sucks. And he's like, yeah. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1195.78s)]
*  And then all of America and all of the world was like, that's a horrible idea. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1201.22s)]
*  And then Donald Trump was like, psych. And he un-tariffs them. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1205.06s)]
*  That is if your plan is to just totally face plant and get up and pretend nothing happened. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1212.58s)]
*  Why did that need to be step one? Other than he thought it would work so well, but he undid it. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1219.94s)]
*  This is not like a built-in pivot. This is a guy who's trying to save face. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1226.74s)]
*  And the reason that he might pull it off is because of what that we just saw in that montage. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1231.86s)]
*  People from Fox News and Newsmax whose job is to lick around his undercarriage, period. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1237.1399999999999s)]
*  Trump and his fans have also argued that pollsters cannot be trusted when it comes [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1243.4599999999998s)]
*  to his 100-day polling because they have traditionally underestimated his support [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1249.9399999999998s)]
*  in presidential elections. This morning, Harry Edden broke down why the numbers don't support [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1254.74s)]
*  that argument. Let's watch. A lot of Trump advocates, including Trump himself, [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1261.06s)]
*  has argued that because the polls are off in 2024, quote unquote, you can't trust the polls. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1266.82s)]
*  Now, that is a line of BS. That is the scientific term for it is BS. What am I talking about here? [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1271.54s)]
*  Well, let's just talk about Trump's average net approval rating. I averaged across [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1277.06s)]
*  five recent national polls among registered voters. So we're talking voters here, not adults. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1280.34s)]
*  Currently, he's averaging, get this, minus 12 points, way underwater. But okay, let's say the [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1284.34s)]
*  polls are off like they were in 2024. What would his net approval rating be? Well, [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1289.94s)]
*  it's pretty gosh darn similar. It's minus 10 points. He's still way underwater, [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1294.42s)]
*  historically low for a president, only basically matching himself last time around, [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1298.42s)]
*  way below where Joe Biden was, way below where Barack Obama was, way below where George W. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1302.5s)]
*  Bush was at this point in their presidency. And that is because the national polls, although they [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1306.5s)]
*  underestimated Trump in 2024, they only underestimated his margin by about two points. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1310.8200000000002s)]
*  So we give him the two points here, and he's still swimming with the fishes, [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1315.38s)]
*  way underwater, no matter what way you put it, at least if we apply [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1319.14s)]
*  the polls being off like they were in 2024. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1322.66s)]
*  Now, Brett, before I bring you back in here, I wanna go over one more poll that PBS released [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1325.22s)]
*  yesterday. 45% of US adults rated Trump's return to the overall Oval Office an F, [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1331.6200000000001s)]
*  including 80% of Democrats and 49% of independents. At the other extreme, [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1338.6599999999999s)]
*  23% of Americans, including 54% of Republicans, gave the president an A. About half of US adults [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1345.3799999999999s)]
*  say Trump's second term has had a mostly negative effect on their lives, and a majority believe he [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1353.3799999999999s)]
*  is rushing to make changes without considering the effects of his actions. Rushing to make changes [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1360.02s)]
*  without considering the effects, Brett, that doesn't sound like Donald Trump. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1366.18s)]
*  This is so difficult, right? Because obviously that's what he's doing. But there is this thing [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1369.0600000000002s)]
*  about America where after, the way I would describe it is we want someone to do something, [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1374.42s)]
*  but we also don't want anyone to do anything. This people in there right now, [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1382.5800000000002s)]
*  it's just a general dynamic. The bums we got in Washington, they don't do anything. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1389.38s)]
*  And we need someone who's an outsider coming and do something. And no matter who it is, [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1395.46s)]
*  the new regime comes in. And as soon as they start doing anything, and often before they do anything, [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1400.58s)]
*  people are like, these guys are bums too. So there's always that, and that presents itself [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1407.46s)]
*  in such ways as if the incoming party, if the incoming president has a majority in Congress, [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1412.58s)]
*  odds are by the end of the second year, when they have the midterm elections, they'll lose seats. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1421.86s)]
*  That's just how it happens, cuz it's easier to run against someone who's in office. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1427.6999999999998s)]
*  When they just give you more, like throw this person out in a swing district basically. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1434.26s)]
*  That's just kind of how it ends up working. But the difficult part for me is, [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1439.6999999999998s)]
*  like when you're fighting against it in the Internet's like we are right now, [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1445.94s)]
*  there's people that might just luck into a position where it seems like they were right, [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1453.22s)]
*  even though they didn't do anything. In the wake of Trump's win, you go in there, [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1459.94s)]
*  you're like, I just wanna find out what people that support Trump were thinking. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1464.98s)]
*  And there's always gonna be a down slide. And there's people on the other side who are like, [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1470.18s)]
*  Trump was an idiot this whole time and he's evil and sucks. And those people, [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1474.5s)]
*  they didn't get through to anybody, but they're right that Trump is getting punched in the face. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1481.22s)]
*  And I'm trying to figure out why people would still hang around with Trump and read the tea [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1484.74s)]
*  leaves on this. But in the meantime, he is absolutely screwing himself over by making [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1488.98s)]
*  such horrible decisions. I know that was a lot, I hope it made sense. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1493.62s)]
*  It did, it all made sense. But what doesn't make sense is Trump's insistence that Kilmar [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1497.3799999999999s)]
*  Abrego-Garcia's finger tattoos are real. So we were going to talk about that after the break, [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1502.02s)]
*  stick around, you won't wanna miss it. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1508.74s)]
*  Welcome back to The Young Turks, I'm Jordan Yule joined by the gorgeous [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1526.82s)]
*  Brett Erlich. Let's get into our next story, it's a doozy, take a look at this. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1535.78s)]
*  Let me ask you about one man in one court order, Kilmar Abrego-Garcia. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1539.9399999999998s)]
*  You'll pick out one man, but even the man that you picked out, he said he wasn't a member of a gang. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1544.26s)]
*  And then they looked and on his knuckles, he had MS-13. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1550.4199999999998s)]
*  There's a dispute over that. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1554.42s)]
*  Well, wait a minute, wait a minute, he had MS-13 on his knuckles tattoo. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1554.98s)]
*  He had some tattoos that are interpreted that way, but let's move on. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1559.7s)]
*  Wait a minute, hey Terry, Terry, Terry. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1562.5s)]
*  He did not have the letter MS-13. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1564.9s)]
*  It says MS-13. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1567.14s)]
*  That was Photoshopped. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1568.82s)]
*  During an interview with ABC's Terry Moran last night, Donald Trump repeatedly insisted [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1572.98s)]
*  that wrongfully deported Kilmar Abrego-Garcia literally had MS-13 tattooed on his fingers. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1578.1s)]
*  We're going to show you more of him doubling and even tripling down during that exchange. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1584.98s)]
*  But for context, he was referring to a very clearly digitally altered [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1589.2199999999998s)]
*  photograph of Abrego-Garcia's hand. He posted this photo to his social media accounts weeks ago. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1595.2199999999998s)]
*  You can see that someone has Photoshopped MS-13 above the man's actual tattoos of marijuana, [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1601.62s)]
*  a smiley face, a cross, and a skull. Whether his real tattoos have any significance or ties to MS-13 [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1611.1399999999999s)]
*  has been debated. But what's not debated is the photo that Trump posted was Photoshopped. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1620.1s)]
*  At least it wasn't debated by anybody until last night when Trump went on ABC and made that case. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1626.34s)]
*  Take a look. It says MS-13. That was Photoshopped. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1632.58s)]
*  So let me just- That was Photoshopped. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1637.78s)]
*  Terry, you can't do that. Hey, they're giving you the big break of a lifetime. You're doing [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1639.1399999999999s)]
*  the interview. I picked you because frankly I never heard of you, but that's okay. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1643.3799999999999s)]
*  I picked you, Terry, but you're not being very nice. He had MS-13 tattooed- [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1646.98s)]
*  We'll agree to disagree. I want to move on to something else. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1652.4199999999998s)]
*  Terry, do you want me to show you the picture? [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1654.26s)]
*  I saw the picture. We'll agree to disagree. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1657.46s)]
*  And you think it was Photoshopped? Well, here we go. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1659.14s)]
*  Here we go. Don't Photoshop it. Go look at his hand. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1661.06s)]
*  He had MS-13. He did have tattoos that can be interpreted that way. I'm not an expert on them. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1663.06s)]
*  I want to turn to Ukraine. Okay, we're turning to Ukraine. Let's see. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1667.06s)]
*  Terry, no, no. No, no. He had MS as clear as you can be, not interpreted. This is why [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1674.58s)]
*  people no longer believe the news because it's fake news. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1681.86s)]
*  When he was photographed in El Salvador, they aren't there. But let's just go. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1684.74s)]
*  They aren't there when he's in El Salvador. They weren't there, but they're there now, right? [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1689.6999999999998s)]
*  No, but they're there now. They're in your picture. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1693.62s)]
*  Terry. Ukraine, sir. He's got MS-13 on his knuckles. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1695.1399999999999s)]
*  All right. Okay? We'll take a look. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1698.82s)]
*  It's such a disservice. We'll take a look at that, sir. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1701.3s)]
*  Why don't you just say yes, he does, and go on to something else? [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1703.6999999999998s)]
*  He's contested. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1707.6999999999998s)]
*  But it's a good way to wrap up that conversation, but it's not really contested. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1708.34s)]
*  Photos of Kilmarn with his family as well as photos taken in El Salvador with Senator Chris [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1714.82s)]
*  Van Hollen show there is no MS-13 on his fingers. Brett, oh my God. It's just like, it's a train wreck. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1719.3799999999999s)]
*  You just want it to end. I don't even like the guy, but I want it to end on his behalf. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1729.06s)]
*  President of United States. I looked at that photo and was like, why would this guy get a [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1733.6200000000001s)]
*  beautiful skull tattoo and a really cool smiley face and the most photorealistic marijuana leaf [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1743.8600000000001s)]
*  on his knuckles possible and then go get the Chahoma Standard Sans Serif font MS-13 over top of it. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1752.58s)]
*  Look at anyone else with MS-13 tattoos in the thoroughly terrifying videos that they play. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1765.22s)]
*  Not because these guys are terrifying, although I'm sure many of them are. But Trump at his rally [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1772.6599999999999s)]
*  the other day played this video that where they were all just getting dog walked and [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1780.42s)]
*  shaving and the MS-13 is huge. Not a lot of code going on if you're an MS-13. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1784.1000000000001s)]
*  You put like whatever Salvatrucha, you break the whole thing on your entire body. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1790.8200000000002s)]
*  Donald Trump is like this thing that he posted which was photoshopped. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1799.0600000000002s)]
*  He thinks it's real, but of course he would. This is a guy who looks at an actual photo of [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1805.78s)]
*  a crowd size and sees that his is smaller than Barack Obama's but then goes nope, [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1811.78s)]
*  there's more people in this photo with fewer people in it. This is a guy who was wrong about [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1817.46s)]
*  the path of a hurricane and pulled out a sharpie to draw a fake path of a hurricane and clings to [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1824.18s)]
*  it to this day. He's so delusional and that's where it's like, how can anyone trust this guy? [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1832.98s)]
*  Even his defenders will look you dead in the eye and essentially tell you, listen, he's just lying. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1842.74s)]
*  Don't hate him. You should support him more because he's just lying. Terry gave him an out, [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1850.34s)]
*  Jordan. Terry was like, let me do you a favor, sir. Let's move on to Ukraine, [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1857.7s)]
*  which you theoretically were supposed to fix 99 days ago. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1864.42s)]
*  But he still was like, let's talk about this. I wonder what's happening [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1870.1000000000001s)]
*  right now in the White House in the wake of this. Whose head is he tearing off? What was your take? [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1873.54s)]
*  I mean, it's incredible. I didn't even think it was real. It was so embarrassing. There's nobody [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1879.7s)]
*  in his circle. Nobody took the time to explain to him, no, Mr. President, those aren't real. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1887.78s)]
*  That's just showing you what is alleged about those tattoos and their meaning. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1894.02s)]
*  And he sees labels and he's like, wow, this guy, he's just basically he's proclaiming it. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1900.58s)]
*  He's leaning into it. And the conviction in his comments, like, no, you're doing such a [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1906.26s)]
*  disservice. Admit it, good Lord. He doesn't even, after multiple attempts of this guy trying, [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1913.3799999999999s)]
*  like you're saying, give him an out. He still doesn't pick up on it. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1918.82s)]
*  And look, you saw at the Correspondence Center this weekend, Alex Thompson. This isn't a criticism [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1922.74s)]
*  about Alex Thompson at Politico or Axios, wherever he is now. Talking about how, look, [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1930.18s)]
*  the media dropped the ball on Biden and his cognitive decline. They dropped the ball on [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1935.38s)]
*  that story. And people are pointing out, hey, if you want to make sure you don't do that again, [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1940.5s)]
*  now's your chance. And this is the perfect example of a type of incident that should [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1946.5s)]
*  raise red flags about somebody's cognitive ability. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1953.38s)]
*  Because for all of us, everyone watching this, even people on the right, they knew that that [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1956.8200000000002s)]
*  was just Photoshopped so people could go in there. So they could show, well, this tattoo [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1962.74s)]
*  stands for the M, this tattoo stands for the S. And it seems like the only person who thought [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1967.78s)]
*  that those were tattoos was Donald Trump. He's not well. I don't think this is delving into hysterics [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1973.38s)]
*  or some sort of Trump derangement syndrome, whatever they want to call it on the right. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1980.66s)]
*  Nobody should be, nobody in their right mind sees that and thinks that is a real tattoo. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1987.22s)]
*  It's deeply troubling and fully alarming. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1992.02s)]
*  I don't think he's in cognitive decline. I think he's an idiot. He's stupid. That is stupid. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=1995.1399999999999s)]
*  And even if you see, I saw that thing and I was like, I guess it says MS-13. Let me look. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2003.6999999999998s)]
*  I don't trust Trump because he lies. At his 100 day rally, he said like five, [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2008.34s)]
*  he basically said eggs were free and like he won Michigan like all three times he ran. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2013.3799999999999s)]
*  He literally says that to this day. He's a liar and he lies to serve his own purposes. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2019.86s)]
*  I saw that first photo when he had that, when it said MS-13 on his knuckles and I did what [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2026.58s)]
*  everyone else did. I went and was like, are there any other photos of this guy? Because that looks [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2032.34s)]
*  real weird. It looks so weird that like the M is not warped with his skin and the contours of [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2036.82s)]
*  his skin and how come it's not centered with the rest of it? Let me go find other photos and there [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2044.6599999999999s)]
*  are other photos of him without that stuff going on. And you don't even have to listen to me. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2049.46s)]
*  Because if you listen to the Supreme Court, they said whether that's true or not. And for me, [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2059.14s)]
*  it's like the guy might be in MS-13. I don't know. But what I do know is that the [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2064.42s)]
*  Supreme Court of the United States, one third of which was appointed by Donald Trump and has no [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2068.82s)]
*  reason and has gone along with it and no reason to contradict him for any personal vendetta. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2075.3s)]
*  And has gone along with him on some pretty horrible stuff. They nine to nothing were like, [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2079.94s)]
*  yeah, you gotta bring that guy back. Yeah. Well, but Terry Moran. Yeah. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2086.66s)]
*  Terry Moran also pressed Donald Trump on the issue of due process when it comes to deportations. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2092.74s)]
*  And Trump's answer made it clear. He really couldn't care less about it. Take a look. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2097.14s)]
*  Do you acknowledge that under our law, every single person who gets deported, [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2101.3s)]
*  gets a hearing first to make their case? Well, are we talking about people that are citizens [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2109.14s)]
*  of our country or not? No, you're not deporting citizens at this point. Well, let me ask you, [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2114.1s)]
*  did they get hearings when Biden allowed 21 million, cuz I think the number is 20 million [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2118.26s)]
*  people to flow into our country. They came from all over the world. They came from the Congo. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2124.82s)]
*  They came from South. The law requires that every single person who is going to be deported gets a [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2129.3s)]
*  hearing first. Well, I'll have to ask the lawyers about that. If people come into our country [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2135.46s)]
*  illegally, there's a different standard. These are illegal. They came in illegally. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2141.78s)]
*  But they get due process. Well, they get a process where we have to get them out. Yeah. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2146.18s)]
*  Brett, does Donald Trump know what due process is? [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2154.74s)]
*  No, I was on Dr. Phil's channel yesterday because one of their shows is during this one. So I'm the [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2158.58s)]
*  only one who's available to do it. And they had a guy who's a Newsweek editor at large. And his [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2165.8599999999997s)]
*  entire approach to this is due process is just something people made up recently. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2170.8999999999996s)]
*  And we really do need to rely, his friend was like, we need to rely on the Congress of the [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2176.8199999999997s)]
*  United States to help Donald Trump out here in a situation where the judiciary has lost its mind. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2182.1s)]
*  And has gotten a little uppity, essentially, which is crazy, cuz those are co-equal branches. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2190.3399999999997s)]
*  And they will do everything possible. They will use a lot of words very fast and try to shame you [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2195.14s)]
*  into thinking that you don't know what, you don't even need to know because the Supreme Court [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2200.74s)]
*  told them that they need to bring this guy back because the Constitution protects us, [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2206.2599999999998s)]
*  in protecting them, it protects us. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2212.8999999999996s)]
*  Because all you're saying is, there's very few people in America who are like, [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2216.5s)]
*  if someone comes in illegally, let them kill my family and take my job, take my job, please, [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2223.06s)]
*  God, take my job. No one's like that, right? And so what we want is a system where people like [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2229.3s)]
*  laws, it's fine, we'll follow them. A system that makes sure that the person you're sending [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2236.02s)]
*  to a Salvadoran prison is actually in MS-13 or has actually done things that would, by the law, [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2240.42s)]
*  mandate that they get remanded to that custody. Especially at a time when there's a video, [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2248.7400000000002s)]
*  the President of the United States sitting with the President of El Salvador and saying, hey, [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2255.3s)]
*  maybe you should build five more prisons so we can send the homegrown ones there. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2260.1000000000004s)]
*  Implying he has a plan to send people who are American citizens to El Salvador. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2266.6600000000003s)]
*  Now he lies about a lot of stuff, but he also has done some crazy stuff that has lost retirees much [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2274.5800000000004s)]
*  of their 401K, and he is setting his sights on Social Security. There are horrible things that [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2281.06s)]
*  he has done, will do, as overturn Roe versus Wade. So I don't like being called unhinged [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2286.2599999999998s)]
*  and Trump deranged when I'm just playing it the way I have to play it, because this guy actually [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2293.54s)]
*  does, believe it or not, some of the stuff that he says. Yeah, it's a mess. And just one more [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2298.98s)]
*  thing on those tattoos, it's just for the Photoshop. It's really remarkable that he is so [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2306.82s)]
*  susceptible to believing something like that, and it makes you wonder what else he might fall for. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2314.5s)]
*  And when you're in a position like that, that's really dangerous. So if there are any Nigerian [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2321.38s)]
*  princes out there, here's your guy, go, go get him. We'll be back after this. We've got a good news [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2326.7400000000002s)]
*  story out of Columbia University. You won't want to miss it. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2335.22s)]
*  Up here and it's called Memory. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2338.66s)]
*  Everything's computer. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2353.54s)]
*  All right, welcome back to The Young Turks. I'm Jordan Yule with the stunning [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2359.9399999999996s)]
*  Brett Ehrlich by my side. We've got some great news from Columbia University. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2363.7s)]
*  Let's get into it. Take a look at this. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2368.4199999999996s)]
*  I've always learned that home is where you feel safe and loved. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2380.98s)]
*  And those who surround you there are your people and you are my people. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2385.8599999999997s)]
*  For once, we actually have a good update. This morning, a judge ordered the release of Columbia [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2394.66s)]
*  University student motion Madhawi after he was detained by ICE agents earlier this month for his [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2399.7799999999997s)]
*  involvement in pro-Palestinian protests. On April 14th, Madhawi, a legal resident and [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2405.9399999999996s)]
*  green card holder, was arrested by immigration officials during a scheduled appearance at an [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2411.7s)]
*  immigration office in Vermont for a naturalization interview. Secretary of State Marco Rubio [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2416.58s)]
*  justified his detention saying his presence and activities in the United States would have serious [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2423.7799999999997s)]
*  adverse foreign policy consequences and would compromise a compelling US foreign policy interest, [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2428.74s)]
*  according to the DHS notice for Madhawi to appear. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2436.1s)]
*  In the government's opposition to releasing Madhawi, it's said that law enforcement records [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2440.18s)]
*  indicated that Madhawi has admitted to being involved in and supporting anti-Semitic acts [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2446.1s)]
*  of violence and an interest in and facility with firearms for that purpose, according to [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2453.7s)]
*  court documents reviewed by NBC News. Madhawi helped lead the pro-Palestinian movement at [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2461.7799999999997s)]
*  Columbia until last spring, which is when he shifted gears and started to focus on building [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2468.98s)]
*  bridges with Jewish and Israeli communities at the university. He's passionately spoken out against [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2474.2599999999998s)]
*  anti-Semitism in the past. During an interview with 60 Minutes, he recalled that during a walkout [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2480.58s)]
*  on November 9th, one person was yelling death to Jews, and this is how he responded. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2486.66s)]
*  I was shocked, and I walked directly to that person and I told him, [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2492.8199999999997s)]
*  you don't represent us because this is not something that we agree with. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2496.98s)]
*  And I took the megaphone and I gave a speech and I said, we here are conscious, educated students [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2500.9s)]
*  and we know how to separate right from wrong. What this guy has said is clearly anti-Semitic [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2508.74s)]
*  against Jews. To be anti-Semitic is unjust, and the fight for the freedom of Palestine and the [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2515.54s)]
*  fight against anti-Semitism go hand in hand because injustice anywhere is a threat to justice [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2522.1s)]
*  everywhere. But the Trump administration is still claiming he's anti-Semitic. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2529.14s)]
*  The government included two exhibits with their filing, which have been filed under seal. One of [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2534.18s)]
*  the exhibits which NBC News has reviewed is a 2015 report from the Windsor Police Department in [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2539.7s)]
*  Vermont, where a gun shop owner told officers that Madawi supposedly told the owner that he [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2546.4199999999996s)]
*  used to build machine guns to kill Jews while he was in Palestine. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2553.7799999999997s)]
*  Madawi recalled visiting the gun shop, but stated in his declaration, [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2558.42s)]
*  I am absolutely certain that I never expressed the words the report falsely attributes to me [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2562.98s)]
*  in that exchange or ever. I am a peaceful person and would never express wanting to [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2570.02s)]
*  harm or kill anyone. I am heartbroken to have such appalling words which stand in complete [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2575.78s)]
*  contrast to my philosophy on life and spiritual beliefs misattributed to me. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2582.26s)]
*  And the judge thankfully saw that. In his ruling, Judge Joffrey Crawford cited his extensive ties [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2588.34s)]
*  to the community. He noted that the court had received more than 90 submissions from community [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2596.7400000000002s)]
*  members, academic experts, and professors who know Mr. Madawi, many of them Jewish, [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2602.1800000000003s)]
*  attesting to his character and consistently describing him as peaceful. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2608.74s)]
*  Judge Crawford found Madawi did not pose a danger to the public and was not a flight risk, [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2614.2599999999998s)]
*  so he was released on bail. Now, this isn't the end of the fight as the immigration case against [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2619.7799999999997s)]
*  him will continue, but Madawi can fight it from outside the detention center. He is also allowed [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2625.22s)]
*  to attend Columbia's graduation next month. Following his release, Madawi sent a message [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2631.7799999999997s)]
*  to the Trump administration from outside the courthouse. I'm saying it clear and loud to [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2637.06s)]
*  President Trump and his cabinet. I am not afraid of you. What we are witnessing now [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2642.18s)]
*  and what we're understanding is exactly what Dr. Martin Luther King has said before. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2647.22s)]
*  Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. Keep in mind that yes, you might [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2651.46s)]
*  think I am free, but my freedom is interlinked to the freedom of many other students, including [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2657.06s)]
*  Rameza, Oz Turk, and Mahmoud Khalil. We must stand up for humanity because the rest of the world, [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2664.02s)]
*  not only Palestine, is watching us. And what is going to happen in America is going to affect [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2671.38s)]
*  the rest of the world. So Brett, what do you make of his release and I guess some of these claims [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2676.9s)]
*  that the government is making? Can we believe Rubio and the State Department on some of these claims? [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2684.18s)]
*  Well, regardless of whether you can believe Rubio or not, there is a massive contingent of [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2690.42s)]
*  Trump acceptors, if not supporters, who are abandoning him over this issue, period. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2697.14s)]
*  There was this one amazing moment. I forget what it was specifically, but Joe Rogan and that crew [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2704.98s)]
*  are looking at this and being like, that's weird. I thought we were all vaguely libertarian, [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2712.26s)]
*  free speech absolutist here and you're arresting someone who protested, but in a way that's way [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2717.7s)]
*  over the top and the video doesn't look good. And the folks that are just kind of casually [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2723.7799999999997s)]
*  observing this are like, why would you do that? I thought the best ideas won. The counter argument [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2730.66s)]
*  that they make from the Trump side that I've seen that's pretty hilarious is like, let's say that [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2738.98s)]
*  there was someone here who's a legal resident green card holder and they started saying stuff [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2744.98s)]
*  like black lives don't matter and we should kill all black people. The answer is, well, [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2750.7400000000002s)]
*  it's still a free speech thing. Some of my favorite people to listen to are neo-Nazis [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2760.1s)]
*  because they're hilarious and they're horrible. And I think if they do something bad that's [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2765.38s)]
*  actually legally actionable, we should act on that. But if they're just being stupid in public, [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2770.34s)]
*  let them speak, they'll give you enough rope to hang themselves with. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2777.2200000000003s)]
*  And then also generally with protests, the smartest thing to do if you're the powerful [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2782.9s)]
*  group is to let them do it. Because protesters are loud and it's in the middle of a plaza [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2787.86s)]
*  and everybody kind of hates that because they got to walk through the plaza. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2793.7000000000003s)]
*  And they're like, all right, enough with this, wrap it up and stop with the megaphone thing. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2796.82s)]
*  Someone do something about this. But you end up typically hating the protester. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2800.26s)]
*  But one thing that you shouldn't do if you're Marco Rubio is start arresting people in this way. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2804.5800000000004s)]
*  And making statements in this way. Even if you arrest them, you should write your statement, [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2810.7400000000002s)]
*  be like, all right, this is not what I thought it was. It becomes public just how tenuous your [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2815.38s)]
*  claims are against someone. And how widely refuted they are by people that aren't [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2822.58s)]
*  one gun shop owner who apparently it seems wasn't accurate in his characterization of this person. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2829.14s)]
*  When you juxtapose that against people who actually knew the guy and have no [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2837.7799999999997s)]
*  identitarian reason to contradict him. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2843.7s)]
*  Yeah, it is so blatantly unconstitutional. The way they're going about this because any sort [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2848.4199999999996s)]
*  of limits on speech must be content neutral. And now you have them invoking national security, [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2856.74s)]
*  a bogus national security claim. What threat to national security does a college student [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2863.8599999999997s)]
*  having a protest on campus? What threat does that pose? What threat does Ms. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2871.38s)]
*  Oz Turk at Tufts University co-authoring an op-ed a couple years ago? What threat does that pose [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2876.98s)]
*  to national security? And it's all a lie. As we talked about in other stories this hour, [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2884.26s)]
*  they're willing to lie about anything. But there's nothing about what they're claiming [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2889.38s)]
*  that we should believe or trust because it is so patently bogus. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2896.58s)]
*  And while this is a good development, his immigration status is still ultimately in [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2901.2999999999997s)]
*  jeopardy and they may still try to deport him. It's good that he is not in a holding cell somewhere, [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2906.8199999999997s)]
*  but Mahmood Khalil missed the birth of his child because of these policies. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2913.06s)]
*  And like you're saying, Brett, even some of his biggest and most loud and prominent supporters [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2918.42s)]
*  can't even stomach this kind of stuff. And shockingly on immigration at large or [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2924.42s)]
*  deportations at large, you're even seeing people like Alex Jones who would defend anything Trump [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2929.86s)]
*  did. Watch him wrinkle his nose and his stomach turn over the potential deportation of citizens [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2935.94s)]
*  to El Salvador. These people are so brazen with what they're doing that some of these people [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2944.58s)]
*  can't even defend him anymore. And that to me is shocking. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2952.42s)]
*  Yeah, and the optics are just so creepy. Watching Trump's 100 days rally in Michigan, [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2954.7400000000002s)]
*  it was like a six minute video of people getting their heads shaved because they were deported for [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2964.02s)]
*  quote being in MS-13. Even though we have essentially the Supreme Court saying like, [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2971.86s)]
*  bro, you jumped the gun on a lot of this. And it's really creepy that they want you to be [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2975.86s)]
*  look at these people that look different from me. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2983.86s)]
*  We should arrest them all and kick around them up and kick them out, put them on a train somewhere. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2986.42s)]
*  Those are the scary things. This person disagrees with the powers that be. Let's lock him up and [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2992.1000000000004s)]
*  put him on a train somewhere. That stuff's horrifying. The only upside is it is America. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=2998.9s)]
*  We don't really have very fast trains, so you could probably catch it and get him back. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=3004.74s)]
*  All right, let's get into our last story. It's a funny one. Take a look at this. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=3008.66s)]
*  I'd like to be Pope. That would be my number one choice. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=3039.2999999999997s)]
*  I don't know. I have no preference. I must say we have a cardinal that happens to be out of [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=3044.74s)]
*  a place called New York who's very good. Now, of course, Trump was probably joking about [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=3049.2999999999997s)]
*  wanting to be Pope. And while we wouldn't put it past him, Senator Lindsey Graham weighed in, [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=3057.94s)]
*  urging the cardinals to put the con in conclave. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=3063.7s)]
*  Thank you. In response to that video, Graham posted on X, I was excited to hear that President [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=3069.14s)]
*  Trump is open to the idea of being the next Pope. This would truly be a dark horse candidate, [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=3074.9s)]
*  but I would ask the papal conclave and Catholic faithful to keep an open mind about this possibility. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=3080.74s)]
*  The first Pope-U.S. President combination has many upsides, watching for white smoke. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=3086.5s)]
*  Graham, too, in fairness, may have been joking, but that didn't stop people from taking shots [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=3093.46s)]
*  at him for his typical Trump bootlicking. DNC Vice Chair Malcolm Kenyatta said, [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=3099.38s)]
*  can we send a rescue party? I've never seen a person so far up someone's. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=3105.54s)]
*  Another person on X posted, I legitimately do not understand, short of some kind of humiliation kink, [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=3112.18s)]
*  how you could possibly type those words. Do you not have an ounce of pride? [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=3120.98s)]
*  Brett, is Lindsey Graham joking? And what do you want to see Pope slash President Trump do [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=3128.1000000000004s)]
*  during his first 100 days in the Vatican? Oh my God. Well, I would say that Trump in [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=3136.34s)]
*  his first 100 days at the Vatican should root out sex traffickers. But then again, he did just [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=3142.5s)]
*  import some from Romania. I'm glad I can't remember that guy's name. What's his name? The [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=3149.06s)]
*  fighter guy? Andrew Tate. Andrew Tate. Speaking of Tate, Lindsey Graham, riding Trumps. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=3156.1s)]
*  Neither of you can be Pope, you Baptists, you non-denominational Christian. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=3165.62s)]
*  You're not in that cut of the Venn diagram where you get to be one, [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=3172.02s)]
*  because you have to be Catholic. There are rules, Donald. There are rules. You gotta support [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=3175.94s)]
*  Catholic. Trump himself used to be Presbyterian, now is non-denominational Christian. According to [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=3182.7400000000002s)]
*  the quick Wikipedia search I did on South Carolinian Lindsey Graham, he is Baptist. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=3189.54s)]
*  But I don't think anyone's serious here. But the default setting of Trump is why not say that you [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=3199.94s)]
*  want to do it? And if they give it to you, then you were serious. And if they don't give it to you, [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=3208.82s)]
*  then you were joking. But I think the one thing, whether Lindsey Graham was kidding or not, [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=3212.9s)]
*  and I do think he's kidding, the one truth is he's not funny. And that is sad. He's like, [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=3218.5s)]
*  right on, buddy, right on, bucko. And the only thing that's true about this story is that Lindsey [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=3224.02s)]
*  Graham absolutely has a humiliation kink. Are you kidding me? What do you think? [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=3230.5s)]
*  Yeah, if it was like most other Republicans, it would be clear and obvious that it's just a joke. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=3238.5s)]
*  And while I do think that this was a joke from Lindsey Graham, it fits so perfectly with how he [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=3246.1800000000003s)]
*  responds to anything else that Trump does. It does raise a flag. I'm not 100% sure, [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=3253.22s)]
*  only because it's him and it's so typical of how- [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=3262.5s)]
*  No, stop, stop, stop. John does this too, stop. That's a joke, stop. It's a joke, [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=3265.4599999999996s)]
*  but everything else holds true. We sound weird when we're like, Trump put his hat in the ring [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=3273.3799999999997s)]
*  to be Pope of the United Catholics. He did not do that. Lindsey Graham, is he kidding? [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=3279.86s)]
*  I don't know the answer is very simply, he was absolutely kidding. But you're right to point, [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=3287.54s)]
*  I agree with you to point out that he's always dominant strategy-ing this thing to be like, [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=3292.58s)]
*  I could say I'm definitely kidding, but I know this also makes Donald feel good and maybe he'll [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=3298.5s)]
*  rub my belly a little bit. And he won't hate me after I said that all the horrible stuff I said [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=3303.54s)]
*  about him that he has not earned the right to have me go back on my promise, on my calling [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=3309.54s)]
*  Trump like an evil villain or whatever he called him. The only reason that Lindsey Graham has said [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=3316.2599999999998s)]
*  anything nice about Trump literally ever is because Lindsey got cucked into submission, [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=3320.74s)]
*  so to speak. Yeah, well, despite all the bootlicking, despite all the ass kissing, [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=3327.22s)]
*  Lindsey Graham seemingly has never gotten anything in return from Trump, which [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=3335.3s)]
*  really feeds into the humiliation kink accusation. Just for what? What is this all for? [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=3339.78s)]
*  He doesn't love you. He doesn't love you back, man. I'll never understand it. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=3346.42s)]
*  Right, but if he hates you, then your life's hell. That's the answer. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=3350.34s)]
*  I guess. And he's not gonna do anything good for you, but he can be like, we need a new senator in [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=3357.3s)]
*  this great state of South Carolina, one with a wife or some weird crap like that. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=3364.42s)]
*  We're going further. I mean, Trump would say something like that. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=3373.3s)]
*  Sure. Obviously, nevermind, continue. Brett, thank you so much for joining me today. We've [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=3377.3s)]
*  got a great second hour. John and Yaz are here. Stick around, you don't wanna miss it. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=3384.1s)]
*  I've seen some young, very good looking children. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranoHiK8uW0&t=3390.26s)]
