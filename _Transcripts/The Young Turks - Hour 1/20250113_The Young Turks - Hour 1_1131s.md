"The number of people killed in Gaza during Israel's deadly offensive in the Palestinian enclave is significantly higher than the figures reported by local health authorities, researchers at a leading health university in Britain have found.

In a peer-reviewed study published Thursday in The Lancet journal, researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said they estimated that as many as 64,260 people were killed in "traumatic injury deaths" in Gaza between Oct. 7, 2023 and June 30, 2024."*

The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

What does it mean to be a ‚ÄúYoung Turk?‚Äù

According to the American Heritage Dictionary;
1. Young progressive or insurgent member of an institution, movement, or political party. 
2. Young person who rebels against authority or societal expectations.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

# HORRIFIC Discovery After Study Into Number of People Killed in Gaza Released
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [January 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg)
*  There's a damning report in regard to the death toll in Gaza. Now, we've been hearing a lot about [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=0.0s)]
*  how the death toll has been inflated by the Gazan Health Ministry. But is that really the case? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=5.68s)]
*  Let's get to the details. We wanted to really understand what was the underreporting by the [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  Ministry of Health. So our findings indicate that the numbers from October 7 to June actually were [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=18.16s)]
*  underreported by around 40%. This actually puts the number that the ministry is saying that already [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=26.56s)]
*  people are saying is quite high, is even higher. And these are one of the highest, very high [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=33.36s)]
*  mortality rates. If you look at children under five, children under 10, 15, under 18 year old, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=38.48s)]
*  these mortality rates are quite high. Now, despite constant allegations that the [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=46.32s)]
*  Palestinian Health Ministry has inflated death toll numbers coming out of Gaza, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=52.96s)]
*  it turns out that a new study, a damning analysis suggests that the death toll is actually much [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=59.2s)]
*  higher than what the Palestinian Health Ministry has reported. So this is a peer-reviewed study [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=65.68s)]
*  that was published Thursday of last week in the Lancet Journal. And the researchers at the London [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=71.04s)]
*  School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said that they estimated based on their analysis, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=77.6s)]
*  as many as 64,260 people were killed in traumatic injury deaths in Gaza between October 7th of 2023 [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=83.19999999999999s)]
*  and June 30th of last year. Obviously, some time has passed. The war has continued to rage on [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=93.11999999999999s)]
*  in Gaza. So the death toll is even higher than that. But the authors of the study estimate that [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=100.56s)]
*  the death toll for the first nine months of the war was around 41% higher than the figure of [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=106.24s)]
*  37,877 reported by the Palestinian Health Ministry. Women, children under the age of 18, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=111.67999999999999s)]
*  and people over the age of 65 accounted for 59.1% of the 28,257 deaths for which [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=119.44s)]
*  age and sex data were available. And they did not provide an estimate of how many of those [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=128.64s)]
*  individuals were combatants, but neither does the Palestinian Health Ministry. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=135.36s)]
*  So we're comparing apples to apples here. Now to arrive at a more accurate death toll, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=139.28s)]
*  the authors relied on statistical sampling or statistical sampling technique [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=144.16000000000003s)]
*  that's known as capture-recapture. So if you're unfamiliar with that, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=149.36s)]
*  which is totally fine because I was as well, it's basically something that's been used for [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=154.32000000000002s)]
*  mortality estimation in other war zones, including Kosovo, Sudan, Guatemala, Colombia. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=159.28s)]
*  And so the lead author, Zeynep Jamaluddin, says that this entails basically going through [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=166.08s)]
*  different lists of mortalities, including hospital reports, surveys, and social media obituaries [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=174.16s)]
*  to basically find overlap and come up with a more comprehensive, accurate estimate of the death toll. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=181.68s)]
*  As for why there might have been such a significant undercount, well, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=187.44s)]
*  I have my own theories, right? But Zeynep argues that while the Palestinian Health Ministry [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=192.07999999999998s)]
*  initially did have robust electronic death records, the destruction of Gaza's healthcare [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=197.52s)]
*  system has made it incredibly difficult for them to compile numbers when it comes to the death toll. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=204.0s)]
*  Plus, there are still thousands of people trapped under the rubble in Gaza, which has [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=210.32s)]
*  effectively been leveled by the Israeli Defense Forces, especially in the North. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=214.96s)]
*  And using their analysis of the first nine months of the war, the authors also argue that the [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=219.52s)]
*  current death toll estimate is even likely below the published numbers as well. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=226.0s)]
*  Or yes, well below the actual death toll numbers. So although we only analyze data up to June of [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=232.24s)]
*  2024, they write, the official Health Ministry estimate from October 7th of 2023 to October 6th [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=238.08s)]
*  of 2024 was 41,909. The study says, adding that if that level of underreporting continued from [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=245.52s)]
*  July to October of 2024, it's possible that number of Palestinians killed in Gaza now exceeds 70,000. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=252.88000000000002s)]
*  And by the way, Cenk, even that might be an undercount. So take a look at this, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=261.44s)]
*  and then I wanna get your thoughts. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=265.2s)]
*  In reality, the number of mortality might be higher if we also include the issue of [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=268.08s)]
*  not accessing healthcare, heart attacks, and some of that aspect. Infectious diseases, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=275.91999999999996s)]
*  maternal care, pregnant women not being able to get access to proper delivery, and so on. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=284.4s)]
*  So the situation has been dire, we knew that. But in terms of the number of people who've been [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=291.92s)]
*  killed, the numbers are obviously even more dire than what people expect. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=298.32s)]
*  Yeah, so a lot of thoughts here. First, Lancet Journal is a very respected outlet here. So if [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=302.16s)]
*  they published it, they very likely double check the science on it, etc. So it's a good estimate, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=311.44s)]
*  but of course it's an estimate. So is the number exactly right? Of course, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=318.96s)]
*  they would tell you it's not exactly right. They're estimating based on what they know [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=324.71999999999997s)]
*  about this particular disaster and other disasters that they have studied, right? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=329.03999999999996s)]
*  But the core fact is indisputably true, which is that it's much higher than the 46,000 that [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=333.59999999999997s)]
*  the health ministry in Gaza is reporting. And that's obvious logic, by the way, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=341.12s)]
*  because they're not reporting anyone that hasn't showed up in a hospital or in some [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=346.8s)]
*  sort of health facility and who has passed away, right? Either before they got there or while they [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=352.40000000000003s)]
*  were gone there. But if you're buried on the rubble, well, you didn't get counted. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=357.6s)]
*  And there's tons and tons of people buried under the rubble. And then so I don't believe in adding [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=361.84000000000003s)]
*  in numbers like heart attacks. Heart attack could have happened in a million different ways. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=367.2s)]
*  But did the lack of humanitarian aid lead to starvation and infectious diseases? That's [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=372.0s)]
*  indisputable. I would add those numbers. I would add, so there's a real way of looking at this. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=378.0s)]
*  But now back to the propaganda you normally hear from mainstream media. They will always say, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=384.48s)]
*  but Israel disputes the 46,000 number because they say Hamas. They will say, the Hamas Health [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=391.44s)]
*  Ministry has given that to you. Just saying Hamas in a sentence doesn't prove a goddamn thing. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=399.04s)]
*  Remember, even if you take Israel's wild, outrageous, obviously made up numbers, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=404.64000000000004s)]
*  these days they're claiming, they change the number all the time. These days they're claiming [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=410.56s)]
*  that 17,000 of the people killed were militants. And then press asked them, that's super [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=414.48s)]
*  interesting number. Where'd you get that number from? And they're like, nowhere. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=420.96000000000004s)]
*  They're hilarious. They just make stuff up. But even if you believe that number, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=425.12s)]
*  which you shouldn't believe at all, it's an outrageous, ridiculous lie based on [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=431.44s)]
*  absolutely no evidence. But even if you believed it, that leaves 30 to 50,000 civilians killed. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=436.4s)]
*  Remember, all of this was because 860 Israeli civilians were killed. So now they're saying, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=444.24s)]
*  we've murdered 30 to 50,000 in retaliation for the 860, less than a thousand for civilians. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=452.08s)]
*  There was also a military killed on October 7th. But you see, our civilians are worth more than [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=459.44s)]
*  50 of your civilians because we are superior to you. And we get to colonize you, we get to murder [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=465.91999999999996s)]
*  you, and we get to take your land. So this is yet another piece of overwhelming evidence [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=471.44s)]
*  that adds on to the genocide and ethnic cleansing that the terrorist state of Israel [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=476.64s)]
*  has been doing for well over a year now. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=481.68s)]
*  Now Cenk, you're absolutely right that The Lancet is a respected journal here in the [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=483.91999999999996s)]
*  United States. And the study that we're referring to is a peer reviewed study that's been published [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=489.36s)]
*  in The Lancet. But nonetheless, the Israeli government is rejecting the study. And in fact, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=494.24s)]
*  they claim that there is a hateful bias against Israelis. I mean, it's the go to talking point [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=501.6s)]
*  here. So let's get to a statement that was issued by their embassy in London. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=509.36s)]
*  They write that, as has already been proven countless times before, has it? Any information [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=516.64s)]
*  that derives from Gaza cannot be trusted, nor can you ignore The Lancet's history of anti-Israel [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=522.88s)]
*  bias? What? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=529.28s)]
*  What a bunch of morons calling scientists anti-Semitic because of facts. I mean, it's [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=532.6s)]
*  really peak mental, right? Because to them, their one excuse for everything is, everybody's [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=538.4s)]
*  an anti-Semite, the whole world's against us. So no, we're not the ones lying. Literally, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=546.88s)]
*  everyone else on Earth, all of the press, also by the way, including tons of Jewish members of the [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=552.0s)]
*  press, all the human rights groups, tons of Jewish members in the human rights groups, etc. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=558.0s)]
*  They're all lying, they're all anti-Semites. Israel says, we provide no evidence at all. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=562.32s)]
*  All we just say is, Muslim dirty terrorists, you have to believe us, otherwise you're an anti-Semite. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=568.96s)]
*  No, everyone putting out those statements and all the people in the cabinet, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=574.8s)]
*  in this right wing government of Israel, they're all deep bigots. They're like the worst [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=579.76s)]
*  bigots on Earth. They think Muslim lives are totally and utterly worthless. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=586.16s)]
*  And so, I'm not interested in what these racists think is anti-Semitic, okay? No, none of that. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=593.76s)]
*  Anytime you hear an Israeli, I'm not talking about American Jews, there is anti-Semitism [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=603.28s)]
*  across the world and there is here in America. But when you hear a monster terrorist from [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=608.0s)]
*  the Israeli government talking about anti-Semitism, that's to cover up their own [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=613.6s)]
*  bigotry and racism, which is a thousand times worse than any so-called anti-Semitism at Lancet, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=617.76s)]
*  at the Lancet Journal, one of the most respected medical journals in the world. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=625.0400000000001s)]
*  You'd have to be a lunatic to believe that that's driven by anti-Semitism. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=629.84s)]
*  It's driven by data and science. Your hatred of Palestinians and your deep lust for murdering them [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=633.6s)]
*  is what's actually racist and bigoted. And when you see 50 of your people murdered, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=641.92s)]
*  it's not equivalent of one of ours. That is by definition racist. There's no defense of [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=647.8399999999999s)]
*  Israel left that isn't based on racism. We get to murder them 50 times, a hundred times more [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=653.92s)]
*  than they kill of ours. Why? Because their lives are worthless and our lives are superior. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=660.4s)]
*  And the most important thing in the world, America, send me more of your money. I haven't [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=665.68s)]
*  murdered enough Palestinians yet. That's what I think of this disgusting Israeli government. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=668.8s)]
*  They're also, when they put out statements like this, inherent in the statement, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=673.1999999999999s)]
*  inherent in the denial is an acceptance that these death toll numbers are insanely high [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=680.64s)]
*  and make the Israeli military and government look really bad. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=689.04s)]
*  And it kind of reminds me of what happened in the hospital bombing that took place in Gaza early on [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=693.04s)]
*  in the war, where the Israelis are like, no, no, we didn't do it. It was actually a result of one [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=697.76s)]
*  of Hamas's rockets that misfired and hit the hospital. We would never do it. We would never do [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=702.96s)]
*  it. And then they proceeded to bomb every single hospital in the Gaza Strip. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=708.08s)]
*  So- Everyone, they destroyed every hospital in Gaza, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=713.92s)]
*  every hospital. You know who does that? Terrorists do that. If you say Muslims are terrorists for [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=717.6s)]
*  killing one Israeli, but Israelis are not terrorists for killing 50 Palestinian civilians [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=723.84s)]
*  in return. And that is, by the way, the most generous reading based on totally made up [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=729.6s)]
*  numbers by Israel on the number of terrorists that they killed. And if you say even by Israel's [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=734.48s)]
*  numbers, 50 of them, of course, are not worth one of us. Well, brother and sister, I hate to break [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=739.0400000000001s)]
*  to you, but you're a deep racist and you're supporting a terrorist government that proudly [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=745.36s)]
*  declares that they're not done murdering yet. Self-defense? All of this was an accident. All [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=750.72s)]
*  the civilians killed. They did not intend to kill. That's why they're not terrorists. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=757.12s)]
*  The Muslims are dirty, dirty savages. And whenever they kill, it's not to fight an occupation. It's [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=760.96s)]
*  because they're violent by nature. But when we slaughter and slaughter and slaughter and [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=766.96s)]
*  slaughter Muslims, no, no, we're pure innocent. We didn't intend to kill any- If you believe that [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=771.76s)]
*  Israel didn't intend to kill any civilians in Gaza, please go into a mental health facility. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=778.0s)]
*  You have no idea how much you've grown detached from empirical reality. Your biases have let your [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=783.36s)]
*  brain rot to a point where you think, no, only Israeli lives matter. And you see how everybody [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=791.2s)]
*  else is biased against me. No, I don't see it. I think you're deeply biased against those poor, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=797.04s)]
*  Palestinians. Can you please, for the love of God, stop murdering them? It's not that complicated. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=803.84s)]
*  So the death toll is so egregious. The war has been so brutal toward the civilians in Gaza [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=810.96s)]
*  that now mainstream media is finally speaking up against Joe Biden continuing to fund Israel's [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=820.24s)]
*  efforts in slaughtering people in Gaza. And so here is MSNBC anchor Chris Hayes [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=827.12s)]
*  weighing in on the matter. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=833.76s)]
*  ‚Äî President Biden is gonna hand a blank check for Israel over to the incoming Trump administration. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=834.72s)]
*  $8 million in weaponry given over to an ally waging what I think can only be described as [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=840.72s)]
*  total war in Gaza. That has, according to I think multiple independent experts and [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=846.0s)]
*  reports, reporters and NGOs been committing war crimes. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=851.68s)]
*  And ethnic cleansing according to a former Israeli defense minister, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=855.68s)]
*  where Israeli soldiers say they have been ordered to target and kill innocents arbitrarily, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=860.7199999999999s)]
*  including children. We know which vision of American global engagement the Trump [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=865.1999999999999s)]
*  administration will carry out. But it isn't just Trump who this week is making an absolute [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=869.52s)]
*  mockery of every last lecture we deliver to the Russians or the Chinese or anyone else about [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=875.04s)]
*  respecting human rights and international law. It is President Joe Biden too, leaving a [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=880.96s)]
*  disgraceful legacy. A liberal president doing untold damage to the liberal international order. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=886.8000000000001s)]
*  ‚Äî I mean, what liberal international order? Biden has aided and abetted the deterioration [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=894.96s)]
*  of international law, especially as it pertains to war crimes. And he did that on behalf of Israel. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=901.44s)]
*  Period, full stop. I mean, what liberal international order? What liberal national [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=909.0400000000001s)]
*  order? What are we talking about here? ‚Äî Yeah, total nonsense. So when, look, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=915.52s)]
*  I hated that Russia invaded Ukraine. I'm the only guy who apparently left who believes in [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=920.08s)]
*  what George H.W. Bush said that we should have a new world order where you are not [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=925.2s)]
*  allowed to attack a sovereign country that did not attack you. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=930.88s)]
*  But apparently that's too much to ask for Republicans, for Democrats. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=934.56s)]
*  And so Russia should have never invaded Ukraine. But when Israel attacks five, six of their [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=938.88s)]
*  neighbors, and we go, that's allowed, yeah, that's fine. And we say, well, terrorism is not [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=944.64s)]
*  acceptable. You can't kill innocent civilians. But we allow Israel to kill 50 times the number [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=949.5999999999999s)]
*  of innocent civilians that any terrorist has done to them. We make a mockery. We make a mockery of [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=954.0799999999999s)]
*  the rule of law, international law, our standards, human rights. And by the way, it is a mockery. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=959.2s)]
*  It's a joke. The American leaders are totally lying. They will allow us to kill anyone we like. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=965.6s)]
*  We killed nearly a million people in Iraq. They'll allow Israel to kill endless number of Muslims. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=972.48s)]
*  And they'll never, ever, ever hold them to account. Why? Because AIPAC was the number one donor [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=977.12s)]
*  in American politics this year, in this election cycle. Number one. So they bought our Congress. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=982.1600000000001s)]
*  That's just, look, if you don't know, okay, that's just the reality, man. They bought our [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=988.64s)]
*  Congress. Washington, DC is occupied territory. Okay, it's not just Gaza. God knows what they're [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=994.64s)]
*  gonna do to us next. So now, Chris Hayes, brilliant segment, loved it. You guys should watch the whole [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=1000.08s)]
*  thing. Give Chris a ton of credit, cuz none of the other cowards at MSNBC would dare do that. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=1005.1999999999999s)]
*  Cuz then they would get a stern talking to you. You're not allowed to oppose AIPAC, or Joe Biden, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=1011.68s)]
*  or Kamala Harris. How dare you? You have to keep saying how nice they are. Yeah, I mean, [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=1017.36s)]
*  they funded the genocide. They funded ethnic cleansing according to Israel's own former [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=1021.92s)]
*  defense minister. But you're not allowed to tell the truth on MSNBC. So I appreciate that Chris did [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=1027.28s)]
*  it. Now, I do have to be honest and say, he and along with everyone else should have been doing [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=1033.6s)]
*  for the entirety of the last year. That would have given Israel three months to defend itself, [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=1040.96s)]
*  and slaughter, and slaughter, and slaughter, and still give you a whole year to criticize Biden. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=1045.84s)]
*  But no, no, no, no, you can't do that before an election. Democratic ass must be kissed, [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=1050.8799999999999s)]
*  no matter how corrupt they are, no matter how much they violate all of the principles that [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=1056.32s)]
*  Democratic voters believe in and vote for. But the liars at MSNBC will trick you into thinking [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=1061.76s)]
*  that they're nice people. Well, there was nothing we could do but fund ethnic cleansing and genocide. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=1069.36s)]
*  No, there was a lot you could do. You chose not to do it, Joe Biden, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=1074.64s)]
*  cuz you're deeply corrupt and you're a terrible and evil person. So thank you, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=1078.64s)]
*  Chris, for finally saying it. Of course, none of the other cowards are gonna say it on MSNBC. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=1084.16s)]
*  And it's not too little too late, because we're still funding Israel. We just gave him another [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=1089.44s)]
*  $8 billion to kill more Palestinians, because they haven't murdered enough, according to every [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=1094.3200000000002s)]
*  sick person in power in Washington, DC. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crBrv_GEAhg&t=1100.72s)]
