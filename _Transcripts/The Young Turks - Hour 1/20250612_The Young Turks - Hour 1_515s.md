"US Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla was forcefully removed from a press conference in Los Angeles Thursday and coerced to the ground after attempting to ask Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem a question.
Padilla, California‚Äôs first Latino elected to the US Senate, interrupted Noem as she was giving remarks in the Los Angeles FBI headquarters on the administration‚Äôs response to the protests in that city against Noem‚Äôs agency and its immigration-enforcement efforts. The senator had been in the federal building for a separate briefing when he learned of the press conference."

# WATCH: Senator Alex Padilla MANDHANDLED At Noem's Press Conference
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458)
*  We are staying here to liberate this city from the socialist and the burdensome leadership [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=0.0s)]
*  that this governor and that this mayor have placed on this country and what they have [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=8.08s)]
*  tried to insert into this city. So I wanna say thank you to every single person [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=12.56s)]
*  that has been able to do this. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=18.64s)]
*  Senator Alex Padilla, I have questions for the secretary. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=20.639999999999997s)]
*  Because the fact of the matter is a half a dozen criminals that you're rotating on your- [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=24.88s)]
*  But you just witnessed was United States Senator Alex Padilla getting forcibly dragged out of [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=30.4s)]
*  DHS secretary Kristi Noem's press conference, which took place earlier today. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=40.959999999999994s)]
*  She was speaking from the Los Angeles headquarters of the FBI about the protests [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=45.92s)]
*  specifically against her agency. Now Padilla interrupted to ask her questions before [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=52.64s)]
*  being restrained as you can see that video by security guards shoved out of the room [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=59.440000000000005s)]
*  and handcuffed. Let's take a look. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=63.760000000000005s)]
*  On the ground, on the ground, hands on your back, hands on your back. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=76.16s)]
*  If you let me, get on my hands, go ahead, put me on my back. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=80.64s)]
*  All right, all right, all right. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=83.28s)]
*  Pull, pull that hand, lay flat, lay flat. Other hand, sir. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=83.84s)]
*  Other hand. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=88.48s)]
*  So as you can imagine, Democrats immediately spoke out, including the always aggressive, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=93.68s)]
*  strategically minded Chuck Schumer, who said that he was sickened by the incident and demanded [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=101.28s)]
*  immediate answers as to what the hell went on. Mayor Karen Bass of Los Angeles called it a [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=107.04s)]
*  warrant, but DHS defended their decision to manhandle Padilla shortly afterwards. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=114.16s)]
*  Senator Padilla chose disrespectful political theater and interrupted a live press conference [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=120.08s)]
*  without identifying himself or having his Senate security pin on. Would it be okay? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=124.88s)]
*  Would you guys be cool with it if you were able to identify him as a United States Senator or [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=130.56s)]
*  something? Tells me not so much. Did he lunge toward Kristi Noem? I didn't see any lunging [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=134.48s)]
*  toward Kristi Noem. Look, I'm gonna be honest with you guys. It did come across as cringey [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=143.28s)]
*  political theater. To me, it did. But he did not lunge at Kristi Noem, okay? He just didn't. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=147.28s)]
*  That's just not true. We all saw it. Anyway, the rest of the post reads, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=153.84s)]
*  Padilla was told repeatedly to back away and did not comply with officers' repeated commands. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=158.64s)]
*  Secret Service thought he was an attacker and officers acted appropriately. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=164.88s)]
*  Now, there has been an update to this whole kerfuffle. I'll give it to you in just a second. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=170.23999999999998s)]
*  What are your initial thoughts, Was? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=174.07999999999998s)]
*  Look, at a certain point, I don't think the mealy mouth stuff that Chuck Schumer's done [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=178.16s)]
*  or any of the Democratic leadership, to be honest, because where are they right now on this? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=184.64s)]
*  Gavin Newsom is the governor of the state, so he's making himself sort of the face of [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=190.72s)]
*  opposing Donald Trump's policies vis-a-vis the deportation regime. But where's everybody else? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=196.07999999999998s)]
*  Where's Hot Jefferies on this? Where's Chuck Schumer? What do they think we should be? What [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=202.64s)]
*  is the opposition? How do we think an ideal version of overhauling our immigration policy would look? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=208.8s)]
*  Where are they? And that's the problem with the Dems, and that's why they lose on this issue. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=217.28s)]
*  They have no coherence at all. If the policy is, yo, we believe in the status quo. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=222.72s)]
*  We believe that when Joe Biden signed those orders to expand the people who could claim asylum and [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=231.44s)]
*  the people we were giving safe refuge to, here's why he did it, here's why it's fine, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=237.44s)]
*  here's why it's going great, here's what we should be doing to process it. Okay, cool. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=242.0s)]
*  Or here's why, you know what, Joe Biden might have had it wrong. We wanna do nothing. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=247.12s)]
*  There's nothing. What is the Democratic party's position on what's going on right now? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=253.76s)]
*  The Republicans can simply tell you, 12 million extra people came, whether that number's accurate [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=260.88s)]
*  or not, I don't know, 12 million extra people came, we gotta get them the hell out. That's the [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=266.08s)]
*  message. They have a message, they got something. I mean, it goes back to the broader problem with [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=270.24s)]
*  the Democratic party, the lack of a leader. And I'm sorry, Hakeem Jeffries is not- [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=279.12s)]
*  Oh, God. He's not made of the stuff [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=284.08s)]
*  necessary to be thought of as a leader. He's just not. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=287.03999999999996s)]
*  Hakeem Jeffries could not lead a prostitute to bed. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=290.0s)]
*  I promise you, he is nobody's leader. He is just not. I'm just telling you. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=295.52s)]
*  You're my favorite. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=301.52s)]
*  I'm just telling you, that dude is not a leader. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=302.71999999999997s)]
*  No, you're right, you're right. I mean, he's the guy who basically threatened the Trump [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=305.84s)]
*  administration if they end up arresting one of their members. And then they proceeded to arrest [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=310.79999999999995s)]
*  one of their members. And my favorite part is like, they're gonna find out, they're gonna find [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=317.28s)]
*  out, they're gonna find out. And then, okay, what did they find out? That you have no plan. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=323.76s)]
*  You guys have no plan. That's the problem. There's no plan, there's no strategy at all. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=327.76s)]
*  But apparently, Padilla and Noam buried the hatchet. Here's what she told reporters [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=334.71999999999997s)]
*  after the press conference. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=339.59999999999997s)]
*  We had a great conversation, sat down and talked for 10, 15 minutes about operations in LA, some [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=340.72s)]
*  activities of the Department of Homeland Security. And so I thought it was very productive. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=347.92s)]
*  And I wish that he would have reached out and identified himself and let us know who he was [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=351.6s)]
*  and that he wanted to talk. His approach was something that I don't think was appropriate [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=357.76000000000005s)]
*  at all. But the conversation was great and we're gonna continue to communicate. We exchanged [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=362.96000000000004s)]
*  phone numbers and we're gonna continue to talk and we can communicate better. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=367.52s)]
*  Why was that the action you decided to take? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=370.96s)]
*  I'll let the law enforcement speak to how this situation was handled. But I will say that [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=372.64s)]
*  people need to identify themselves before they start lunging at people during press conferences. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=378.32s)]
*  Well, Alex Padilla saw things a little differently. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=385.12s)]
*  There peacefully at one point I had a question. And so I began to ask a question. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=389.44s)]
*  I was almost immediately forcibly removed from the room. I was forced to the ground. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=395.12s)]
*  And I was handcuffed. If this is how this administration responds to a senator with a [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=403.36s)]
*  question, if this is how the Department of Homeland Security responds to a senator with a question, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=409.28000000000003s)]
*  you can only imagine what they're doing to farm workers, to cooks, to day laborers out in the [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=415.76s)]
*  Los Angeles community and throughout California and throughout the country. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=425.59999999999997s)]
*  So that last point was I think a pretty legitimate, incredible point to make. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=433.12s)]
*  What are your final thoughts on this was? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=438.24s)]
*  I mean, I'm glad he's out there making the case for these migrants, these workers, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=439.92s)]
*  these undocumented folks. I'm happy that at least somebody wants to put a voice and make the case [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=447.52000000000004s)]
*  to why these people belong in our country. And they aren't just visitors. They're part of what [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=454.96000000000004s)]
*  we do. They're part of why we're great. And I would just like to hear some Democrats explain [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=460.48s)]
*  to the world their worldview that we want America to be a great country that people are dying to [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=467.36s)]
*  get to. There's something to the fact that people are willing to travel ungodly amounts of freaking [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=475.68s)]
*  miles and traverse lands to come here. Sure, if we need to tighten up the processing of that, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=483.92s)]
*  okay, cool, let's have that conversation. But make the case that yeah, we're a country that [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=493.28000000000003s)]
*  people are dying to get to. And a lot of these people deserve to be here. You know what I mean? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=499.12s)]
*  And I'd love to see somebody give voice to that. And that's at least a start. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wx7xl-458&t=504.4s)]
