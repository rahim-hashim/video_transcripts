# Senators PANIC After Americans DISAPPROVE Of Trump's 'Big, Beautiful Bill'
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U)
*  Republican voters, they don't care. They don't care. I mean, look, cut taxes even if the deficit [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=0.0s)]
*  increases. You go back 33 years ago, it was just 22% who said cut taxes even if the deficit [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  increases. But the party of fiscal responsibility is no more. Now 74% of Republicans say cut taxes [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  even if deficit increases. Now while working class Republicans might absolutely love the idea of [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=18.16s)]
*  seeing their taxes cut. It appears that according to new polling from Quinnipiac, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=24.96s)]
*  the majority of Americans do not favor Trump's so-called big beautiful bill. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=31.28s)]
*  And at the same time, he is deciding to in a very petty way go after Republican lawmakers [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=36.24s)]
*  who are standing in the way of the passage of said big beautiful bill. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=42.88s)]
*  So we're gonna give you an update on Senator Rand Paul and Republican congressman Thomas Massie in [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=46.8s)]
*  just a minute. But first some details on this poll. So when it comes to how Americans feel [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=53.04s)]
*  about it, whether they support the big beautiful bill, only 27%, according to this Quinnipiac [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=58.72s)]
*  poll say they support it. 53% oppose the big beautiful bill, 20% not so sure they offered no [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=66.08s)]
*  opinion. Now, let's get to what the latest is, right? So while 67% of Republicans support the [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=73.36s)]
*  bill, so if you kind of break it down based on partisanship, still enjoys some favorability [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=83.44s)]
*  among Republican voters. High numbers of Republicans also support keeping Medicaid funding at current [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=90.64s)]
*  levels, which of course this bill seeks to change and cut. So 21% believe that it should increase. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=98.88s)]
*  These are Republicans, guys, Republicans. Turns out a lot of them are actually [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=106.56s)]
*  in need of Medicaid. So 21% believe it should increase, 56% believe it should stay about [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=111.75999999999999s)]
*  the same, 18% believe it should decrease, 4% offered no opinion. And look, combined, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=119.36s)]
*  77% of Republicans believe federal Medicaid funding should either be increased or should [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=129.68s)]
*  not be cut at all. Now, Americans also care much more about the issue of Medicaid than the issue [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=137.44s)]
*  of increasing the deficit, which is basically what you saw in the video featuring Harry Enton [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=142.8s)]
*  earlier. And the deficit is what Republican opponents of the quote unquote big beautiful bill [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=149.28s)]
*  cite as their biggest concern. So I wanna be clear here. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=156.0s)]
*  It's not that the majority of Americans don't like the bill because it adds to the deficit. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=161.28s)]
*  There are other reasons for why they don't like the bill and it's tied to the cuts to our social [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=168.88s)]
*  safety net. Medicaid being one of them, yes, but also SNAP benefits have been targeted [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=173.6s)]
*  in this bill as well. And as we know, and as we shared with you earlier this week, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=179.04s)]
*  the Senate is currently thinking of ways to make this bill a little less expensive. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=183.36s)]
*  So they're targeting the tax cuts that would benefit service workers or American workers [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=187.52s)]
*  in general. So no tax on tips, they're looking to get rid of that, torpedo it from the bill. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=193.60000000000002s)]
*  No tax on overtime, they're looking to torpedo that as well. Who knows what the final bill will [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=198.72000000000003s)]
*  look like after the Senate is done with it. But I think most Americans are wisening up to what [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=203.52s)]
*  the real priorities are here among our Republican lawmakers. Now, yesterday we let you know that [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=208.96s)]
*  Senator Rand Paul was uninvited from the annual White House picnic. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=215.68s)]
*  Massey has now suffered the same fate writing on X, incredibly petty and short-sighted of Trump's [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=221.04000000000002s)]
*  staff to exclude Republicans from the annual White House picnic while inviting Pelosi and [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=228.56s)]
*  every Democrat. I always give my few tickets to my staff and their kids, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=234.16000000000003s)]
*  but apparently this year my tickets have been withheld as well. Low class. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=239.92000000000002s)]
*  Now, Trump is denying that he uninvited Rand Paul, though he hasn't mentioned Massey yet, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=246.4s)]
*  so that's something to know. He wrote on social media that of course Senator Rand Paul and his [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=254.88000000000002s)]
*  beautiful wife and family are invited to the big White House party tonight. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=259.68s)]
*  He's the toughest vote in the history of the US Senate, but why wouldn't he be? Besides, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=264.56s)]
*  it gives me more time to get his vote on the great big beautiful bill. You guys get the point. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=270.64s)]
*  And Paul responded by saying, this is a promising sign of things to come. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=276.24s)]
*  And if there's one thing the president and I agree on, it's that my wife is beautiful. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=282.08s)]
*  I'm sure your wife is beautiful. I wouldn't want Trump of all people to talk about the beauty of [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=289.52s)]
*  your wife, but okay, do you boo. And then he posted this. Turns out my grandson is actually [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=293.12s)]
*  invited to the congressional picnic. My God, that's so embarrassing, dude. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=298.71999999999997s)]
*  Okay, I toss it over to you, Woss. Take it away. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=305.12s)]
*  That is so cringe. It's just after his little mini press conference, making a show of himself, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=308.0s)]
*  being being disinvited from Donald Trump's Chuck E. Cheese birthday party [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=316.4s)]
*  and complaining to his mom and dad is just so embarrassing. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=323.84s)]
*  And now he's retweeting and quote tweeting. It's a joke. And to get back to the Medicaid portion of [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=328.24s)]
*  this, our audience knows traditionally before third way democratic party thinking and [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=335.28s)]
*  triangulation and all the other neoliberal centrist crap that swept the party. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=345.76s)]
*  The Democrats used to have a chokehold on the working class, broad coalition. Even when they [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=351.76s)]
*  would lose in the Senate, they would dominate the house. From FDR until Reagan, we're talking about [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=357.92s)]
*  basically 50 years uninterrupted domination of the House of Representatives because as the founders [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=365.84s)]
*  intended, the House is like the portion of the government of the people. It's supposed to be the [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=372.88s)]
*  part that's closest and lowest to the ground. Well, since the Democrats for 30 years have decided [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=380.64s)]
*  to seed ground with working class voters, preferring suburban and more affluent voters that [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=387.6s)]
*  more aligned with their fancy degrees and college education and all of that stuff. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=396.15999999999997s)]
*  Guess what? Those working class voters did not cease to exist. They've become Republicans. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=401.92s)]
*  And the people who use Medicaid are working class voters. So what does that mean? Back in the 80s, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=409.04s)]
*  yeah, you could probably demonize something like Medicaid or food stamps or something like that [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=416.40000000000003s)]
*  as a Republican to your entire base when you were a more affluent party. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=420.8s)]
*  Now that a lot of your voters are closer to the ground, more down home voters, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=425.59999999999997s)]
*  this is actually a consideration. You can't just talk about welfare queens and people [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=432.64s)]
*  suckling at the teeth of the federal government as greedy and freeloading. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=438.64s)]
*  No, those are your people, okay? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=443.52s)]
*  That's actually such a good point. It really is because [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=445.91999999999996s)]
*  there has been a realignment. And when I say realignment, I'm not under any impression that [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=451.91999999999996s)]
*  the current Republican party is the party of the working class. I know that it's not. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=457.59999999999997s)]
*  However, working class voters have increasingly flocked to the right specifically because of [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=462.47999999999996s)]
*  Donald Trump's pro economic populist messaging on the campaign trail. But when those policies [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=470.24s)]
*  don't actually come to fruition and when the situation is far worse for working class Americans, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=478.96000000000004s)]
*  well, I mean, there will be a reckoning for the Republican party. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=485.2s)]
*  The only problem is was, my heart breaks for working class Americans because there's [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=489.84000000000003s)]
*  nowhere to go right now. The Democratic party is not representative of the working class. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=495.84s)]
*  Yes, you still have a few lawmakers, a few people in Congress who say that they want to champion [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=502.08s)]
*  these policies that would be far more beneficial for working class Americans. But other than that, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=509.92s)]
*  I mean, the whole of the Democratic establishment is basically the opposite. So yeah. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=515.28s)]
*  Yeah, and this is a test, honestly, for Barry's sort of vision for the ACA where because they were [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=521.12s)]
*  too corrupt to go with a public option for the people, they were like, yo, we're gonna do this [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=531.1999999999999s)]
*  Medicaid mandate, this state mandate. They get this free federal money. And eventually, many of [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=538.4799999999999s)]
*  these conservative states caved, got their, we're talking about the reddest states in the country, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=544.3199999999999s)]
*  got their citizens on Medicaid. And they like it cuz it's a great program. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=550.32s)]
*  And now we'll see if the theory of getting them on there is gonna protect it. We'll see if that [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=556.32s)]
*  theory holds. It looks like it's gonna be on a chopping block though. Yep. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCeoFErna1U&t=561.0400000000001s)]
