TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.
The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.
On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.
Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.
Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.
TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.
TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.
TYT‚Äôs 24/7 programming is available on YouTube TV, Samsung TV, Plus, Roku, Xumo, TCLtv+, Fubo, and more.
TYT is also available as a podcast on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, TuneIn, Amazon Music, and more.

# Trump-Supporting Comedian RAILS Against Him
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc)
*  I didn't realize how grateful I [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=0.0s)]
*  needed to be to Israel for this. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=2.58s)]
*  I didn't realize how much it was in [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=5.46s)]
*  my interest that the government of [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=8.2s)]
*  a Middle Eastern country I've never [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=10.92s)]
*  been to and has very little effect [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=13.68s)]
*  on my life get decapitated and [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=16.28s)]
*  replaced with another government. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=18.6s)]
*  I want to thank Israel for this. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=21.72s)]
*  Is Iran the reason for any of this? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=23.28s)]
*  Is Iran the reason the corporations [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=25.12s)]
*  in America just pillage and [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=27.28s)]
*  leave the trail of death and [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=29.0s)]
*  destruction in their wake? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=30.6s)]
*  Is Iran the reason we have no [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=32.2s)]
*  healthcare? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=33.72s)]
*  I mean, this is the most [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=35.1s)]
*  disdain I've ever heard. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=36.28s)]
*  That's comedian Tim Dillon going [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=40.28s)]
*  scorched earth on Israel and [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=42.24s)]
*  Warhawks in the media who are [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=43.96s)]
*  advocating for the United States to [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=45.68000000000001s)]
*  get involved in an all out war with [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=47.8s)]
*  Iran. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=49.72s)]
*  We'll hear more of his spicy takes [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=50.22s)]
*  in just a minute, Cenk, but [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=52.0s)]
*  initial thoughts here. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=53.52s)]
*  Yeah, thank God for [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=55.52s)]
*  guys like Dillon. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=56.84s)]
*  If that hurts your feelings, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=57.76s)]
*  I couldn't care less. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=59.08s)]
*  So what we needed in this country [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=60.48s)]
*  was independent media. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=62.199999999999996s)]
*  And so what we had was mainstream [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=63.48s)]
*  media and it was a prison. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=65.52s)]
*  It was an absolute prison, but [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=67.2s)]
*  you couldn't get any opinion out [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=69.24s)]
*  that wasn't sanctioned by the [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=71.28s)]
*  special interests in Washington. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=73.12s)]
*  Now there's a prison break and [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=75.32s)]
*  we're in the populous woods. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=76.88s)]
*  So now, Tim Dillon and [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=78.75999999999999s)]
*  guys like him supported Trump, but [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=80.28s)]
*  there's nothing tying him [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=82.56s)]
*  financially or otherwise to Trump [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=84.2s)]
*  or anyone else. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=86.44s)]
*  So they're saying, that's it. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=87.36s)]
*  I'm going to tell you the truth. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=89.24s)]
*  And I don't work for [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=90.56s)]
*  established media. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=91.32s)]
*  I don't need to lie to you. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=92.56s)]
*  I don't have any sponsors that [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=93.88s)]
*  demand that I lied to you. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=94.88s)]
*  I don't have any special interests [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=95.8s)]
*  that demand that I lied to you. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=97.08s)]
*  So I'm going to tell you the truth. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=98.12s)]
*  The truth is we don't need to be [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=99.24s)]
*  in this war at all. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=100.24s)]
*  Israel is trying to drag us into [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=101.72s)]
*  this war. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=103.4s)]
*  And now how are they going to shut [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=104.72s)]
*  up all the independent media? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=105.6s)]
*  Okay, now you got to shut up [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=107.16s)]
*  the young Turks, which they've been [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=108.16s)]
*  trying to do for 20 some odd years. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=109.32s)]
*  Then you got to go shut up [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=111.56s)]
*  Joe Rogan and Tim Dillon and [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=112.36s)]
*  Andrew Schultz and Charlemagne. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=113.56s)]
*  It's hard to shut all these people [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=115.24s)]
*  up, especially if you pretended [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=117.24s)]
*  that you were in favor of free [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=118.83999999999999s)]
*  speech, you're against cancel [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=120.19999999999999s)]
*  culture, and you are anti-war. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=121.8s)]
*  So Donald Trump is in a lot of [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=124.19999999999999s)]
*  trouble because he is violating [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=126.0s)]
*  every single court tenant that he [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  promised to his own voters. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=130.28s)]
*  So let's give you a lot more of [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=132.88s)]
*  this and you see where it's coming [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=133.88s)]
*  from. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=134.92s)]
*  Yeah, Dylan focused his anti-war [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=136.4s)]
*  argument on the fact that people [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=138.12s)]
*  here in the United States have more [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=139.68s)]
*  pressing things to worry about than [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=141.35999999999999s)]
*  Iran's nuclear program. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=143.12s)]
*  Your own society is declining [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=144.52s)]
*  perpetually year after year, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=148.16s)]
*  annually things get worse. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=152.16000000000003s)]
*  People are fleeing. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=155.92000000000002s)]
*  And you're out there saying the [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=159.60000000000002s)]
*  most important thing to the British [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=162.08s)]
*  working class or [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=165.12s)]
*  the American working class is that [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=166.60000000000002s)]
*  the Iranian regime is decapitated [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=169.8s)]
*  with Israeli airstrikes. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=172.92s)]
*  Can you imagine knocking on the [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=175.92s)]
*  door of a double wide trailer and [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=178.68s)]
*  grabbing a person who was five [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=181.48s)]
*  months away from being homeless in [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=184.0s)]

*  biggest problem? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=189.24s)]
*  Do you think the word Iran is going [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=190.6s)]
*  to come up much? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=192.6s)]
*  How do we get in this position? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=193.56s)]
*  Well, Iran, when your insurance [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=194.8s)]
*  won't cover a knee operation and [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=197.16s)]
*  you have to go bankrupt to replace [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=199.48s)]
*  your hip, is your main concern that [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=202.07999999999998s)]
*  Iran be decapitated? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=205.16s)]
*  This is the craziest I've ever [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=206.92s)]
*  heard in my life. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=210.32s)]
*  Yeah, what about our own backyard? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=212.16s)]
*  Along these same lines, here is [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=214.79999999999998s)]
*  Dylan explaining how the majority [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=216.83999999999997s)]
*  of American voters in 2024 felt [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=219.0s)]
*  about funding another country's [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=220.95999999999998s)]
*  wars when our own house just does [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=223.04s)]
*  not seem to be in order. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=225.04s)]

*  think it's a special ally. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=621.0s)]

*  Get rid of our own poll, okay? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=626.28s)]
*  So what Dylan said there is so [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=627.52s)]

*  And a lot of people have different [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=747.52s)]
*  opinions. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=748.76s)]
*  I'm curious how you guys are going [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=749.28s)]
*  to come out on this. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=750.28s)]
*  No, they actually want war. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=751.12s)]
*  A lot of people on the left [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=752.6s)]
*  believe that. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=753.52s)]
*  No, they're all lying at all times. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=754.36s)]
*  Even though they're all saying that [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=757.5600000000001s)]
*  they're anti war or tons of them [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=758.9200000000001s)]
*  are saying they're anti war. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=760.2s)]
*  I don't believe them and [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=761.64s)]
*  I don't want their help even though [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=762.84s)]
*  they're in power. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=764.36s)]
*  I just want to hate them. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=765.76s)]
*  B, no, they're against the war, but [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=766.9200000000001s)]
*  none of them are rebelling. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=768.76s)]
*  Again, there's Dylan rebelling and [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=770.4s)]
*  we're going to show you in a little [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=772.16s)]
*  bit Tucker and Marjorie Taylor [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=773.72s)]
*  Greene and said are rebelling. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=775.12s)]
*  But anyway, C, yes, they are anti [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=776.2s)]
*  war and are pushing Trump not to [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=778.12s)]
*  get involved. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=779.84s)]
*  Okay, so curious what you guys [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=781.12s)]
*  think tyt.com but there's a lot of [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=782.84s)]
*  those on the left that are so [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=784.6800000000001s)]
*  mad at the right that we think, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=786.24s)]
*  I don't want any help from them. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=788.0400000000001s)]
*  I don't know Sharon, me, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=790.4000000000001s)]
*  I'm a practical person. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=792.12s)]
*  We're not in charge. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=794.6s)]
*  Trump is in charge. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=796.8000000000001s)]
*  Trump is not going to listen to [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=798.12s)]
*  the left. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=799.4000000000001s)]
*  But there is some chance that he's [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=800.44s)]
*  going to listen to his own base, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=802.2800000000001s)]
*  which he does do a decent amount of [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=803.96s)]
*  times. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=805.8000000000001s)]
*  And it looks like the base is [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=806.9200000000001s)]
*  turning. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=808.12s)]
*  So I'm encouraged by that. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=808.76s)]
*  When you look at the Dylan [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=811.4399999999999s)]
*  broadcast, what do you think? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=812.72s)]
*  I think, yeah, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=816.08s)]
*  enough of them are turning against [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=817.36s)]
*  Trump led by Dylan and others. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=819.88s)]
*  I just wonder how much steam it'll [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=822.72s)]
*  pick up but I think Trump does [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=824.2s)]
*  listen to the Poles, Cenk. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=825.52s)]
*  And I do think that when his base [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=826.92s)]
*  starts to erode a little bit, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=828.6s)]
*  I mean, just look what he's doing [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=830.16s)]
*  with, we'll exempt the farmers, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=832.08s)]
*  we'll do this and that with his [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=834.04s)]
*  immigration enforcement policies [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=835.76s)]
*  with ICE. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=838.12s)]
*  So I think you're right. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=838.84s)]
*  A lot of people on the left have [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=840.84s)]
*  blinders on because a lot of water [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=843.08s)]
*  under the bridge and it seems like [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=845.64s)]
*  the floodgates are open and [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=848.04s)]
*  it keeps coming. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=849.96s)]
*  But yeah, I think it makes sense, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=851.48s)]
*  I do. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrOsvp4KHTc&t=853.16s)]
