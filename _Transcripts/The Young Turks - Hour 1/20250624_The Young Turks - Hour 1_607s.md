TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.
The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.
On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.
Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.
Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.
TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.
TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.
TYT‚Äôs 24/7 programming is available on YouTube TV, Samsung TV, Plus, Roku, Xumo, TCLtv+, Fubo, and more.

# Joe Rogan Has HARSH WORDS For Trump
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A)
*  Bro, these ice razors are nuts, man. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=0.0s)]
*  Watching this protest on television, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=2.64s)]
*  it's like- [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=4.94s)]
*  The razor nuts, the protest, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  the- [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=7.96s)]
*  All of it, yeah. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=8.46s)]
*  I think both sides are taking it [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=9.16s)]
*  a little too hard. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=10.44s)]
*  Well, I don't think if the Trump [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=11.6s)]
*  administration, if they're running [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=13.56s)]
*  and they said we're going to go to [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=15.84s)]
*  Home Depot, and we're going to [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=17.72s)]
*  arrest all the people at Home Depot, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  we're going to go to construction [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=21.28s)]
*  sites and we're going to just [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=23.0s)]
*  tackle people at construction sites. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=24.64s)]
*  I don't think anybody was signed up [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=26.72s)]
*  for that. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=28.240000000000002s)]
*  The criminals and [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=28.8s)]
*  the gang members first. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=29.64s)]
*  Preach. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=30.68s)]
*  Now last week, Joe Rogan called out [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=32.64s)]
*  the Trump administration for [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=34.84s)]
*  the right reasons for expanding [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=36.68s)]
*  the scope of their ice raids. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=38.68s)]
*  And he also had some pretty harsh [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=40.72s)]
*  words for the policemen who shot [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=42.84s)]
*  an Australian journalist, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=44.84s)]
*  a reporter with a rubber bullet [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=46.760000000000005s)]
*  during the LA demonstrations. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=48.64s)]
*  Here's a clip of that. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=50.96s)]
*  The problem is there's cops that [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=53.16s)]
*  just shoot people with rubber [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=54.400000000000006s)]
*  bullets for no reason. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=55.480000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=56.88s)]
*  See that lady that Australian [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=57.400000000000006s)]
*  reporter? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=58.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=59.080000000000005s)]
*  Did you see that video? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=59.760000000000005s)]
*  It's pretty hilarious. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=60.56s)]
*  It's nuts, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=61.64s)]
*  because you see the guy do it. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=62.6s)]
*  You see the cop, just look at her [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=64.56s)]
*  while she's talking. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=66.16s)]
*  She's clearly not a criminal. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=67.04s)]
*  She's just reporting the news. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=68.2s)]
*  And he shoots her in the leg with [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=69.8s)]
*  a rubber bullet. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=71.28s)]
*  I can't believe that he would do [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=71.96000000000001s)]
*  this. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=73.52000000000001s)]
*  Do you want to know why people get [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=74.04s)]
*  angry at cops? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=75.80000000000001s)]
*  It's like that. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=77.04s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=79.88s)]
*  And so when it comes to policing, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=81.0s)]
*  I am not under any illusion that we [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=83.0s)]
*  don't need police, that we can [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=84.84s)]
*  abolish them and [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=86.6s)]
*  everything will be great. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=87.76s)]
*  No, no, we absolutely need to [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  reform policing. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=90.60000000000001s)]
*  None of that has happened, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=92.12s)]
*  which is infuriating. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=93.28s)]
*  And that cop who shot that reporter [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=94.48s)]
*  with a rubber bullet should not [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=96.32000000000001s)]
*  only be fired, but [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=98.08000000000001s)]
*  he should be prosecuted for assault. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=99.24000000000001s)]
*  Okay, what are you doing shooting [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=102.2s)]
*  a journalist as she's doing her job? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=103.60000000000001s)]
*  She wasn't causing any problems, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=105.16000000000001s)]
*  by the way. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=106.80000000000001s)]
*  Anyway, I love that [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=107.92000000000002s)]
*  Rogan spoke out about this. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=108.92000000000002s)]
*  And I want to get into some of [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=110.56s)]
*  the details about who's actually [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=112.12s)]
*  being deported in just a second, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=113.84s)]
*  because Cato Institute looked into [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=115.60000000000001s)]
*  that, Cato Canchink first. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=117.48s)]
*  Yeah, so everybody's a little bit [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=118.8s)]
*  wrong here from the two different [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=120.84s)]
*  sides. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=123.0s)]
*  So Rogan's left wing critics say [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=123.68s)]
*  that he doesn't disagree with [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=125.76s)]
*  Trump at all. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=127.80000000000001s)]
*  Well, that doesn't make any sense. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=128.8s)]
*  You just saw it with your own eyes, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=130.72s)]
*  right? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=132.12s)]
*  On the other hand, when Rogan says [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=132.8s)]
*  if he said we're going to deport [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=134.56s)]
*  people from construction sites and [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=136.24s)]
*  stuff, nobody would have signed on, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=138.16s)]
*  that's also not true. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=140.2s)]
*  So there is a portion of MAGA that [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=141.52s)]
*  says, yeah, yeah, from construction [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=143.6s)]
*  sites, restaurants, wherever, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=145.96s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=148.08s)]
*  You're right about that, yes, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=148.92000000000002s)]
*  you're right about that. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=150.16s)]
*  So, but the main point that Rogan's [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=151.28s)]
*  driving towards is true, which is [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=153.84s)]
*  most people, including the decisive [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=156.24s)]
*  voters in the middle that went with [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=158.84s)]
*  Trump, did not sign up for going in [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=161.24s)]
*  the middle of the country and [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=163.8s)]
*  snatching people up. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=166.0s)]
*  Yeah, from Home Depot parking lots, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=168.04000000000002s)]
*  day laborers, really, those are [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=169.44s)]
*  the people we're going to be [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=170.72s)]
*  targeted? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=171.56s)]
*  I mean, it's worse than that. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=172.12s)]
*  There's people that are like high [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=173.16s)]
*  hiding in attics and some kid [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=175.79999999999998s)]
*  climbed a tree to avoid the cops. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=177.67999999999998s)]
*  I mean, it's just madness, right? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=180.23999999999998s)]
*  When unmarked cars show up with [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=181.51999999999998s)]
*  ICE agents who are wearing plane [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=183.95999999999998s)]
*  clothes and they violently snatch [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=186.64s)]
*  people up, and by the way, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=189.44s)]
*  there's videos of this, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=191.39999999999998s)]
*  you can all watch it. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=193.0s)]
*  Okay, that scares people across [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=194.2s)]
*  the board, that is not what people [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=196.11999999999998s)]
*  signed up for. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=198.04s)]
*  So everybody does projections. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=198.92s)]
*  So the MAGA guys then make [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=200.6s)]
*  the mistake of thinking that [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=201.95999999999998s)]
*  everybody thinks like they do. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=203.52s)]
*  And America is going to love it [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=204.96s)]
*  when people are snatched up off [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=206.44s)]
*  the streets. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=208.04s)]
*  And America doesn't love it. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=208.88s)]
*  The polling shows that America [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=210.28s)]
*  hates it. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=211.68s)]
*  And that's why Rogan has got his [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=212.48000000000002s)]
*  finger on the pulse on this one, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=214.04000000000002s)]
*  right? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=215.6s)]
*  Now he does it on every issue, but [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=216.12s)]
*  on this issue, he's right. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=217.88s)]
*  And so, and by the way, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=219.28s)]
*  why is the left, some folks on the [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=220.88s)]
*  left, instinctually say that Rogan [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=223.24s)]
*  is a fascist or with Trump and [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=225.84s)]
*  is part of a cult, etc., [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=227.96s)]
*  because they're tribalists. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=229.8s)]
*  And so they assume that Rogan [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=232.24s)]
*  thinks like they do, that they're [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=233.68s)]
*  going to be, that he's going to be [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=235.48000000000002s)]
*  tribalists and only support one [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=237.28s)]
*  person or one party, right? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=239.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=240.56s)]
*  Or one ideology. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=241.06s)]
*  No, in this case, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=241.92000000000002s)]
*  he's looking at it as neutral and [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=242.96s)]
*  he's right about where the American [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=244.68s)]
*  people are. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=246.60000000000002s)]
*  So I want to talk a little bit [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=247.12s)]
*  about what the Cato Institute just [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=248.48000000000002s)]
*  released in regard to data [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=250.28s)]
*  pertaining to individuals who have [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=251.68s)]
*  been targeted for deportation. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=253.56s)]
*  And the numbers are, they should be [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=255.16000000000003s)]
*  terrifying for everybody, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=257.44s)]
*  including American citizens. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=259.08s)]
*  So as of June 14th, ICE had booked [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=261.16s)]
*  into detention 204,297 individuals [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=264.08000000000004s)]
*  since October 1st, 2024, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=267.44s)]
*  the start of fiscal year 2025. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=269.88000000000005s)]
*  Of those bookings, 65% or [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=272.76000000000005s)]
*  133,687 individuals had no [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=275.20000000000005s)]
*  criminal convictions. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=277.96000000000004s)]
*  So this idea that the majority of [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=280.64000000000004s)]
*  people who are being targeted have [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=282.52000000000004s)]
*  been convicted of serious crimes, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=284.36s)]
*  that's just a lie, okay? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=286.20000000000005s)]
*  Moreover, more than 93% of ICE [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=287.92s)]
*  bookings were never convicted of [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=290.52s)]
*  any violent offenses. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=293.52s)]
*  About nine in 10 had no convictions [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=296.15999999999997s)]
*  for violent or property offenses. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=298.59999999999997s)]
*  All right, now again, Cenk is [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=301.15999999999997s)]
*  correct to note that there is [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=303.4s)]

*  who don't care. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=307.84s)]
*  They just want mass deportations, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=309.59999999999997s)]
*  that is absolutely true. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=311.79999999999995s)]
*  But the independents, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=313.44s)]
*  the lifelong Democratic voters who [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=315.35999999999996s)]

*  election, did they want that? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=320.6s)]
*  No, so that honestly fragile [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=322.72s)]
*  coalition that Trump was able to [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=324.68s)]
*  build in order to win in 2024, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=326.68s)]
*  that's going to fall apart as these [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=328.84000000000003s)]
*  targeted disastrous raids that have [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=331.16s)]
*  ended up deporting all sorts of [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=333.56s)]
*  people who haven't actually [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=335.56s)]
*  committed any crimes. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=337.52s)]
*  That's really going to hurt [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=339.88s)]
*  the Republican brand and [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=341.16s)]

*  the Trump administration has shifted [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=345.36s)]
*  from criminals to any immigrant [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=347.36s)]
*  that they can find. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=349.28000000000003s)]
*  In early January, ICE was arresting [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=350.6s)]

*  the interior who had no criminal [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=355.04s)]
*  conviction or pending charge. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=357.16s)]
*  By early June, these arrests were [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=358.96000000000004s)]

*  a 14-fold increase. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=364.2s)]
*  And as the Wall Street Journal [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=366.56s)]
*  reported, this was all Stephen [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=368.16s)]

*  Stephen Miller met with ICE and [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=370.32s)]
*  basically said, listen, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=371.88s)]
*  your numbers are too low, so [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=373.12s)]

*  That was intentional, go to the home [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=376.28000000000003s)]
*  depot parking lots. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=378.08s)]

*  American citizens, because between [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=380.92s)]

*  ended up deporting 70. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=397.6s)]
*  Okay, other research suggests that [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=400.32s)]
*  that number of American citizens [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=402.56s)]
*  deported by ICE could be far [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=404.6s)]
*  higher. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=406.2s)]
*  Research by Jacqueline Stevens, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=406.96s)]
*  a political scientist at [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=408.72s)]
*  Northwestern University, shows that [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=409.88s)]
*  up to 1% of all detainees at [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=411.92s)]
*  immigration detention centers are [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=413.4s)]
*  US citizens. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=415.32s)]
*  If that 1% figure was constant [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=417.04s)]
*  throughout all deportations, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=419.2s)]
*  that would mean 4,000 US citizens [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=421.48s)]
*  a year are deported. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=423.88s)]
*  US citizens, I'm not talking about [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=425.76s)]
*  green card holders, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=427.48s)]

*  citizens getting deported. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=431.92s)]
*  So a quick point about this, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=433.68s)]
*  that's why you need due process. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=434.84000000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=436.40000000000003s)]
*  Because without due process, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=437.04s)]
*  then you're accidentally deporting [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=438.24s)]
*  US citizens, that's unacceptable to [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=439.8s)]
*  everyone. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=441.48s)]
*  So now, I've got to tell you about [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=442.56s)]
*  one other fact that's critical. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=444.12s)]
*  So Obama was known as [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=445.88s)]
*  the deporter in chief. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=447.08s)]
*  Why? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=448.40000000000003s)]
*  He deported more people than any [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=449.04s)]
*  other president. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=451.0s)]
*  In one year, he did about almost [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=451.96000000000004s)]
*  430,000 removals, right? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=454.2s)]
*  So why come Obama's policies [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=456.72s)]
*  weren't as inflammatory and [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=458.76s)]
*  controversial as Donald Trump? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=460.92s)]
*  Is part of it because the media [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=463.88s)]
*  treats Obama better than Trump? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=465.6s)]
*  Yes, a part of it is about that. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=467.64s)]
*  But there's also a real [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=469.76s)]
*  substantive reason. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=470.92s)]
*  Because Obama did two things. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=472.16s)]
*  He did secure cities so that [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=474.32s)]
*  whenever an undocumented immigrant [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=476.88s)]
*  was picked up for a crime and [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=480.16s)]
*  convicted, they were immediately [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=482.64s)]
*  removed, okay? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=485.52s)]
*  A lot of liberal cities got rid of [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=487.0s)]
*  that and made sanctuary cities. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=488.96s)]
*  So that is partly why the [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=491.44s)]
*  Democratic policies seem to shift. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=492.72s)]
*  And so we went away from secure [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=497.36s)]
*  cities, but that was working and [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=499.36s)]
*  it was popular and it was aimed at [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=501.52s)]
*  just getting rid of [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=503.64s)]
*  undocumented criminals, okay? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=504.92s)]
*  But the other thing that he did is [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=507.76s)]
*  he processed them at the border. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=509.2s)]
*  So instead of just returning them, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=511.2s)]
*  which Bill Clinton broke the record [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=513.2s)]
*  on removal and return, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=515.2s)]
*  both Democratic presidents, right? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=516.44s)]
*  Obama would process them so [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=518.84s)]
*  that if they returned, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=520.64s)]
*  they would be banned from [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=522.5600000000001s)]
*  the country for ten years. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=523.36s)]
*  If they were returned twice, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=524.44s)]
*  they'd be banned forever. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=525.6s)]
*  So that was an efficient way of [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=526.9200000000001s)]
*  returning folks, but [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=528.9200000000001s)]
*  going through a process to make [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=530.44s)]
*  sure that they didn't have a human [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=532.4000000000001s)]
*  rights claim and asylum claim. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=534.48s)]
*  So then you do the right thing in [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=536.1600000000001s)]
*  treating them legally, but [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=538.0s)]
*  you also return them quicker, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=539.6800000000001s)]
*  right? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=541.48s)]
*  So it's a win-win. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=542.24s)]
*  But what Obama didn't do, even as [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=543.84s)]
*  he was breaking records on removal, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=545.6800000000001s)]
*  was go in the middle of the country [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=547.8000000000001s)]
*  and uproot people who had been [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=549.6400000000001s)]
*  there for ten years, 20 years, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=551.32s)]
*  five years, etc., and [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=553.2800000000001s)]
*  separate out families. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=554.5600000000001s)]
*  That seems much more cruel, and [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=556.8000000000001s)]
*  I think it is more cruel. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=558.7600000000001s)]
*  And that is why people are [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=560.72s)]
*  objecting to this. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=561.9200000000001s)]
*  And by the way, the reason Stephen [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=563.0400000000001s)]
*  Miller is told them in early June, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=564.6s)]
*  you better get going is because [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=566.32s)]
*  it's really bothering them that [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=567.84s)]
*  Trump can't break Obama's record. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=569.48s)]
*  It's so pathetic. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=571.8000000000001s)]
*  It's just, it is. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=572.72s)]
*  It's so childish and ridiculous. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=573.6400000000001s)]
*  But now they're doing it in a way [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=575.6800000000001s)]
*  that is not popular and [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=577.1600000000001s)]
*  it's driving down their numbers on [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=578.32s)]
*  immigration. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=580.1600000000001s)]
*  He actually got to an unpopular [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=581.44s)]
*  number on immigration when Trump [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=582.92s)]
*  was sky high in the beginning when [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=584.5600000000001s)]
*  he was just sending away [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=586.24s)]
*  the criminals, right? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=587.5600000000001s)]
*  Or we thought the criminals and [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=589.64s)]
*  then you find out, of course, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=590.92s)]
*  he did a sloppy job as always, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=592.28s)]
*  didn't do his homework, and [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=593.72s)]
*  included a whole bunch of people. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=595.12s)]
*  In fact, the majority of people he [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=597.24s)]
*  shouldn't have sent. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=598.5600000000001s)]
*  I agree, yeah. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=599.48s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=600.32s)]
*  an angel gets his wings. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=601.96s)]
*  Totally not true, but [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=603.4s)]
*  it does keep you updated on [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OjB1U6Xm3A&t=604.44s)]
