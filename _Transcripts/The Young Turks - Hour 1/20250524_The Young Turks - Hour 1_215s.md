TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.

TYT‚Äôs 24/7 programming is available on YouTube TV, Samsung TV, Plus, Roku, Xumo, TCLtv+, Fubo, and more.

TYT is also available as a podcast on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, TuneIn, Amazon Music, and more.

# Cenk SPILLS THE TEA About His Time At MSNBC
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [May 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsyDWL8Bwi0)
*  So now let's go to the MSNBC stories. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsyDWL8Bwi0&t=0.0s)]
*  So my executive producer would say to me all the time when I criticize Democrats, Cenk, remember who the home team is? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsyDWL8Bwi0&t=3.84s)]
*  Okay, that's not that complicated, right? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsyDWL8Bwi0&t=12.0s)]
*  You know, you [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsyDWL8Bwi0&t=14.44s)]
*  It was obvious what he was referring to. Okay, and you guys have heard me tell the story before about how they said, you know [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsyDWL8Bwi0&t=16.0s)]
*  We're insiders and you got to act like it Washington's not happy with your tone, right? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsyDWL8Bwi0&t=21.66s)]
*  There's longer versions of that story if you want in the member section [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsyDWL8Bwi0&t=26.279999999999998s)]
*  so [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsyDWL8Bwi0&t=30.72s)]
*  but the story that some of you might not have heard is [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsyDWL8Bwi0&t=31.96s)]
*  When I was covering Obama's press conference on the Egyptian Revolution [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsyDWL8Bwi0&t=36.72s)]
*  I wanted to criticize him because he said that we were really in favor of our wonderful ally Hosni Mubarak [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsyDWL8Bwi0&t=40.8s)]
*  And he was really encouraged by the revolution [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsyDWL8Bwi0&t=48.0s)]
*  Against Hosni Mubarak. Okay, it was classic Obama talking out of both sides of his mouth [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsyDWL8Bwi0&t=50.599999999999994s)]
*  And go back and watch that press conference. It's hilarious [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsyDWL8Bwi0&t=55.28s)]
*  Okay [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsyDWL8Bwi0&t=57.96s)]
*  So I was gonna say that on air and I did say it on there and I got my producer in my ear saying don't don't [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsyDWL8Bwi0&t=58.6s)]
*  Don't say it right and then afterwards we have the extra comical part where they say well Cenk [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsyDWL8Bwi0&t=64.2s)]
*  No, the reason we told you not to criticize him is because it's disrespectful the president to criticize him right after a press conference [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsyDWL8Bwi0&t=70.52s)]
*  Like you know, we're in the news business, right and then I so now since I'm [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsyDWL8Bwi0&t=79.44s)]
*  Who I am and this is what causes me trouble [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsyDWL8Bwi0&t=85.4s)]
*  And I said, okay, this is a fun game. So how long do I have to wait before criticizing him? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsyDWL8Bwi0&t=89.0s)]
*  And I said is it an hour? Is it a day? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsyDWL8Bwi0&t=95.2s)]
*  Is it two days and then we went back and forth having this hilarious conversation until they landed on a week [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsyDWL8Bwi0&t=99.64s)]
*  In other words until it's completely and utterly out of the news and then they'll say Cenk [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsyDWL8Bwi0&t=108.36s)]
*  What do you bring back that old news for right a [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsyDWL8Bwi0&t=112.82000000000001s)]
*  Week really we're gonna wait a week before we criticize any president [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsyDWL8Bwi0&t=115.74s)]
*  Well to be fair you see them waiting a week before they criticize Trump on anything [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsyDWL8Bwi0&t=120.38s)]
*  Joke it's a joke. It's just propaganda for corporate Democrats. Now. I stopped listening to their advice in April. Why? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsyDWL8Bwi0&t=125.98s)]
*  Well, this is the TV moment or movie moment. I got pulled in and [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsyDWL8Bwi0&t=134.54s)]
*  And they told me [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsyDWL8Bwi0&t=140.61999999999998s)]
*  Hey, listen, we were just or it was actually one specific person that had a SMBC [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsyDWL8Bwi0&t=142.82s)]
*  He said I was just in Washington and people in Washington tell me that they're concerned about your tone [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsyDWL8Bwi0&t=148.01999999999998s)]
*  And then he gives me the second part of the speech. Hey, listen, Jake [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsyDWL8Bwi0&t=154.1s)]
*  Outsiders are cool [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsyDWL8Bwi0&t=159.01999999999998s)]
*  And they wear I think he might have said something like they wear leather jackets. They're what ride bikes. I think I'm an outsider [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsyDWL8Bwi0&t=160.45999999999998s)]
*  Don't ride bike, but I have a terrible leather jacket anyway [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsyDWL8Bwi0&t=165.7s)]
*  He said I'd love to be an outsider outsiders are cool, but we're not we're insiders [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsyDWL8Bwi0&t=169.78s)]
*  We are the established the problem with the mainstream media is they're desperate to get access [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsyDWL8Bwi0&t=175.45999999999998s)]
*  They don't challenge the government [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsyDWL8Bwi0&t=180.54s)]
*  They don't challenge power and now you see that that is in fact true when they give you the speech [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsyDWL8Bwi0&t=182.22s)]
*  You're not sure that it's true when they act upon the speech then you're sure it's true [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsyDWL8Bwi0&t=187.1s)]
*  Then I got to tell you that if I take the money and I get a reduced role and I just you know [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsyDWL8Bwi0&t=190.82s)]
*  Do whatever I do with it. Maybe I even rise up in the ranks again [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsyDWL8Bwi0&t=195.58s)]
*  What's the point man? The point of this show was truth-telling [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsyDWL8Bwi0&t=199.06s)]
*  That's what we're supposed to do. We're supposed to challenge the government. That's the role of the media [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsyDWL8Bwi0&t=202.86s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below an angel gets a swing totally not true, but it does keep you updated on our live shows [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsyDWL8Bwi0&t=207.9s)]
