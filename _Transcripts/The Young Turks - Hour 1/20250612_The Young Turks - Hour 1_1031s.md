"U.S. officials have been told Israel is fully ready to launch an operation into Iran, multiple sources told CBS News. 
The U.S. anticipates Iran could retaliate on certain American sites in neighboring Iraq. This is part of the reason the U.S. advised some Americans to leave the region earlier Wednesday. The State Department ordered non-emergency government officials to exit Iraq due to "heightened regional tensions," and the Pentagon has authorized military family members to voluntarily leave locations throughout the Middle East, a defense official told CBS News."

# Israel Plans To Strike Iran, Forcing U.S. To Prepare For A DISASTROUS War
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA)
*  The US and Iran are set to have more nuclear talks on Sunday. President Trump confirms [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=0.0s)]
*  the US is removing some diplomats and their families from parts of the Middle East [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=4.48s)]
*  because of escalating tensions between Israel and Iran. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=8.32s)]
*  How imminent is the Israeli strike on Iran? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=11.6s)]
*  Well, I don't wanna say imminent, but it looks like it's something that could very well happen. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=15.52s)]
*  Just as the United States was set to hold yet another round of diplomatic talks with Iran [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  in the hope of signing a new nuclear deal considering Trump ripped up the one from 2018. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=28.56s)]
*  Israel is now threatening to strike Iran and drag the United States in yet another [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=34.64s)]
*  regime change war in the Middle East. Here's more. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=41.2s)]
*  Reports say Israel is prepared to launch an attack on Iran with or without US support. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=44.56s)]
*  We're trying to make a deal so that there's no destruction and death. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=51.2s)]
*  And we've told them that and I've told them that and I hope that's the way it works out, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=58.160000000000004s)]
*  but it might not work out that way. Trump previously warned Israeli [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=61.68s)]
*  President Benjamin Netanyahu against any military action while negotiations with Iran are still [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=65.36s)]
*  ongoing. Now, obviously, the President of the United States would warn Israel against conducting [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=70.32s)]
*  strikes against Iran as the US is engaged in diplomatic talks with Iran. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=79.28s)]
*  But see, that's the problem. Israel doesn't want the United States to engage in diplomatic talks. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=84.64s)]
*  Israel doesn't want the United States to secure a nuclear deal because a nuclear deal would kind of [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=91.04s)]
*  eliminate the justification for Israel to drag the United States into a hot war with Iran. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=97.92s)]
*  And of course, the real objective here for Israel is to get the United States to engage [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=105.44s)]
*  in a regime change war. So at the end of the day, the most powerful country, well, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=111.03999999999999s)]
*  the most powerful country in that region is already Israel. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=116.32s)]
*  But Israel is constantly worried that there might be some retaliation for their bad behavior [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=119.36s)]
*  by Iran. So they want to ensure that Iran does not obtain a nuclear weapon. But don't make the [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=125.75999999999999s)]
*  mistake of thinking they're gonna stop there. They do want regime change in Iran, but more [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=130.48s)]
*  importantly, they want to essentially drag the United States to fight that war on their behalf. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=134.8s)]
*  You wanna know why? Because they literally would not be able to win that war without the assistance, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=140.72s)]
*  without the aid of the United States. Now, before I move on any further, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=146.0s)]
*  just minutes before we went live today, President Donald Trump posted something on social media in [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=151.52s)]
*  regard to this issue, arguing that he will remain committed to a diplomatic resolution [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=156.72000000000003s)]
*  to the Iran nuclear issue. My entire administration has been directed to negotiate [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=162.88s)]
*  with Iran. They could be a great country, but they first must completely give up hopes of [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=167.76s)]
*  obtaining a nuclear weapon. Thank you for your attention to this matter. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=174.07999999999998s)]
*  He didn't write that, but nonetheless, if he actually agrees with that sentiment, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=179.04s)]
*  then I'm all for it. And Iran is in the negotiations, the diplomatic talks are not [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=183.2s)]
*  about whether Iran gets to develop a nuclear weapon or not. Iran has already agreed that they [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=192.16s)]
*  are willing to not develop a nuclear weapon, to avoid developing a nuclear weapon. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=198.0s)]
*  The real sticking point here is whether Iran will be allowed to enrich civilian levels of uranium, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=203.76s)]
*  meaning uranium that will be used to provide energy power to their people, because they [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=212.0s)]
*  export their oil. That is what props up their economy. And so in order to provide energy to [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=218.48s)]
*  their people, they like to use nuclear power, which by the way, something we should consider [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=223.76s)]
*  leaning into a little more here in the United States if we really give a damn about the climate [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=228.64s)]
*  emergency, but that's a different story. So look, the Trump administration ordered military and [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=232.32s)]
*  diplomatic personnel to basically leave the region, leave Middle East countries that we [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=240.32s)]
*  have bases in, in order to prevent a retaliatory strike against them by Iran following Israel's [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=247.35999999999999s)]
*  offensive actions. So Israel claims that it would be justified in striking Iran due to Iran's [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=255.35999999999999s)]
*  enrichment of uranium, which theoretically can be used to build a nuclear weapon. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=260.8s)]
*  And get a load of this, on Thursday, the International Atomic Energy Agency declared [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=266.4s)]
*  that Iran was not complying with its nuclear nonproliferation obligations. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=270.79999999999995s)]
*  The first such censure in two decades, Iran condemned the vote saying it completely called [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=276.23999999999995s)]
*  into question the credibility and prestige of the nuclear watchdog. Now, you should know that [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=281.84s)]
*  Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency, what they were up to, where they were traversing recently, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=289.44000000000005s)]
*  and who they were having conversations with. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=298.40000000000003s)]
*  In fact, why don't we hear from reporter Murtaza Hussein. He works for DropSite News and he [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=300.32000000000005s)]
*  explains exactly what I'm talking about. The Omani foreign minister confirmed that talks [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=307.44000000000005s)]
*  will happen between Steve Witkoff and between Iran's foreign minister. However, Moss, at the [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=314.24s)]
*  same time, we do know that Israel's head of Mossad and their minister, Ron Dermer, will be meeting [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=320.0s)]
*  with Steve Witkoff, apparently ahead of said meeting, again, potentially for some coordination [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=326.48s)]
*  of what exactly we don't know. Iran just got rebuked this morning by the IAEA over nuclear [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=331.44000000000005s)]
*  materials. So things do seem to be trending in a very bad direction, unless things go well during [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=337.68s)]
*  these talks. This is a problem too that Mossad officials and Ron Dermer have been hovering [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=343.12s)]
*  around the talks from the beginning. They've been in Rome, they've been wherever the talks [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=349.36s)]
*  are happening. They're either briefing with Kauf beforehand or just being in the area to let them [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=353.28000000000003s)]
*  know that their position is very, very important in these talks. So to be honest, I'm not particularly [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=357.52s)]
*  optimistic, unfortunately, about the Sunday talks or the talks this weekend. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=363.44s)]
*  It also doesn't help that legacy media also seems complicit at best or pounding the war drums at [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=366.64s)]
*  worst, just as they did in the lead up to our invasion of Iraq. So I'm gonna give you a quick [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=375.03999999999996s)]
*  excerpt from the New York Times. There's a bit of information here that's actually accurate and [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=380.47999999999996s)]
*  really, really important, especially as it pertains to what the IAEA is claiming. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=384.71999999999997s)]
*  But just notice the vague citation here. It's very reminiscent of what I would read in the [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=390.64s)]
*  lead up to our invasion of Iraq. Iran's nuclear program has advanced considerably over the past [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=397.04s)]
*  decade, analysts say. It is now on the brink of being able to manufacture enough nuclear material [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=403.28s)]
*  to fuel 10 nuclear weapons, although producing a usable bomb would likely take many more months. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=410.08s)]
*  Who exactly are these analysts? Who are these analysts? Are these analysts, I don't know, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=418.16s)]
*  tied to defense contractors, weapons manufacturers, the Israel lobby? I don't know who are these [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=426.48s)]
*  analysts. But more importantly, let's not forget the most important part of that entire statement [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=434.0s)]
*  or excerpt from the New York Times that I just read. Because producing a usable bomb would likely [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=440.64000000000004s)]
*  take many more months. And honestly, I'm suspicious of even that claim. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=447.12s)]
*  I don't think that Iran is about to develop a nuclear weapon and wipe out the United States. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=453.28000000000003s)]
*  I think that Israel sees Iran as a threat. Israel wants Iran's regime changed. They know that they [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=459.2s)]
*  can't fight that war and win on their own, and they're gonna drag us into it. And the fact that [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=467.04s)]
*  there's currently an effort to manufacture consent for this drives me absolutely insane. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=471.12s)]
*  So let's get to the rest of this. Israel wants war, Netanyahu in particular, has been beating [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=477.2s)]
*  the war drums for years, for decades, as it pertains to Iran. I can show you evidence dating [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=482.8s)]
*  back to the 1990s. In fact, why don't I do that right now? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=489.92s)]
*  Now. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=493.12s)]
*  The most dangerous of these regimes is Iran that has wed a cruel despotism [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=493.6s)]
*  to a fanatic militancy. If this regime or its despotic neighbor, Iraq, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=500.64s)]
*  were to acquire nuclear weapons, this could presage catastrophic consequences, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=508.24s)]
*  not only for my country and not only for the Middle East, but for all of mankind. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=515.68s)]
*  The two nations that are vying competing with each other, who will be the first to achieve [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=521.36s)]
*  nuclear weapons, is Iraq and Iran. And Iran, by the way, is also outpacing Iraq in the development [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=524.96s)]
*  of ballistic missile systems that they hope will reach the Eastern seaboard of the United States. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=532.4s)]
*  They have to enrich enough high enriched uranium for the first bomb. Where's Iran? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=537.12s)]
*  Iran's completed the first stage. It took them many years, but they completed it, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=544.32s)]
*  and they're 70% of the way there. Now they're well into the second stage. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=553.12s)]
*  And by next spring, at most, by next summer, at current enrichment rates, they will have finished [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=559.6s)]
*  the medium enrichment and move on to the final stage. From there, it's only a few months, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=567.28s)]
*  possibly a few weeks. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=573.68s)]
*  ‚Äî That last clip in the compilation you just watched was from 2012. Back in 2012, Benjamin [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=575.64s)]
*  Netanyahu was claiming that Iran was months away, maybe weeks away, maybe weeks away, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=582.2399999999999s)]
*  of having a nuclear weapon. Now currently, Israel has nuclear weapons, which they refuse to [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=588.4s)]
*  acknowledge, but the entire international community knows they have nuclear weapons. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=595.52s)]
*  They began their nuclear program in the 1960s. And there's only one country in the Middle East [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=599.28s)]
*  right now that's carrying out a genocide, and that country is the country of Israel. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=605.1999999999999s)]
*  So if we're concerned about a questionable government in the Middle East obtaining nuclear [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=609.4399999999999s)]
*  weapons or having nuclear weapons, maybe we should have a discussion about the genocidal regime that's [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=614.9599999999999s)]
*  carrying out genocide in Gaza right now. The regime that just called for the complete annexation [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=619.76s)]
*  of the West Bank and the construction of 22 additional illegal settlements. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=626.88s)]
*  Maybe we should have a conversation about the country that has a military force, the IDF, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=632.4s)]
*  that literally shot at European and international diplomats as they were visiting Janine last month. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=637.92s)]
*  Can we have a conversation about that? And if Netanyahu was so concerned with Iran's [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=644.96s)]
*  enrichment of uranium, why did he lobby so hard to get Donald Trump to pull out of the Iran nuclear [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=655.28s)]
*  deal that was signed by Iran, our allies, and of course the United States back in 2015. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=663.36s)]
*  But of course, Trump pulled out of it in 2018 on behalf of Israel. Why? I mean, let's take a look [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=670.4s)]
*  at this graph because it shows you Iran's uranium enrichment program. And if you notice, as soon as [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=675.9200000000001s)]
*  the nuclear deal is signed, that activity comes to a stop. They enrich just enough uranium [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=684.08s)]
*  specifically to provide energy to their own people. But it wasn't until 2018 when Trump [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=691.2800000000001s)]
*  ripped that deal up that Iran began enriching uranium again at higher levels. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=697.12s)]
*  Because that wasn't the bug, that was the feature of pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal for Netanyahu. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=705.6s)]
*  Because he's been itching for this war. He's been itching for those US tax dollars, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=712.32s)]
*  those American bombs, boots on the ground in Iran, American boots on the ground in Iran. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=717.44s)]
*  Why do you think Trump had to evacuate American military personnel from our bases in the Middle [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=724.6400000000001s)]
*  East? Why do you think? It's because Israel's actions, if they do carry out strikes in Iran, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=731.7600000000001s)]
*  put Americans at danger, Americans. And at the same time, you'll hear the war hawk Israelis [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=739.6s)]
*  within the Israeli government argue, no, no, we're worried about the national security of Americans. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=748.64s)]
*  No, you're not. They're not worried about the national security of Americans at all. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=754.64s)]
*  After Netanyahu succeeded in convincing Trump to do this, you see the nuclear, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=759.36s)]
*  I'm sorry, the uranium enrichment that Netanyahu is currently acknowledging that Iran and its [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=764.3199999999999s)]
*  proxies have been severely weakened due to Israel's ongoing attacks over the last year and a half. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=770.9599999999999s)]
*  So he will acknowledge that they're weakened and they're less of a threat. But nonetheless, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=776.2399999999999s)]
*  Iran has been weakened since Hamas launched the October 7th, 2023 attack on Israel that ignited [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=781.3599999999999s)]
*  the war in Gaza. Hamas and Hezbollah, which are backed by Iran, have been decimated in their [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=786.88s)]
*  wars with Israel. And you would think that that would convince Netanyahu to calm down a little [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=793.92s)]
*  bit, but no, war is the only answer for Bibi. Netanyahu has privately argued that Iran's [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=798.24s)]
*  vulnerability will not last long, meaning that Israel has a limited window in which to launch [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=804.72s)]
*  an attack. He just wants war. Doesn't matter if Trump is trying to pursue diplomatic means. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=811.28s)]
*  This guy, Netanyahu, his government, they want war, they wanna drag us into it. It's just so [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=817.6s)]
*  obvious and so clear. And by the way, the New York Times decided to keep citing the ominous [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=822.9599999999999s)]
*  analysts in their piece, writing that Israeli strikes against Iran's air defenses last year [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=828.4s)]
*  weakened their capabilities, allowing Israeli fighter jets to more safely launch a new mass [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=833.1999999999999s)]
*  attack, according to officials and analysts. If Israel waits too long, Iran might restore them, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=838.56s)]
*  analysts said. Who are the analysts? Is there a possibility that the analysts have a conflict [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=845.76s)]
*  of interest here that we should know about, but we can't look up because they're not being named? [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=852.64s)]
*  What a pathetic report. But look, things do not look good when you have Donald Trump downplaying [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=857.52s)]
*  the prospects of a deal with Iran. Now, he said this on camera prior to posting that [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=864.4s)]
*  we still favor diplomacy post on social media. But nonetheless, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=871.6s)]
*  this doesn't really inspire much confidence in the Trump administration. Take a look. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=876.0s)]
*  And what's the main impediment to getting a deal? [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=879.84s)]
*  Well, they're just asking for things that you can't do. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=884.0799999999999s)]
*  They don't wanna give up what they have to give up. You know what that is? [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=888.56s)]
*  They seek enrichment. We can't have enrichment. We want just the opposite. And so far, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=892.1600000000001s)]
*  they're not there. I hate to say that because the alternative is a very, very dire one, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=900.72s)]
*  but they're not there. They have given us their thoughts on the deal. And I said, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=908.5600000000001s)]
*  it's just not acceptable. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=914.96s)]
*  Do you think you're gonna be able to stop Iran from enriching its- [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=916.4000000000001s)]
*  I don't know. I did think so. And I'm getting more and more less confident about it. They seem to be [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=921.36s)]
*  delaying it. I think that's a shame. But I'm less confident now than I would have been [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=930.0s)]
*  a couple of months ago. If they don't make a deal, they're not gonna have a nuclear weapon. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=935.12s)]
*  It would be nicer to do it without warfare, without people dying. There's so much nicer to do it. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=939.6s)]
*  So it would be more than just nice to avoid a hot war with Iran. Because if Trump decides that he [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=947.0400000000001s)]
*  is gonna be dog walked to the extent that Israel pushes the United States into a conflict, into a [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=954.08s)]
*  war with Iran, a lot of people are gonna die. We would need boots on the ground to fight Iran. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=960.96s)]
*  I mean, just think of it. The United States with all of its funding, all of its weaponry, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=966.32s)]
*  couldn't even beat the Houthis in Yemen, who are Iran backed. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=971.52s)]
*  So obviously, if war breaks out with Iran, we would need to have boots on the ground. And [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=977.12s)]
*  Iran is nothing like Iraq. We're talking about far bigger landmass, far bigger landmass. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=982.48s)]
*  We're talking about 90 million people in Iran. We're talking about superior weaponry compared [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=988.96s)]
*  to what Iraq had. It would be a complete and utter disaster, complete and utter carnage of [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=994.3199999999999s)]
*  innocent civilians, American soldiers. And for what? Because the current Israeli government [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=1000.72s)]
*  doesn't seek diplomatic means of ending Iran's nuclear program. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=1008.64s)]
*  It's ridiculous, but that's where we are. We'll see what happens. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=1015.52s)]
*  But for the love of God, please, someone keep that pig Mark Levin away from Trump. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=1019.2s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below, an angel gets a swings. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=1023.9200000000001s)]
*  Totally not true, but it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7nv_aZ6BRA&t=1027.1200000000001s)]
