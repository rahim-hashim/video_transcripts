"A Project on Government Oversight (POGO) analysis of disclosures from several administration  figures found that Miller and at least 11 other White House officials and staffers own stock in Palantir, including Gregory Barbaccia, Trump‚Äôs Chief Information Officer. 
Miller‚Äôs stake is tucked away in a brokerage account for one of his three young children, all of which are under the age of six. The single degree of separation is still a potential violation of ethics laws."

TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.
The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.
On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.
Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.
Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.
TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful.

We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

# Stephen Miller's DISTURBING Conflict Of Interest Unveiled
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY)
*  the police. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=0.0s)]
*  Do you think we should focus on [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=1.0s)]
*  criminals or all these people who [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=2.56s)]
*  are here illegally? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=4.44s)]
*  We should start focusing on [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  criminals, and that's what we've [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=6.84s)]
*  been focused on. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=8.58s)]
*  Very bad criminals, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=9.6s)]
*  dangerous criminals. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=10.72s)]
*  But Stephen Miller said to go out [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=11.88s)]
*  and arrest every person who's here [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=13.4s)]
*  illegally, he's told ICE to arrest [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  everyone who's here illegally. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=16.56s)]
*  We, Stephen and [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=17.96s)]
*  I have a very good understanding. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=18.96s)]
*  He's a terrific person, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=20.96s)]
*  we have a great understanding. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=22.12s)]
*  Stephen Miller, definitely not [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=23.64s)]
*  a terrific person. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=25.76s)]
*  And now, reporting in [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=27.2s)]
*  indicates that based on his [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=28.36s)]
*  financial disclosures, he might [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=30.12s)]
*  have some pretty significant [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=32.28s)]
*  conflicts of interest as it [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=34.12s)]
*  pertains to his personal [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=36.04s)]
*  investments and what he's currently [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=37.84s)]
*  doing as part of the Trump [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=40.56s)]
*  administration. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=42.36s)]
*  So, as we all know, and thanks to [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=44.04s)]
*  the Wall Street Journal doing some [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=45.84s)]
*  excellent reporting on this, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=47.8s)]
*  these ICE raids have really ramped [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=49.72s)]
*  up beginning in early June. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=51.72s)]
*  And part of the reason why is [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  because Stephen Miller specifically [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=55.2s)]
*  said, listen, you guys are not [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=58.2s)]
*  meeting the numbers that we want. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=60.0s)]
*  So we want you to go for [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=61.88s)]
*  the long hanging fruit. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=62.88s)]
*  We want you to go to Home Depot [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=63.92s)]
*  parking lots, find the day laborers. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=65.64s)]
*  They tend to be undocumented, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=68.4s)]
*  round them up, arrest them. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=69.96000000000001s)]
*  We're going to deport them, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=71.60000000000001s)]
*  we want to increase our numbers. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=72.84s)]
*  Well now, it turns out that it [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=74.48s)]
*  might not just be about Trump [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=76.4s)]
*  wanting to beat Obama's deportation [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=78.4s)]
*  numbers, Obama, the deporter in [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=81.04s)]
*  chief as he was called. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=83.36s)]
*  And to be fair, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=85.24000000000001s)]
*  he's definitely very competitive [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=86.36s)]
*  and wants to beat Obama's numbers. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=88.6s)]
*  I don't deny that at all. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=91.03999999999999s)]
*  But for Stephen Miller, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=92.67999999999999s)]
*  there's something personal and [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=93.96s)]
*  financial involved as well. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=95.63999999999999s)]
*  And that has to do with his [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=97.16s)]
*  investment in Palantir, which is [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=98.96s)]
*  very, very much involved in our [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=101.36s)]
*  deportation schemes here in [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=103.63999999999999s)]
*  the United States. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=105.8s)]
*  So according to Ethics Disclosure [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=107.56s)]
*  Reports released by the White House, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=110.24s)]
*  $100,000 and $250,000 worth of [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=113.48s)]
*  stock in Palantir, which of course [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=116.24s)]
*  is Peter Thiel's data and [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=119.08s)]
*  intelligence software company that [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=121.12s)]
*  has several lucrative contracts [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=123.84s)]
*  with immigration and [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=126.32s)]
*  customs enforcement to track data [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=127.96s)]
*  and conduct surveillance on [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=130.52s)]
*  undocumented immigrants and [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=132.76s)]
*  soon American citizens. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=135.04s)]
*  We'll continue covering that as [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=137.28s)]
*  that story develops. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=138.92s)]
*  But nonetheless, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=140.12s)]
*  Miller isn't the only one in [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=141.36s)]
*  the company that has [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=143.52s)]
*  a lot of money or [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=145.07999999999998s)]
*  stock in the company. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=146.07999999999998s)]
*  But he does have the largest stake. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=147.79999999999998s)]
*  Miller's investment could pose [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=150.24s)]
*  a severe conflict of interest, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=151.92s)]
*  obviously, especially since [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=153.76s)]
*  Palantir has had close ties to ICE. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=155.8s)]
*  By the way, dating as far back as [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=159.12s)]
*  the Obama administration. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=160.96s)]
*  And I'm not doing this [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=162.88s)]
*  both sides thing, but we also have [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=164.07999999999998s)]
*  to be real about the Democrats. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=165.96s)]
*  Because the Democrats, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=167.92s)]
*  they're different from [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=169.72s)]
*  the Democrats in that they don't [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=171.32s)]
*  make a big show of the deportations [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=173.2s)]
*  that they engage in. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=175.4s)]
*  But I went back and read stories [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=176.8s)]
*  from the Obama administration about [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=178.68s)]
*  how he had no problem separating [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=181.08s)]
*  families. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=183.24s)]
*  If the children were born here in [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=183.96s)]
*  the US, they could stay here, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=186.12s)]
*  because obviously they're citizens. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=188.04s)]
*  But he would deport the parents all [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=190.96s)]
*  the time. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=192.76s)]
*  And it's amazing to me that [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=193.36s)]
*  the same Democrats who obviously [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=195.2s)]
*  are pointing to the cruelty that [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=197.36s)]
*  we're seeing on the streets right [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=199.35999999999999s)]
*  now with these ICE raids, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=201.4s)]
*  they totally gave Obama a pass. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=202.95999999999998s)]
*  They didn't freak out about what [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=204.95999999999998s)]
*  Obama was doing. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=206.6s)]
*  So we need to hold government [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=207.56s)]
*  officials, politicians, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=209.12s)]
*  presidents accountable regardless [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=210.57999999999998s)]
*  of their party. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=212.68s)]
*  Otherwise, you're just a [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=213.64s)]
*  hypocritical person, okay? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=215.64s)]
*  Now with that in mind, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=218.76s)]
*  let me give you some more on what [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=220.04s)]
*  we've learned about Stephen Miller's [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=221.84s)]
*  financial disclosures. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=223.92s)]
*  So Palantir, I should note, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=225.68s)]
*  received a $41 million government [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=227.76s)]
*  contract back in 2014. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=230.48s)]
*  This is during the Obama [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=232.56s)]
*  administration and created custom [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=234.14s)]

*  Now deportations have escalated [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=241.4s)]
*  pretty quickly following Miller's [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=243.72s)]
*  directive to ICE officials in early [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=246.24s)]
*  June. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=248.72s)]
*  But months earlier in April, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=249.44s)]
*  this is super important. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=251.36s)]
*  So just months earlier, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=253.4s)]
*  ICE awarded Palantir another 30 [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=255.12s)]
*  million dollar contract to create [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=257.64s)]
*  tracking software aimed at [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=259.91999999999996s)]
*  providing the agency with near [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=261.84s)]
*  real time visibility into migrants [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=264.12s)]
*  engaging in self deportation. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=266.7s)]
*  According to documents obtained by [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=269.03999999999996s)]
*  Wired, one of the core functions of [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=271.64s)]
*  the program dubbed Immigration OS, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=274.32s)]
*  very creative, would be to [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=277.12s)]
*  streamline and prioritize selection [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=278.96s)]
*  and apprehension operations of [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=281.67999999999995s)]
*  illegal aliens. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=283.96s)]
*  And I'm reading that verbatim. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=285.28s)]
*  So Reuters reports that this is [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=287.56s)]
*  the largest single federal contract [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=289.72s)]
*  that Palantir has been able to [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=292.32s)]
*  secure from a federal government [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=294.32s)]
*  agency, in this case ICE. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=296.52s)]
*  And Don Fox, who's the former [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=298.64s)]

*  And if Palantir is going to be [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=326.23999999999995s)]
*  the beneficiary, well, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=327.79999999999995s)]
*  the value of your shares are going [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=329.12s)]
*  to increase. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=330.91999999999996s)]
*  This is why having government [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=332.2s)]
*  officials, whether we're talking [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=333.84s)]

*  any presidential cabinet, investing [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=338.82s)]

*  a problem, because it does create [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=342.2s)]
*  a conflict of interest. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=343.82s)]
*  Now look, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=345.52s)]
*  Stephen Miller absolutely hates [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=346.2s)]
*  immigrants, he doesn't hide it. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=348.24s)]
*  I think he would do what he's doing [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=350.59999999999997s)]
*  right now, regardless of his [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=352.47999999999996s)]
*  investments in Palantir. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=354.2s)]
*  So I don't want to give him some [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=356.02s)]
*  sort of weird pass by saying, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=357.82s)]
*  his heart's not into it, but [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=359.76s)]
*  he's thinking about his pocketbook. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=361.44s)]
*  So he's going to push for [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=363.28s)]
*  this terrible, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=364.91999999999996s)]
*  cruel immigration policy simply [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=366.12s)]
*  because he wants to make money. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=368.24s)]
*  No, I think in this case, yeah, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=370.0s)]
*  of course he wants to make money. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=371.62s)]
*  But he also gets to carry out [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=373.52s)]
*  the types of, in my opinion, cruel, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=375.52000000000004s)]
*  disgusting policies that are [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=377.84000000000003s)]

*  there's widespread support for [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=386.20000000000005s)]

*  voters. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=390.52000000000004s)]
*  But what we're really talking about [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=391.24s)]
*  here in terms of Trump losing [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=393.32000000000005s)]
*  favorability on immigration, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=394.98s)]

*  fed up with Democrats. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=407.56s)]
*  They decided to switch parties and [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=409.04s)]

*  now. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=466.71999999999997s)]

*  swing all the way to what Stephen [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=485.96s)]
*  Miller is now pushing ICE to do. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=487.84s)]
*  Now, I should say that Miller's [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=490.08s)]
*  investments have definitely paid [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=492.32s)]
*  off quite a bit. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=494.96s)]
*  So Palantir Technologies has been [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=496.92s)]
*  the top performing S&P 500 index [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=499.44s)]

*  you've got a pretty scummy guy [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=517.72s)]
*  who's targeted immigrants forever [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZW-TfMniY&t=519.4399999999999s)]
