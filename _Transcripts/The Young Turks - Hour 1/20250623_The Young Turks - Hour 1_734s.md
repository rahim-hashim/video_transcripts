"Florida Republican Rep. Kat Cammack has revealed that she almost died last year as a result of her state‚Äôs six-week abortion ban, which left hospital staff reluctant to treat her ectopic pregnancy for fear of criminal prosecution.
Speaking to The Wall Street Journal, Cammack, 37, reported her experiences in an unnamed Florida hospital‚Äôs emergency room on May 31 2024 when it was discovered that there was no way for her baby‚Äôs embryo to survive and that her own life was in danger without action."

# Republican Rep. BLAMES THE LEFT After She Can't Get An Abortion
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s)
*  Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signing a bill that would ban most abortions after six weeks. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=0.0s)]
*  DeSantis quietly signing the law just after 11 PM, posting only this photo on Twitter. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=5.78s)]
*  It's very, very scary that we have someone who is a contender for commander in chief, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=11.88s)]
*  who is not willing to take a stand for women, for the health of women. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=16.36s)]
*  As we all know, abortion is not healthcare. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=21.1s)]
*  And unrestricted abortion is very, very dangerous. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=23.28s)]
*  Well, the congresswoman you just heard from, Kat Kamik, needed an abortion. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=28.52s)]
*  Oops. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=34.2s)]
*  In the state of Florida, where they've effectively banned abortion. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=35.239999999999995s)]
*  Now, the abortion ban takes effect after six weeks of conception. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=39.16s)]
*  And in this case, she had an ectopic pregnancy that put her life in danger. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=44.519999999999996s)]
*  And so she goes to the hospital, they realize she has that ectopic pregnancy. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=50.84s)]
*  There's no heartbeat, this is not a viable pregnancy, and her life is in danger. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=55.72s)]
*  But the abortion ban makes things real complicated in the great state of Florida. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=61.24s)]
*  So let's give you the details. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=66.04s)]
*  Now, at one point she had two options, okay? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=67.60000000000001s)]
*  The first option was to undergo the surgery to remove the embryo, but [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=70.4s)]
*  risk losing her uterus, or get a shot of, it's called methotrexate, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=74.84s)]
*  which blocks the flow of folic acid to the embryo. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=81.56s)]
*  She opted for the shot, but doctors were scared to give it to her, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=85.4s)]
*  because they were worried about the legal repercussions. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=89.08s)]
*  They were worried about potentially being prosecuted for carrying this out. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=92.28s)]
*  Now, the ban went into effect, by the way, in May of 2024. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=97.6s)]
*  And again, made abortions illegal after six weeks with some limited exceptions. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=102.56s)]
*  Abortion for ectopic pregnancies were not banned, but [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=108.12s)]
*  this whole thing is complicated. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=111.76s)]
*  Because when doctors know that they could face prosecution for [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=113.72s)]
*  carrying out an abortion, and [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=118.0s)]
*  when certain terms aren't well defined in the legislation, well, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=120.08s)]
*  they're just going to be super cautious and [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=124.12s)]
*  avoid treating someone who needs this treatment. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=126.6s)]
*  So concern about the laws wording made doctors hesitant. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=129.92s)]
*  Kamek said doctors and nurses who saw her said they were worried about losing [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=133.64s)]
*  their licenses or going to jail if they gave her drugs to end the pregnancy. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=138.0s)]
*  And even though she was pleading her case, the staff resisted, she said. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=144.12s)]
*  Even though doctors earlier that day estimated that she was just five weeks [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=147.64000000000001s)]
*  pregnant, there was no heartbeat and her life was at risk. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=151.60000000000002s)]
*  She pulled up the state law on her phone for hospital workers to read. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=155.88s)]
*  She said she called the governor's office late at night for help, but [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=160.52s)]
*  no one picked up. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=164.44s)]
*  Good. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=165.48s)]
*  Now after much argument and convincing, doctors finally agreed to give her [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=166.6s)]
*  the medication that she wanted in order to end this ectopic pregnancy. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=171.76s)]
*  But again, she didn't attack the abortion laws in the state. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=177.04s)]
*  She didn't attack the right wing or [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=184.24s)]
*  Republicans in the state for passing an effective abortion ban. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=186.24s)]
*  Cenk, she decided to attack Democrats. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=190.28s)]
*  Of course, because logic not required. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=192.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=195.04s)]
*  And look at this arrogant person going, well, I mean, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=195.92s)]
*  we passed this abortion bill that's going to really massively negatively affect [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=200.2s)]
*  people's lives and it might actually cost a woman her life. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=205.12s)]
*  I'm in that situation now. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=207.68s)]
*  So I'll just call the governor and get an exception for myself. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=209.48s)]
*  And the rest of you pores or middle class Americans, well, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=213.12s)]
*  you might have to die in that hospital. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=217.0s)]
*  But I get to call the governor, the governor didn't answer, but [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=219.12s)]
*  I'm a special elite person. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=222.72s)]
*  There's a line she says at the end that really put me over the top, enraging. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=224.56s)]
*  So I will get to that in a second. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=229.8s)]
*  Okay, so here's what she said. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=231.56s)]
*  This is reported by the Wall Street Journal. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=233.76000000000002s)]
*  It was absolute fear mongering at its worst, she said. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=236.88000000000002s)]
*  She also knows that abortion rights activists might see the opposite, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=240.92000000000002s)]
*  that a Republican led restriction caused the confusion. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=245.16000000000003s)]
*  There will be some comments like, well, thank God we have abortion services, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=248.36s)]
*  even though what I went through wasn't an abortion. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=252.72000000000003s)]
*  That was the line, Ana. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=257.52000000000004s)]
*  No, it wasn't abortion. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=258.52000000000004s)]
*  It was definitely an abortion. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=260.36s)]
*  But see, this is just like the stories we reported on years ago, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=262.48s)]
*  where people that were so called pro-life activists, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=266.72s)]
*  they would be out picketing abortion clinics. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=270.92s)]
*  Then they would go in the back and get an abortion and then come back out and [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=273.96000000000004s)]
*  pick it. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=278.2s)]
*  No. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=278.84s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=279.47999999999996s)]
*  My God. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=280.0s)]
*  Literally, okay? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=280.56s)]
*  And then when the reporter asked them, my God, what are you doing, right? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=281.88s)]
*  And they're like, no, no, no, I'm not immoral like the rest of them. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=287.15999999999997s)]
*  I had to get it. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=291.44s)]
*  Right, right, okay, yeah. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=292.52s)]
*  Okay, but she's saying it to a whole different level. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=294.08s)]
*  Not, yeah, I'm not immoral, low life like these Democrats and stuff. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=296.32s)]
*  My abortion is necessary. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=301.28s)]
*  She's saying it's not even an abortion. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=302.52s)]
*  Yes, it is. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=304.64s)]
*  It is 100% an abortion. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=306.28000000000003s)]
*  But it doesn't matter. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=308.52s)]
*  If you're a politician, you just deny reality. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=309.28000000000003s)]
*  So her big argument is, it's the lefties who scared the doctors into thinking they [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=310.88s)]
*  might get prosecuted if they give me the abortion that I need to save my life or [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=316.68s)]
*  save my uterus. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=321.6s)]
*  Come on, really? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=325.40000000000003s)]
*  Really? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=327.32s)]
*  And by the way, I mean, first off, I know people in Florida. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=328.28000000000003s)]
*  I know women in Florida, I have family in Florida. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=335.28000000000003s)]
*  And they've dealt with this, okay? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=338.76s)]
*  It doesn't matter if her life is in danger. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=341.64000000000004s)]
*  It doesn't matter if the fetus is non viable, no heartbeat, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=344.04s)]
*  doesn't even have a skull. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=349.28000000000003s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=350.88s)]
*  The doctors are terrified and that was the point of the legislation. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=352.24s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=357.56s)]
*  I mean, that was the point. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=358.24s)]
*  I just, whatever, whatever, I give up, I give up. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=360.28000000000003s)]
*  What's amazing to me is the entitlement, right? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=364.24s)]
*  And the special case. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=368.15999999999997s)]
*  I'm a special case. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=369.47999999999996s)]
*  I'm entitled to the healthcare that I am cheering on in denying other women. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=370.59999999999997s)]
*  Other women, because there's plenty of, can you imagine? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=377.71999999999997s)]
*  She called the governor's office late at night, okay? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=381.2s)]
*  Late at night. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=384.48s)]
*  Having legal abortion means not having to debase yourself by hitting up [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=385.15999999999997s)]
*  a man in the middle of the night to beg him to allow you to get an abortion. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=390.84000000000003s)]
*  That's a great point, Anna. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=396.40000000000003s)]
*  And so, no, the doctors were worried because you would have them arrested. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=398.48s)]
*  If you said they did something wrong, it was the fifth week. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=405.40000000000003s)]
*  But you know what, if I counted from the time that you guys were playing hanky panky, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=409.88s)]
*  maybe it's the sixth week. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=414.28000000000003s)]
*  You're looking for an excuse to put doctors in prison so [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=415.68s)]
*  they won't do any abortions. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=419.04s)]
*  But all of a sudden when your ass needs one, you're like, no, please do it, please. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=421.04s)]
*  She's begging the doctors to do an abortion. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=427.36s)]
*  She's calling the Republican governor to get him to authorize an abortion. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=429.76s)]
*  All the meanwhile, saying, no, we're such lovely moral people. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=434.08s)]
*  And I don't know why the doctors would be nervous. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=440.72s)]
*  And okay, even in a best case scenario, let's say the doctors know that it's for [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=444.24s)]
*  sure five weeks and not six weeks, right? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=447.84s)]
*  By the way, you definitely can't be sure, okay? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=451.08s)]
*  And that's why they're nervous. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=453.47999999999996s)]
*  But okay, if it's in the sixth week, you would literally have them arrested. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=455.03999999999996s)]
*  Literally, the law you passed. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=461.52s)]
*  And you think it's a Democrat's fault that they're nervous? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=464.64s)]
*  Now these politicians have no bounds of decency. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=469.15999999999997s)]
*  So that's why when mainstream media sucks up to them, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=473.2s)]
*  they're like, these people are not the best of us. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=476.40000000000003s)]
*  They're the worst of us. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=479.16s)]
*  You should stop treating them with respect. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=481.44s)]
*  They've earned none of it. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=483.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=485.96000000000004s)]
*  So yeah, no, cry me a river about how you got an abortion, but [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=486.48s)]
*  you didn't get it as expeditiously and efficiently as you wanted. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=492.0s)]
*  As you're preventing other women in similar situations from getting the help [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=497.96000000000004s)]
*  they need, and some of them might die because of your heinous, disgusting law. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=502.12s)]
*  By the way, guys, look, we're now kind of famous or [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=508.35999999999996s)]
*  infamous for being open to Republican voters. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=512.88s)]
*  And so if you're a voter in Florida, you Democrat or Republican, understand, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=515.88s)]
*  among the politicians, it is the Republicans who are making abortion illegal. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=521.0s)]
*  It is the ones that are endangering the lives of women and taking their freedom [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=526.3199999999999s)]
*  away and having a big government thug come between you and your doctor. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=530.16s)]
*  And the government tyranny is taking your most essential freedom away from you, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=535.9599999999999s)]
*  your freedom to control your own body. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=541.64s)]
*  So if you vote for a Republican in Florida, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=545.0799999999999s)]
*  that is what you're voting for. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=546.9599999999999s)]
*  That's a stone cold fact. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=548.56s)]
*  There are other things you're voting for, and we could have those debates. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=550.04s)]
*  But you're for sure saying, take away my rights, I don't want them. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=553.64s)]
*  And if I have a miscarriage, then maybe you arrest me or my doctor. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=557.5999999999999s)]
*  If I have this type of pregnancy that's going to get me killed, but it's in the sixth or [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=561.4s)]
*  seventh week instead of the fifth week, you should arrest my doctor, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=566.1999999999999s)]
*  make sure that he doesn't do it, and then maybe I die. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=569.3199999999999s)]
*  But hey, it's okay because a Republican politician can call the governor and [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=572.4399999999999s)]
*  then pretend later that it wasn't an abortion. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=577.16s)]
*  All right, I just want to end the show by saying, if you haven't considered it [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=581.3199999999999s)]
*  before, I would like you to consider joining the boycott and divest movement. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=584.48s)]
*  Our lawmakers, our politicians, our presidents, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=590.8000000000001s)]
*  regardless of which side they represent, don't care about you. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=594.44s)]
*  They don't care about the people of Gaza, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=598.9200000000001s)]
*  they don't care about innocent children. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=600.5200000000001s)]
*  The only way that you can spur change in this disgusting paradigm that we're stuck [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=602.2800000000001s)]
*  in, where our resources are funneled toward a genocide, and [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=607.6s)]
*  we're supposed to shut up and take it. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=610.6800000000001s)]
*  The only way you can change it is through the boycott divest movement. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=612.4s)]
*  I used to be against it, I thought it was unfair to Israeli civilians, but [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=615.72s)]
*  this needs to change. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=620.12s)]
*  I'm going to be part of this movement now, I hope that you'll join me. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=621.56s)]
*  It's the only path I see to move forward. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=624.4399999999999s)]
*  Obviously, I mean, that's the only thing we could do to try to [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=627.36s)]
*  affect the genocide just a little bit. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=631.56s)]
*  I mean, why would you want to give your money to the government of Israel or [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=634.0s)]
*  to anything going on in Israel? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=637.24s)]
*  And it's not unfair to the civilians. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=638.64s)]
*  The civilians should vote out their government and [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=640.3199999999999s)]
*  create a two state solution where Israel would be a safe Jewish haven. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=642.4s)]
*  But that didn't constantly invade their neighbors and [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=646.0799999999999s)]
*  try to steal their land. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=648.16s)]
*  And so in which case everybody would live in peace until the citizens of [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=649.6s)]
*  Israel do that. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=652.88s)]
*  They shouldn't be attacked, they shouldn't be killed. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=653.8399999999999s)]
*  But we also don't have to give our money to them. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=655.6s)]
*  We didn't have to give our money to the white people in South Africa who were [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=657.92s)]
*  enforcing apartheid and abusing black people. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=662.72s)]
*  We're under no constitutional obligation to give them money and [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=665.28s)]
*  to do business with them. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=668.0s)]
*  We're under no obligation to do business with Israel. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=669.24s)]
*  Do you know that 37 states have passed laws saying that you won't be able to get [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=671.16s)]
*  American government contracts if you're part of the boycott and [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=675.4s)]
*  divestment and sanction movement against Israel? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=678.6800000000001s)]
*  And then they say no, America doesn't work for Israel. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=681.36s)]
*  Then why are we passing laws to protect just them? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=684.5600000000001s)]
*  There's no similar restrictions against Great Britain or Canada or [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=688.28s)]
*  France or Indonesia or no other country. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=693.04s)]
*  But if you dare protest Israel, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=696.68s)]
*  there will be severe consequences in America. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=698.6s)]
*  But if you say that Israel is controlling America, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=701.48s)]
*  that's protesting Israel, that's its severe consequences. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=704.52s)]
*  Arrested, deported, canceled, fired, etc. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=708.0s)]
*  Because the problem is you're too much of an anti-Semitic bigot because [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=712.08s)]
*  you're against a genocide. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=717.12s)]
*  And if you weren't such a bigot, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=719.4s)]
*  you would know that genocides are awesome as long as Israel does it. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=721.4399999999999s)]
*  Now all of you bow your heads. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=726.2s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below, an angel gets his swings. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=728.12s)]
*  Totally not true, but it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJhhQ4re9s&t=731.24s)]
