TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.
The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.
On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.
Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.
Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.
TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

# Charlie Kirk Gives PIGGISH Advice To High School Girls
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q)
*  Hi, Charlie, I'm Addie and I'm 14. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm a freshman in high school and [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=2.4s)]
*  I was wondering as someone who has [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  a different opinion on college. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=6.72s)]
*  What would you say the pros and [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=9.08s)]
*  cons are because I'm interested in [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  political journalism? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  And what would your advice be? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  I think there is an argument to [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=16.8s)]
*  bring back the MRS degree. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=18.56s)]
*  And no seriously. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=20.16s)]
*  I think you're making a really good [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=25.92s)]
*  case to bring back the PIG degree. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=27.8s)]
*  To that 14 year old girl, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=31.0s)]
*  I don't know if she'll ever see [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=32.32s)]
*  this. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=33.84s)]
*  If you have intellectual curiosity, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=34.4s)]
*  if you have a passion, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=36.6s)]
*  you want to do political journalism, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=38.0s)]
*  you go get it girl, you go get it. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=40.28s)]
*  Okay, pursue what you're interested [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=42.32s)]
*  in and don't ask Charlie Kirk for [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=44.36s)]
*  advice. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=46.28s)]
*  You're literally asking the worst [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=46.84s)]
*  person in the country for advice on [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  what you should do with your future [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=51.36s)]
*  as a young woman. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=53.64s)]
*  Anyway, at Turning Point USA's [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=55.84s)]
*  conference for conservative young [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=57.96s)]
*  women, where are her parents and [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=60.2s)]
*  why are they doing this to her? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=62.120000000000005s)]
*  But okay, Charlie Kirk told a crowd [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=64.0s)]
*  full of high schoolers, if they're [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=66.4s)]
*  interested in college, they should [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=69.04s)]
*  go get an MRS degree. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=71.6s)]
*  Okay, you just heard an example of [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=73.28s)]
*  it. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=75.12s)]
*  Now before we hear more from [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=75.62s)]
*  Charlie Kirk, who apparently knows [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=77.32000000000001s)]
*  what's best for young women, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=79.64s)]
*  let's just talk a little bit about. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=81.64s)]
*  Look, MRS degree, Mrs. degree, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=84.2s)]
*  he's basically saying, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=86.64s)]
*  you're going to get married, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=88.32000000000001s)]
*  you're going to be a parent, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=90.44s)]
*  you don't have kids, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=92.36s)]
*  you don't need to work. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=93.84s)]
*  He lives in a fantasy land. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=95.68s)]
*  He has a lot of money, he doesn't [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=97.28s)]
*  have to worry about his wife [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=99.36s)]
*  needing to work in order to make [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=101.16s)]
*  ends meet. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=103.24000000000001s)]
*  But also, even if they are rich and [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=104.12s)]
*  she doesn't need to work, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=106.60000000000001s)]
*  if she wants to pursue a career, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=108.48s)]
*  she should be able to do it. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=110.80000000000001s)]
*  But Charlie Kirk has been really [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=113.24000000000001s)]
*  aggressively pushing this, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=115.32000000000001s)]
*  ooh, traditional gender norms. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=117.56s)]
*  And if you're a woman, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=120.12s)]
*  you should be in the household, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=120.92s)]
*  you should be raising your kids. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=122.16000000000001s)]
*  Look, if you want to do that, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=123.68s)]
*  I really do respect it. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=125.44000000000001s)]
*  And I wish that we had an economy [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=127.16000000000001s)]
*  set up in which we didn't need dual [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=129.36s)]
*  income households to make ends meet. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=131.76000000000002s)]
*  That's what I want to get to. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=134.64000000000001s)]
*  I desperately want to get to [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=135.96s)]
*  an economic system that's far [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=137.44s)]
*  better than the trash that we have [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=139.08s)]
*  now, where we don't have these [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=141.0s)]
*  huge disparities in income and [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=143.08s)]
*  wealth among Americans. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=145.16s)]
*  And it's really pronounced in [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=147.2s)]
*  places like Los Angeles. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=148.96s)]
*  So a lot of working class people [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=150.92s)]
*  who live in these big cities, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=152.56s)]
*  for instance, they don't have [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=154.12s)]
*  the freaking luxury of being [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=155.68s)]
*  stay-at-home moms, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=157.12s)]
*  even if they desperately want it. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=158.16s)]
*  But look, I'm expecting Charlie [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=159.92000000000002s)]
*  Kirk, of all people, to get into [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=161.52s)]
*  this kind of conversation. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=163.0s)]
*  No, he's going to do like, ooh, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=164.36s)]
*  I owned you, get an MRS degree. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=166.2s)]
*  There's no depth to this guy. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=168.16s)]
*  All right, so with that in mind, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=172.56s)]
*  let's go to the next clip. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=173.88s)]
*  Let me also speak to some of [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=176.4s)]
*  the young ladies here in high [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=177.4s)]
*  school, who's here were your top [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=178.6s)]
*  priority? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=180.35999999999999s)]
*  Your top priority is get married and [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=180.92s)]
*  have kids, raise your hand. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=182.68s)]
*  Okay, interestingly, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=184.07999999999998s)]
*  I think there is an argument to [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=185.68s)]
*  bring back the MRS degree. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=187.84s)]
*  And no, seriously, and just be [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=189.88s)]
*  clear, that's why you're going to [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=192.12s)]
*  college, right? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=194.48s)]
*  Don't lie to yourself, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=195.88s)]
*  don't like, I'm going, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=197.32s)]
*  I'm studying sociology. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=198.6s)]
*  No, you're not, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=200.12s)]
*  we know why you're here. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=200.64000000000001s)]
*  And that's okay, actually. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=201.16s)]
*  And that's a really good reason to [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=203.2s)]
*  go to college, actually, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=205.0s)]
*  especially an SEC school. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=206.56s)]
*  You will find a husband if you have [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=209.24s)]
*  the intent to find a husband at [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=211.76s)]
*  Ole Miss, it's just going to [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=214.2s)]
*  happen, okay, or wherever. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=216.36s)]
*  Yeah, there you go, see? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=218.8s)]
*  Or at University of Alabama. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=220.08s)]
*  And but, there you go. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=221.72s)]
*  Sometimes, rarely, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=223.2s)]
*  I have expensive tastes, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=226.11999999999998s)]
*  all women do, depends. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=229.11999999999998s)]
*  It depends on what your thing is. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=232.51999999999998s)]

*  If you think about it, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=313.88s)]

*  some stuff, that's fine, I guess, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=343.08s)]

*  a lot of women went to college in [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=348.52s)]

*  You didn't go to college. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=371.44s)]
*  So why are you giving advice on [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=372.52s)]
*  finding a partner to marry in [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=374.4s)]
*  college? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=376.24s)]
*  And no, most people don't go to [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=377.79999999999995s)]
*  college because they're looking for [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=380.0s)]
*  a mate. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=382.56s)]
*  In fact, a lot of people go to [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=383.59999999999997s)]
*  college because we live in the type [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=385.03999999999996s)]
*  of economy where even to get a low [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=386.79999999999995s)]
*  level job, you need a four year [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=388.64s)]
*  degree at this point. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=390.32s)]
*  And I think we need to change that. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=391.64s)]
*  But people go to college because [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=394.32s)]
*  they don't want to live in poverty. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=396.08s)]
*  But then they end up taking on [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=398.47999999999996s)]
*  a massive amount of student loan [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=400.08s)]

*  There's a lot of messed up things [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=403.8s)]

*  joke and give them this crappy [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=414.47999999999996s)]
*  advice, I don't know, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=416.4s)]

*  because I would kill to go back to [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=420.15999999999997s)]
*  14 and know the things that I know [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=422.0s)]
*  today and do things a little [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=424.08s)]
*  differently. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=425.79999999999995s)]
*  But I was very lucky. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=427.20000000000005s)]
*  I had a lot of great adults in my [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=428.28000000000003s)]

*  marriage and a career. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=438.0s)]
*  It's not a happy career. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=442.56s)]
*  We talk about a lot of depressing [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=443.8s)]

*  I will say this, if you want to [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Lgjz0mc5Q&t=476.68s)]
