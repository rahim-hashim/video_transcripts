# Trump Says He Threatened To 'Bomb The S*** Out Of Moscow'
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [July 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA)
*  I don't know, we get a lot of thrown at us by Putin for you wanna know the truth. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=0.0s)]
*  He's very nice all the time, but it turns out to be meaningless. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=6.4s)]
*  Okay, well Trump, the master deal maker and negotiator, seems to have met his match in [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=11.64s)]
*  Vladimir Putin, the Russian president who has been notoriously difficult for American [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=18.76s)]
*  presidents to work with. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=23.16s)]
*  That new audio reveals that while Trump was on the 2024 presidential campaign trail, he [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=25.08s)]
*  was bragging about his ability to scare leaders like Putin and Xi Jinping into submission. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=31.2s)]
*  The strategy, the more unhinged, the better. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=37.36s)]
*  Putin, I said, if you go in to Ukraine, they'll bomb it out of Moscow. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=40.8s)]
*  I'm telling you, I had no choice but to vote for him. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=48.239999999999995s)]
*  So he goes like, I don't believe you. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=53.239999999999995s)]
*  He said no way, and I said way. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=58.239999999999995s)]
*  And then he goes like, I don't believe you, but the truth is he believed me 10%. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=59.239999999999995s)]
*  And I told you this, he believed me 10%. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=64.24s)]
*  And then I'm with President Xi of China, but I said the same thing to them. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=67.24s)]
*  I said, if you go into Taiwan, I'm gonna bomb the Beijing. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=71.67999999999999s)]
*  He thought I was crazy. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=74.67999999999999s)]
*  He said, hey, you're going to bomb Beijing. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=75.67999999999999s)]
*  I said, I have no choice, I got a problem. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=76.67999999999999s)]
*  We're gonna bomb Beijing. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=77.67999999999999s)]
*  And he didn't believe either, except 10%. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=78.67999999999999s)]
*  And 10% is all you need. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=79.67999999999999s)]
*  In fact, 5% wouldn't have been okay to. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=80.67999999999999s)]
*  And we never had a problem. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=81.67999999999999s)]
*  We would have never had a problem. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=82.67999999999999s)]
*  I love that audio. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=83.68s)]
*  He's like, hey, Putin, I'm gonna have to bomb Moscow. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=96.80000000000001s)]
*  And he goes, no way. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=100.72s)]
*  And I said way, like for real, watch out. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=102.0s)]
*  I might just bomb Moscow. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=105.58000000000001s)]
*  You never know. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=107.2s)]
*  He's so crazy. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=108.2s)]
*  He's so unhinged. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=109.2s)]
*  That's the strategy there. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=110.2s)]
*  So Trump, according to Trump, threatened to bomb the capital cities of both Russia and [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=111.96s)]
*  China in order to get the leaders of those countries to behave the way that he would [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=116.28s)]
*  like them to behave. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=120.24s)]
*  And this is the first time that we're learning about these alleged threats that were made. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=122.24s)]
*  In the past, he had often suggested that had he won the presidency in 2020, Putin never [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=126.44s)]
*  would have invaded Ukraine in the first place. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=133.0s)]
*  He said that he had some strongly worded private discussions with Putin that had dissuaded [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=135.62s)]
*  him from taking military action against Ukraine. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=141.24s)]
*  But then once Trump was ousted and was no longer in office, then Putin felt free to [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=144.08s)]
*  invade without the threat of a crazy Trump looming over his head. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=148.84s)]
*  So at the time, Trump never went into any detail about what those discussions entailed. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=153.18s)]
*  Here's what he said. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=158.32000000000002s)]
*  I had a very strong conversation with President Putin, and he understood. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=160.42000000000002s)]
*  And I won't go into the great details of the conversation, cuz nobody has to know that. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=165.26000000000002s)]
*  But I will tell you, it never ever would have happened. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=169.76s)]
*  I don't wanna say it. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=172.51999999999998s)]
*  But did they fear me? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=174.51999999999998s)]
*  I suspect they did. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=175.51999999999998s)]
*  Either way, there's no way to prove or disprove that one, any of these conversations or threats [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=180.28s)]
*  actually took place. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=185.48s)]
*  Or two, that either Putin or Xi Jinping abstained from taking military action specifically because [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=187.16s)]
*  they were so scared of what Trump might do. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=193.12s)]
*  So these audio recordings were obtained by Josh Dawsey, Tyler Pager, and Isaac Arnsdorf. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=195.95999999999998s)]
*  They're the authors of the new book, 2024, How Trump Retook the White House and the Democrats [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=202.6s)]
*  Lost America, quite a title. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=208.2s)]
*  And the timing of this audio release is interesting because Trump is currently struggling to get, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=211.23999999999998s)]
*  it seems, any world leader, let alone Vladimir Putin or Xi Jinping, to do what he wants them [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=216.29999999999998s)]
*  to do. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=221.64s)]
*  For instance, he just threatened new tariffs on nations supporting the anti-American BRICS [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=222.64s)]
*  nations. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=228.23999999999998s)]
*  Of course, China and Russia are both founding BRICS countries. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=229.23999999999998s)]
*  His State Department has failed to secure the release of Americans being held in Venezuela [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=234.27999999999997s)]
*  right now. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=239.27999999999997s)]
*  So that is not exactly a win for the State Department. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=240.32s)]
*  And despite a freeze from the Pentagon, Trump announced, while Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=243.83999999999997s)]
*  was sitting right next to him, that the United States would, in fact, be sending more weapons [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=249.35999999999999s)]
*  to Ukraine. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=254.35999999999999s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=255.35999999999999s)]
*  Are you planning to send more weapons to Ukraine? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=256.36s)]
*  We're gonna send some more weapons. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=260.96s)]
*  They have to be able to defend themselves. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=262.52s)]
*  They're getting hit very hard now. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=264.96s)]
*  They're getting hit very hard. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=267.4s)]
*  We're gonna have to send more weapons. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=268.4s)]
*  You have defensive weapons, primarily, but they're getting hit very, very hard. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=269.68s)]
*  So many people are dying in that mess. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=276.4s)]
*  I'm sorry, I meant to tell you guys to pay attention to Hegseth's face in that clip because [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=279.03999999999996s)]
*  he's just sitting there kind of puzzled and nodding along and blinking very erratically [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=286.28s)]
*  because he's just like, what is he saying? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=291.9s)]
*  Because Hegseth and the Defense Department had just put a freeze on sending these weapons [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=294.12s)]
*  to Ukraine. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=298.32s)]
*  And here is Trump saying something else. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=299.32s)]
*  So was this is not an isolated incident where we're seeing Trump kind of undermine the [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=300.67999999999995s)]
*  other people in his cabinet? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=306.38s)]
*  He's done it with Marco Rubio, his secretary of state. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=308.06s)]
*  He's done it now in that clip you just saw with Hegseth, his secretary of defense. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=311.74s)]
*  And he also is seen on camera not really knowing what's going on with his own tariffs. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=316.88s)]
*  And now he's making all these threats to nations saying I'm gonna increase the terrorists if [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=322.34s)]
*  you don't back away from supporting these BRICS nations. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=326.62s)]
*  So he thinks, I guess in his mind, he thinks this makes him look like a strong man. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=330.42s)]
*  He's like, don't you do it or else I'm gonna put more tariffs on you. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=335.34s)]
*  It is weak, right? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=339.7s)]
*  He's having to threaten them. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=341.65999999999997s)]
*  He's trying to scare these people or these countries into submission when the reality [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=342.9s)]
*  is these countries are gonna align themselves with whichever country is the most beneficial [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=347.23999999999995s)]
*  for them. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=353.02s)]
*  So if Trump just had something better to offer these nations, he wouldn't have to threaten [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=354.44s)]
*  them in order to get them away from the allure of Russia and China. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=358.62s)]
*  So it seems weak, it seems like he has nothing to offer. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=364.7s)]
*  He also seems kind of like he's being Israel's little puppet there cuz the clip that we just [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=367.97999999999996s)]
*  saw with him and Pete Hegseth, that was at a dinner with Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=373.3s)]
*  And allegedly it was at the behest of Netanyahu that Trump said, yeah, we have to send more [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=378.78s)]
*  weapons to Ukraine. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=383.62s)]
*  So was what are your thoughts on all of this? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=385.03999999999996s)]
*  It's quite a lot actually. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=388.52s)]
*  I mean, you shouldn't really be surprised in terms of Russia's response to Trump being [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=390.38s)]
*  like member on the campaign. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=397.82s)]
*  I'm gonna end the war in Ukraine on day one. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=399.65999999999997s)]
*  But the bottom line is the Americans as Donald Trump told the Ukrainian Prime Minister have [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=403.18s)]
*  no cards. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=413.58s)]
*  They've levied every single sanction. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=415.09999999999997s)]
*  They sold Ukraine every single weapon. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=419.38s)]
*  These sanctions we were told the most onerous in the history of the American Empire were [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=424.46s)]
*  supposed to cripple Russia and their economy. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=429.9s)]
*  The opposite has happened. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=433.21999999999997s)]
*  They've actually become more self-sufficient. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=434.7s)]
*  Their economy has actually grown in the time since the sanctions happened. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=437.02s)]
*  So you can't give Ukraine any more weapons. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=441.42s)]
*  You can give them more weapons, but it's not gonna help them. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=444.1s)]
*  They're losing the war. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=446.5s)]
*  You can put more sanctions on, levy more sanctions on Russia. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=447.98s)]
*  It's not gonna change anything. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=451.3s)]
*  They have no incentive to be bullied by the United States here. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=453.02000000000004s)]
*  To be honest, the only thing that would make sense is total capitulation on the part of [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=457.62s)]
*  Ukraine and everybody admitting this was all a big mistake. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=461.90000000000003s)]
*  We need to stop, let Ukraine just keep the territory that it currently occupies and holds [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=464.90000000000003s)]
*  and accept the L. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=470.02000000000004s)]
*  Because Russia has no incentive to capitulate at all. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=472.18s)]
*  His whole thing about, I told him I was gonna bomb, Trump really admires Richard Nixon, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=477.73999999999995s)]
*  which is hilarious and obvious in so many ways. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=482.97999999999996s)]
*  And Nixon kinda coined the madman theory during the war in Vietnam, where I guess he taught [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=486.78s)]
*  the Viet Cong soldiers would be scared if he did an indiscriminate carpet bombing of [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=491.78s)]
*  Cambodia and Laos. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=498.41999999999996s)]
*  Just so you guys know, they were not. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=501.9s)]
*  They ended up winning the Vietnam War despite the madman theory, which is just so stupid. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=503.38s)]
*  You're using a theory that was proven not to work. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=509.02s)]
*  But yeah, it's just crazy. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=512.8199999999999s)]
*  Of course the bluster, the idea that China and Russia are scared that you're gonna actually [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=514.5799999999999s)]
*  bomb them when those guys can strike America at the snap of a finger. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=519.42s)]
*  And Trump would like over Taiwan and Ukraine, we're gonna attack the two biggest military [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=524.66s)]
*  powers in the world outside of ours and have freaking California or New York get blown [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=532.3s)]
*  to smithereens cuz Trump wanted to preemptively attack. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=538.62s)]
*  This is all just nonsense and Trump bluster, but we shouldn't be surprised by now. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=542.18s)]
*  I think he's been shown with the tariffs, with the Ukraine war, with the war in the [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=547.26s)]
*  Middle East. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=552.62s)]
*  He's got his tail between his legs. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=553.74s)]
*  None of his campaign promises are coming true at all. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=555.14s)]
*  Yeah, and he promised 90 deals in 90 days. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=558.54s)]
*  I believe, correct me if I'm wrong. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=562.0999999999999s)]
*  Are we 90 days in? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=564.06s)]
*  Today is day 90. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=565.42s)]
*  Yeah, today, it's right now. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=566.78s)]
*  And I haven't seen the deals. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=568.62s)]
*  I don't know where they are. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=569.9799999999999s)]
*  Maybe they're coming. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=572.06s)]
*  He still has a few more hours before the end of the day. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=573.06s)]
*  But you're absolutely right. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=575.06s)]
*  And about the bluster, right? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=576.3s)]
*  Because a lot of what he's saying, now you can't prove it one way or the other. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=578.8199999999999s)]
*  You can't prove that Putin made a certain decision or Xi Jinping made a certain decision [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=581.62s)]
*  based on what Trump said or did or didn't do. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=586.5799999999999s)]
*  And an example of that is China and Taiwan. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=589.9s)]
*  Trump said, if you invade Taiwan, I'm gonna have to bomb Beijing and maybe Xi Jinping [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=595.06s)]
*  believed him five, 10%, whatever his number was. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=601.5s)]
*  But the thing is, the Biden administration also threatened military action against China [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=605.18s)]
*  if they invaded Taiwan. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=609.9s)]
*  So I don't know if Trump is saying, well, my threat was better than what Biden was doing. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=611.66s)]
*  It was more acute. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=616.26s)]
*  It was more antagonistic and more inflammatory. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=617.26s)]
*  But either way, there's a lot of reasons why Xi Jinping could have chosen not to invade [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=621.86s)]
*  Taiwan, at least as of yet, right? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=627.5400000000001s)]
*  There's political reasons, there's economic reasons. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=630.74s)]
*  And also, there is the threat of military action from the United States. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=633.46s)]
*  But that didn't just come from Trump. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=637.5400000000001s)]
*  That's been there throughout the whole Biden administration. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=639.1800000000001s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below, an angel gets his swings. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=642.02s)]
*  Totally not true, but it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LHvh4sMXA&t=644.9399999999999s)]
