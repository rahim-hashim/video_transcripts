"ELON MUSK has been the Democratic Party‚Äôs boogeyman since shortly after President DONALD TRUMP deputized him as a top adviser.
But the billionaire‚Äôs recent breaks with the GOP ‚Äî Musk ripped Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúbig, beautiful bill‚Äù as a ‚Äúdisgusting abomination‚Äù on X this week and threatened to ‚Äúfire all politicians‚Äù who backed it ‚Äî are complicating the party‚Äôs portrayal of him as a chainsaw-wielding, bureaucracy-breaking villain.

# Democrats TUSSLE Over Courting Elon Musk After Falling Out With Trump
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0)
*  Now that Elon Musk and Donald Trump [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=0.0s)]
*  are at odds having a public falling [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=2.0s)]
*  out, some think that this could be [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=4.0200000000000005s)]
*  an opportunity for Democrats to [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=6.08s)]
*  cozy up to Elon Musk to help kill [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=8.08s)]
*  Donald Trump's big beautiful bill. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=10.28s)]
*  But not everyone agrees on the [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=13.08s)]
*  issue and you might be surprised at [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=14.84s)]
*  where some people fall. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=16.78s)]
*  Before we get into the details at [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=18.18s)]
*  first glance, Cenk, is there any [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=20.38s)]
*  room right now for Democrats to [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=22.76s)]
*  engage with Musk in a dialogue? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=25.0s)]
*  Yeah, definitely, I would engage [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=28.0s)]
*  in Musk dialogue right now. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=30.04s)]
*  I'd bring him on and [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=31.68s)]
*  I'd talk to him and [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=32.72s)]
*  that's called a dialogue. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=33.64s)]
*  So yes. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=35.72s)]
*  Okay, all right, well, we'll see. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=37.760000000000005s)]
*  So the debate was ignited by [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=39.400000000000006s)]
*  Congressman Ro Khanna, who said [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=41.160000000000004s)]
*  that Dems should, quote, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=43.36s)]
*  be in a dialogue with Musk given [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=44.92s)]
*  their shared opposition to Trump's [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=46.64s)]
*  big beautiful bill. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=48.8s)]
*  Said we should ultimately be trying [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=50.56s)]
*  to convince him that the Democratic [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=52.32s)]
*  party has more of the values that [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=54.0s)]
*  he agrees with. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=55.480000000000004s)]
*  A commitment to science funding, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=56.28s)]
*  a commitment to clean technology, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=57.7s)]
*  a commitment to seeing international [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=59.300000000000004s)]
*  students like him. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=61.28s)]
*  In response, Neocon, Bill Kristol [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=62.28s)]
*  wrote in a column at the Bulwark, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=65.08s)]
*  the American people don't like [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=67.52s)]
*  Elon Musk. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=69.88s)]
*  Polls show him with an average [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=72.04s)]
*  approval rating at 40% favorable to [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=74.16s)]
*  54% unfavorable. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=76.92s)]
*  So why embrace him? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=78.68s)]
*  It may well be enjoyable if not [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=80.56s)]
*  productive for Democrats to try and [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=82.32000000000001s)]
*  sow division within the MAGA [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=84.36s)]
*  districts. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=86.44000000000001s)]
*  Certainly, Musk's opposition to [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=87.04s)]
*  the budget bill can be used [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  politically in targeted ways to [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=90.48s)]
*  make life more difficult for some [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=92.2s)]
*  Republican senators and [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=93.92s)]
*  congressmen in their states and [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=95.16000000000001s)]
*  districts. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=96.88000000000001s)]
*  For one thing, if you want to [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=97.64s)]
*  criticize the Republican bill [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=99.24000000000001s)]
*  because it increases the debt, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=100.94000000000001s)]
*  you don't need Musk. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=102.64000000000001s)]
*  The nonpartisan Congressional [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=104.0s)]
*  Budget Office is directed by Phil [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=106.06s)]
*  Swagel, a respected economist who [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=108.04s)]
*  served in a Republican [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=110.12s)]
*  administration. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=111.44000000000001s)]
*  The CBO released its analysis of [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=112.64000000000001s)]
*  the House bill yesterday. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=115.47999999999999s)]
*  It shows that the Republican bill [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=117.27999999999999s)]
*  adds 2.4 trillion to the national [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=119.19999999999999s)]
*  debt over the next decade. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=121.24s)]
*  And this is actual analysis, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=122.96s)]
*  not a billionaire's hissy fit. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=124.83999999999999s)]
*  Kristol then goes on, and [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=127.32s)]
*  this is where I was even surprised. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=128.79999999999998s)]
*  But he goes on to point out that [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=131.2s)]
*  the deficit isn't even the [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=133.07999999999998s)]
*  strongest line of attack. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=134.64s)]
*  It's that they need to focus on [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=136.84s)]
*  the Medicaid cuts in the bill. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=138.44s)]
*  What is big is that the CBO [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=140.79999999999998s)]
*  analysis also shows that [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=142.6s)]
*  the bills changes to Medicaid and [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=144.6s)]
*  the Affordable Care Act will result [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=146.72s)]
*  in nearly 11 million Americans [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=149.0s)]
*  losing their health insurance. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=151.0s)]
*  That's real, that's tangible, and [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=153.12s)]
*  that's well worth focusing on [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=155.68s)]
*  politically. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=157.72s)]
*  Cenk, I feel like I'm in [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=158.96s)]
*  the Twilight Zone. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=160.72s)]
*  Since when is Bill Kristol the voice [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=162.36s)]
*  of reason on Medicaid cuts? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=165.04s)]
*  Yeah, since he's pretending to be [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=167.8s)]
*  a Democratic convert, I guess. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=170.12s)]
*  I don't even know if he's still [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=173.08s)]
*  saying that or if he's saying that [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=174.76s)]
*  he's an ever Trump Republican. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=176.64s)]
*  Bill Kristol was maybe the top [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=178.72s)]
*  influence in pushing us into [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=180.92s)]
*  the Iraq War. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=183.04s)]
*  So I'm not overly concerned about [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=184.32s)]
*  his opinion. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=187.8s)]
*  And do I trust Ro Khanna, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=189.88s)]
*  who was Bernie's co-chair of his [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=192.04s)]
*  presidential campaign, or the neo [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=194.8s)]
*  con who started the Iraq War? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=197.6s)]
*  Yeah, I'll go with Ro, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=199.6s)]
*  I think that's an easy one. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=200.72s)]
*  So that's point one, but [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=202.52s)]
*  the more important point is that [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=204.12s)]
*  Bill Kristol is just, in my opinion, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=206.12s)]
*  totally wrong. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=208.44s)]
*  I'm curious what you think. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=209.16000000000003s)]
*  I'll just say, just to start [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=210.48000000000002s)]
*  the conversation, he says, no, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=212.20000000000002s)]
*  we should focus on the CBO's [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=214.4s)]
*  analysis rather than a billionaire's [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=216.20000000000002s)]
*  hissy fit. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=218.68s)]
*  Well, this happened before the Musk [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=219.36s)]
*  Trump blow up, right? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=222.56s)]
*  And what I was planning to say on [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=225.56s)]
*  it this morning, and we talked [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=227.28s)]
*  about it in the production meeting [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=228.96s)]
*  Yeah, but who gets more attention? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=231.2s)]
*  Random CBO dude or Elon Musk, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=234.35999999999999s)]
*  that's not close. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=236.96s)]
*  And what do you need in order to [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=239.68s)]
*  prevent the bill from happening? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=241.28s)]
*  You need a lot of attention to what [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=243.24s)]
*  is wrong with the bill. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=245.4s)]
*  So if Elon Musk is pointing out [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=247.4s)]
*  what's wrong with the bill, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=249.07999999999998s)]
*  it creates a giant deficit. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=250.68s)]
*  I'll take that yes for an answer, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=253.51999999999998s)]
*  and I'll work on it. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=255.64s)]
*  And then, obviously, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=257.04s)]
*  later in the day, I would argue, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=258.36s)]
*  we were proven spectacularly right [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=260.4s)]
*  with Elon Musk torpedoing Donald [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=263.71999999999997s)]
*  Trump and now creating this giant [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=266.71999999999997s)]
*  civil war. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=269.4s)]
*  And what's happening is that [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=270.44s)]
*  MAGA is getting split. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=271.71999999999997s)]
*  They're saying, well, I mean, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=272.91999999999996s)]
*  it does add to the deficit. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=274.64s)]
*  Now, that's a thing that the [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=276.47999999999996s)]
*  Republicans never acknowledged [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=277.59999999999997s)]
*  before. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=278.96s)]
*  And then he says, why don't we take [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=279.88s)]
*  away the oil and gas subsidies? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=281.11999999999995s)]
*  And now there's a lot of MAGA [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=282.35999999999996s)]
*  saying, yeah, wait, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=283.84s)]
*  why are we giving oil and gas? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=284.96s)]
*  People don't know that [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=287.0s)]
*  if you voted for Trump, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=289.12s)]
*  you probably got your news from [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=291.0s)]
*  a lot of right-wing media. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=293.24s)]
*  They never talk about oil and [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=295.76s)]
*  gas subsidies. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=297.48s)]
*  They also don't talk about Tesla [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=299.08s)]
*  subsidies, and then Donald Trump [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=300.52s)]
*  attacks Elon Musk with the Tesla [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=302.16s)]
*  subsidies, and maybe we shouldn't [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=303.84000000000003s)]
*  give those. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=305.68s)]
*  That's an awesome conversation for [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=307.12s)]
*  the left, because it's the right [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=308.84000000000003s)]
*  exposing one another and all [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=310.64s)]
*  the goodies that they're giving [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=312.2s)]
*  away to their donor class. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=313.8s)]
*  So I think this is a super easy [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=315.32s)]
*  question. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=317.48s)]
*  What do you think, Jordan? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=318.12s)]
*  I mean, I'm with not as a person or [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=321.28s)]
*  an ideology, but I think what [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=324.04s)]
*  Crystal identifies, let them fight [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=326.48s)]
*  it out and let that division [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=329.52s)]
*  happen. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=331.68s)]
*  Yes, strategically, like you're [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=332.68s)]
*  saying, I think I'm with you there. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=334.36s)]
*  Go amplify some of the elements, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=336.28s)]
*  oil and gas subsidies, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=338.28s)]
*  EV subsidies, okay, sure. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=339.76s)]
*  I don't think Tesla should be [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=342.08s)]
*  getting most of those subsidies. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=343.72s)]
*  I think we should see more robust [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=345.88s)]
*  domestic manufacturers. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=347.36s)]
*  Biden tried to do that through [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=348.8s)]
*  the Build Back Better plan for [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=350.6s)]
*  unionized shops. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=352.40000000000003s)]
*  That's great, Tesla notoriously not [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=353.68s)]
*  unionized. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=355.88s)]
*  I just, I don't, in fairness, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=356.92s)]
*  I think we're having a totally [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=358.84000000000003s)]
*  different conversation now than we [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=360.68s)]
*  would have had if it was 12 hours [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=362.76s)]
*  ago. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=364.72s)]
*  I was ready to go this morning, and [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=365.22s)]
*  I think you also have to step back [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=367.08000000000004s)]
*  and be like, we're in a kind of [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=368.8s)]
*  a different landscape between [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=370.44s)]
*  Trump and Elon right now. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=371.92s)]
*  I don't think anybody should touch [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=373.24s)]
*  Elon right now. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=374.92s)]
*  And overall, and I think it was [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=375.68s)]
*  said today, he is not somebody who [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=377.28s)]
*  is sensible or rational, and [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=379.79999999999995s)]
*  he seems to be very, very impulsive. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=382.0s)]
*  I mean, we had that story last week [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=385.47999999999996s)]
*  about his alleged drug use. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=387.44s)]
*  You went from him criticizing [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=389.03999999999996s)]
*  the bill because it raises the [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=391.15999999999997s)]
*  deficit and doesn't cut enough, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=393.32s)]
*  like three days ago, to calling [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=395.76s)]
*  Donald Trump a pedophile and [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=398.11999999999995s)]
*  saying he should be impeached [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=400.11999999999995s)]
*  because of mild comments and [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=402.28s)]
*  a press gaggle in the Oval Office. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=404.47999999999996s)]
*  Trump said, I'm very disappointed [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=407.36s)]
*  about Elon and made a couple [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=409.2s)]
*  slights at him, always out, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=410.36s)]
*  now he misses it. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=411.76s)]
*  In Trump terms, that was not that [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=413.44s)]
*  bad, and Elon had a meltdown. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=415.28000000000003s)]
*  That alone should give people some [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=417.52s)]
*  pause, I think I'm good. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=419.32s)]
*  You guys go fight, I'll cheer it on, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=421.04s)]
*  I'll root for you both to lose. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=423.04s)]
*  I just don't see any utility in [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=424.84000000000003s)]
*  Democrats trying to lift up his [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=426.64s)]
*  attacks on the bill when his [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=428.56s)]
*  attacks on the bill are mostly [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=430.32s)]
*  rooted in the deficit and [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=432.32s)]
*  cuts being insufficient. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=434.08s)]
*  Because he's upset that not enough [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=435.8s)]
*  Doge cuts were codified. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=437.2s)]
*  Yeah, so let me acknowledge what [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=438.76s)]
*  you're saying and then tell you [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=440.68s)]
*  what I think is the next layer. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=442.64s)]
*  So guys, what happens normally, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=444.64s)]
*  and I've covered this now endless [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=447.08s)]
*  times because we're the longest [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=449.44s)]
*  running show in internet history. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=451.68s)]
*  So we've been through this trick [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=453.92s)]
*  a thousand times. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=455.52s)]
*  So what the Republicans do is they [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=456.76s)]
*  propose a bill that would give [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=458.16s)]
*  massive tax cuts to rich overall, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=459.44s)]
*  right? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=461.0s)]
*  And then they usually cut from [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=462.0s)]
*  the average person, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=463.36s)]
*  in this case Medicaid. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=464.32s)]
*  Snap, etc. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=465.76s)]
*  And now they're considering [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=466.56s)]
*  Medicare. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=467.64s)]
*  And then the right wing objects [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=468.2s)]
*  the bill. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=469.92s)]
*  The Democrats usually are useless. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=471.0s)]
*  They never do anything. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=472.71999999999997s)]
*  They never object and [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=474.44s)]
*  they always lose and [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=475.4s)]
*  the bill always passes, right? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=476.32s)]
*  So they're almost never relevant. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=478.15999999999997s)]
*  So but the right wing Tea Party or [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=479.28s)]
*  in this case, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=481.44s)]
*  Elon Musk, Rand Paul, etc. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=482.36s)]
*  Come in and go, no, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=484.4s)]
*  I object to the bill, why? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=485.8s)]
*  It's not right wing enough. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=487.8s)]
*  It doesn't cut enough. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=489.48s)]
*  They never ever say it has too much [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=491.28s)]
*  tax cuts for the rich or [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=493.15999999999997s)]
*  for corporations, which is actually [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=494.52000000000004s)]
*  the heart of the problem. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=496.84000000000003s)]
*  That's where most of the money is, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=498.96000000000004s)]
*  right? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=501.08000000000004s)]
*  So they'll try to nickel and [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=502.16s)]
*  dime and take away and [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=503.16s)]
*  then they'll have a fake fight. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=504.12s)]
*  And at the end of the fake fight, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=505.96000000000004s)]
*  they'll go, okay, what can we do? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=507.36s)]
*  We'll give even more to the rich [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=509.32s)]
*  and take away even more from [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=510.72s)]
*  the average American. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=511.92s)]
*  And so those are useless fake [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=513.16s)]
*  fights. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=515.76s)]
*  And so you don't want to encourage [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=516.72s)]
*  the right wing in that kind of [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=519.4s)]
*  fake fight because they're never [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=521.72s)]
*  going to do anything positive. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=524.36s)]
*  All they're going to do is cut more [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=525.96s)]
*  right from the average guy. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=527.28s)]
*  So in this case, what I sense was, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=528.64s)]
*  no, this one's different. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=531.08s)]
*  It's the entire playbook is [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=533.12s)]
*  the same, Rand Paul is saying, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=535.2s)]
*  my God, we've got to make sure that [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=537.88s)]
*  we don't touch the tax cuts. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=540.64s)]
*  He's like, I would just vote on [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=543.4s)]
*  the tax cuts period. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=545.0s)]
*  Well, that would create [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=546.44s)]
*  a bigger deficit. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=547.28s)]
*  That would put a $3.6 trillion hole [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=548.0s)]
*  in the budget instead of a $2.4 [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=550.08s)]
*  trillion hole in the budget. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=551.96s)]
*  So that's even worse, right? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=553.88s)]
*  So that's the normal tea party [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=555.68s)]
*  right wing play, right? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=557.68s)]
*  But Elon Musk is a giant wild card. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=559.64s)]
*  And to Jordan's point, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=562.36s)]
*  he's impulsive. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=564.16s)]
*  So if you keep egging him on, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=565.64s)]
*  yeah, no, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=567.56s)]
*  it does create a big deficit. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=568.28s)]
*  First of all, what's happening? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=570.16s)]
*  MAGA for the first time in their [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=571.16s)]
*  lives is having a debate about [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=573.0s)]
*  the deficit under a Republican [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=574.8s)]
*  president. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=576.76s)]
*  Normally what happens is [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=578.08s)]
*  Republicans, when there's [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=579.36s)]
*  a Democratic president, they're [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=580.72s)]
*  like, the deficit is the debt, cut, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=582.52s)]
*  cut, cut, and don't give anything [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=584.24s)]
*  to the average American, don't give [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=585.72s)]
*  anything to them, right? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=587.12s)]
*  And then a Republican comes in [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=588.08s)]
*  and goes, I'm going to do [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=589.2s)]
*  a quadrillion dollar tax cut for [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=590.08s)]
*  the rich, but don't worry, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=591.4s)]
*  I cut from the poor and [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=592.76s)]
*  from the middle class. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=593.88s)]
*  And then Republicans are like, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=595.6s)]
*  I don't see the deficit, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=597.28s)]
*  I don't see the debt, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=598.4s)]
*  I don't see it at all, right? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=599.32s)]
*  But now they're seeing it, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=600.84s)]
*  because Elon Musk has this giant [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=602.72s)]
*  megaphone, and he's going, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=604.84s)]
*  it's going to add to the deficit. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=606.76s)]
*  I want to encourage that. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=609.6800000000001s)]
*  That is true, and I want right [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=611.1999999999999s)]
*  wingers to know that, and [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=612.8399999999999s)]
*  I want independents, most of all, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=614.4399999999999s)]
*  to know that. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=616.48s)]
*  And now that they've had such [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=617.7199999999999s)]
*  a spectacular fight, people are all [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=619.24s)]
*  going to notice at the end, yes, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=621.28s)]
*  this added trillions to the deficit, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=623.24s)]
*  and it was the Republicans, and [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=625.6s)]
*  it was Donald Trump who did it, and [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=627.6s)]
*  it was the taxis for [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=629.6s)]
*  the rich that did it. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=630.8399999999999s)]
*  And then they start pointing out [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=632.4399999999999s)]
*  the subsidies, my God, the [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=634.0799999999999s)]
*  subsidies have never been exposed. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=635.68s)]

*  exposed to American people for [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=639.72s)]
*  decades, we scream about it on [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=641.6s)]

*  wherezarkut.com that's saying, hey, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=645.2s)]
*  Elon, if you're going to get [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=647.6s)]
*  subsidies to Tesla, where's our cut? [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=649.24s)]
*  The American taxpayer is making [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=651.6s)]

*  Tesla, and we never have that [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=656.12s)]

*  the oil and gas subsidies? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=661.1600000000001s)]
*  Yes, finally someone's talking [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=662.5600000000001s)]

*  no reason. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=669.4399999999999s)]
*  And then Trump's like, yeah, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=670.0s)]
*  how about the Tesla subsidies? [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=671.4399999999999s)]
*  Good, perfect, have that fight, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=672.92s)]

*  In Susan Collins' case, in addition [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=748.8000000000001s)]
*  to that, rural hospitals. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=751.0400000000001s)]
*  And then in John Curtis and [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=752.76s)]
*  Tom Tillis, green energy credits [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=754.68s)]
*  because a lot of their constituents [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=757.04s)]
*  have those types of jobs, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=759.4s)]
*  their wind farms or solar farms. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=761.02s)]
*  So they're worried about those [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=763.12s)]
*  aspects as well. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=764.72s)]
*  I think leaning into that also pays [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=765.76s)]
*  dividends for us because hey, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=768.24s)]
*  this is an issue that we care about. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=770.36s)]
*  We can share in that messaging, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=773.0s)]
*  add to it versus trying to agitate [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=775.64s)]
*  for more cuts or [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=778.28s)]
*  addressing the deficit problem. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=779.64s)]
*  That doesn't affect people. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=783.0799999999999s)]
*  If we want to really push these [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=785.3199999999999s)]
*  people and get people fired up and [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=787.0799999999999s)]
*  call their member of Congress to [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=788.9599999999999s)]
*  get them to vote no, you're going [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=790.76s)]
*  to get more people to show up over [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=792.56s)]
*  Medicaid cuts than the deficit. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=794.24s)]
*  The deficit is like caring about it [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=795.76s)]
*  is a privileged position. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=797.56s)]
*  Someone who's extremely wealthy [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=799.0799999999999s)]
*  would care about that. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=800.64s)]
*  Someone who's in finance would care [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=801.64s)]
*  about that. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=803.0799999999999s)]
*  Working people are the working [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=803.5999999999999s)]
*  poor who rely on Medicaid. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=805.26s)]
*  That's what matters to them. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=806.88s)]
*  It's like a hierarchy of needs [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=807.9599999999999s)]
*  thing. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=809.36s)]
*  So zeroing in on that issue, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=809.9599999999999s)]
*  I think is smart. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=811.4s)]
*  Let Elon fight it out. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=812.44s)]
*  The guy's impulsive. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=813.84s)]
*  Maybe according to the New York [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=815.2s)]
*  Times has a drug problem. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=816.6s)]
*  Don't bother with him. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=817.6400000000001s)]
*  I'm not saying you should [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=819.24s)]
*  criticize his attacks on the bill [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=821.2s)]
*  or take the opposite stance. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=823.0s)]
*  But you've got others who are going [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=824.8800000000001s)]
*  to be voting on it that you need to [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=826.6s)]
*  lean into that specific issue. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=828.24s)]
*  That's the better strategy in [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=830.1600000000001s)]
*  my opinion. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=831.24s)]
*  Yeah, I don't see the difference [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=831.96s)]
*  at all. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=833.36s)]
*  Joni Earths says despicable things, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=833.8800000000001s)]
*  believes despicable things. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=835.6s)]
*  Same with half of Josh Hawley's [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=837.1600000000001s)]
*  position. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=838.6s)]
*  So we're encouraging them. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=839.12s)]
*  Elon says despicable things. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=842.1199999999999s)]
*  He thinks a couple of times he said [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=843.4799999999999s)]
*  things that are right in regards to [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=845.28s)]
*  the bill. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=847.1199999999999s)]
*  So I just don't see the principal [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=847.64s)]
*  difference at all. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=849.64s)]
*  And if I could get traction to [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=850.9599999999999s)]
*  Josh Hawley's effort to not cut [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=852.9599999999999s)]
*  Medicaid, I would love to do that. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=855.2399999999999s)]
*  And by the way, why not do both? [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=857.5999999999999s)]
*  Encourage Elon to cut the oil and [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=859.16s)]
*  gas subsidies, encourage Hawley to [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=861.4s)]
*  keep Medicaid as it is. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=864.0799999999999s)]
*  And so it doesn't make you [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=866.8s)]
*  complicit with every single thing [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=868.64s)]
*  that they believe, just to say yes [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=871.2s)]
*  when they agree with us. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=873.76s)]
*  It's so frustrating to me. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=875.6800000000001s)]
*  In law, Charlie Kirk, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=877.84s)]
*  did a poll give you a sense of how [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=879.12s)]
*  the right wing is thinking about [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=880.96s)]
*  over 100,000 votes? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=882.88s)]
*  Should the Senate immediately act [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=884.12s)]
*  and pass the big beautiful bill? [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=885.9200000000001s)]
*  And all of a sudden, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=887.6s)]
*  because of the fight, and [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUQyu4d16z0&t=888.5600000000001s)]
