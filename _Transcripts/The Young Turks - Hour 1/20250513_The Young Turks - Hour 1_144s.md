# Did Trump just call for a 'total reset' on his own tariffs? ðŸ¤”
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [May 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFwQcoA4NhY)
*  Good news, Donald Trump is off of his tariff rampage. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFwQcoA4NhY&t=0.0s)]
*  He's calling it a total reset. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFwQcoA4NhY&t=3.52s)]
*  Yesterday we achieved a total reset with China after productive talks in Geneva. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFwQcoA4NhY&t=5.36s)]
*  Both sides now agreed to reduce the tariffs imposed after April 2nd to 10% for 90 days [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFwQcoA4NhY&t=12.48s)]
*  as negotiators continue on the larger structural issues. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFwQcoA4NhY&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  What does a total reset mean anyway? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFwQcoA4NhY&t=24.0s)]
*  I think what Trump realized is, yeah, that didn't work at all. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFwQcoA4NhY&t=26.72s)]
*  So he's now resetting his own policy. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFwQcoA4NhY&t=31.119999999999997s)]
*  That's all. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFwQcoA4NhY&t=34.239999999999995s)]
*  Now Trump writes on True Social, no, no, no, no. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFwQcoA4NhY&t=34.879999999999995s)]
*  A very good meeting today in China, in Switzerland. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFwQcoA4NhY&t=37.44s)]
*  Many things discussed, much agreed to. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFwQcoA4NhY&t=40.64s)]
*  A total reset negotiated in a friendly but constructive blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFwQcoA4NhY&t=43.28s)]
*  Reparation made. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFwQcoA4NhY&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  Okay, sure, brother, whatever you say. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFwQcoA4NhY&t=50.72s)]
*  Okay, now the bad news. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFwQcoA4NhY&t=52.56s)]
*  No matter what happens, the US is going to maintain its 10% universal tariff on foreign import. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFwQcoA4NhY&t=53.44s)]
*  So the tariffs have not gone away. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFwQcoA4NhY&t=58.879999999999995s)]
*  And the still bad news, cars and steel from China are still going to be part of those tariffs, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFwQcoA4NhY&t=60.4s)]
*  so things aren't changing. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFwQcoA4NhY&t=64.4s)]
*  And remember, there's still a 20% fentanyl tariff, so overall China's paying 30%, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFwQcoA4NhY&t=65.67999999999999s)]
*  which means you're going to pay 30% more for all those goods coming in from China. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFwQcoA4NhY&t=70.72s)]
*  So you're going to enjoy that. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFwQcoA4NhY&t=75.44s)]
*  China is also going to ease non-tariff barriers. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFwQcoA4NhY&t=76.32s)]
*  We don't really know what those are yet because they haven't clarified it. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFwQcoA4NhY&t=79.68s)]
*  We hope that that's good, but so far no actual information. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFwQcoA4NhY&t=84.08s)]
*  But the good news, just kidding, there is no good news. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFwQcoA4NhY&t=88.0s)]
*  Trump says that if talks with China fall through, he'll just put the tariffs back up. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFwQcoA4NhY&t=90.16s)]
*  But that's not really good news. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFwQcoA4NhY&t=94.0s)]
*  Won't cause a problem in the first place. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFwQcoA4NhY&t=95.84s)]
*  And then he says, but don't worry, they won't be 145%. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFwQcoA4NhY&t=97.36s)]
*  Okay, they might only be like 132%. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFwQcoA4NhY&t=100.32000000000001s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFwQcoA4NhY&t=102.72s)]
*  That's so high, no one will buy it. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFwQcoA4NhY&t=103.76s)]
*  So of course, the main question though is how much are dolls going to cost? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFwQcoA4NhY&t=105.68s)]
*  Last month, the CEO of a company called Basic Fun said the toys this Christmas [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFwQcoA4NhY&t=109.84s)]
*  were going to be double in price. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFwQcoA4NhY&t=115.52000000000001s)]
*  His name is Jay Foreman. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFwQcoA4NhY&t=117.84s)]
*  I'm curious what he thinks now with the temporary reset. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFwQcoA4NhY&t=119.04s)]
*  And so it turns out Foreman did not hold back. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFwQcoA4NhY&t=122.08000000000001s)]
*  It's like they tried to feed us a rotten egg sandwich [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFwQcoA4NhY&t=124.88000000000001s)]
*  and hope we're happy to drink spoiled milk instead. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFwQcoA4NhY&t=127.36000000000001s)]
*  I don't really know what that means. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFwQcoA4NhY&t=130.0s)]
*  And it might be Basic Fun, but it's not actually basic English. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFwQcoA4NhY&t=132.24s)]
*  But overall, I think I get it, which is this still sucks. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFwQcoA4NhY&t=135.04s)]
*  I am curious. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFwQcoA4NhY&t=138.64s)]
*  What do you guys think? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFwQcoA4NhY&t=139.92s)]
*  Do you think that this tariff reset will actually last? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFwQcoA4NhY&t=140.95999999999998s)]
