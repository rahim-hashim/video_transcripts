"Israeli forces seized a Gaza-bound aid boat and detained Greta Thunberg and other activists who were on board early Monday, enforcing a longstanding blockade of the Palestinian territory that has been tightened during the war with Hamas.
The activists had set out to protest Israel's ongoing military campaign in the Gaza Strip, which is among the deadliest and most destructive since World War II, and its restrictions on the entry of humanitarian aid, both of which have put the territory of some 2 million Palestinians at risk of famine."*

# Greta Thunberg Blocked by IDF En Route to Gaza
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc)
*  My name is Gryffa Thunberg and I am from Sweden. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=0.0s)]
*  If you see this video, we have been intercepted and kidnapped in international waters by the [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=12.48s)]
*  Israeli Occupational Forces or forces that support Israel. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  I urge all my friends, family and comrades to put pressure on the Swedish government [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=22.8s)]
*  to release me and the others as soon as possible. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=29.32s)]
*  The Israeli Defense Forces have intercepted the flotilla carrying Greta Thunberg and other [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=33.4s)]
*  activists who wanted to symbolically send or deliver humanitarian aid to the Palestinians [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=40.0s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=47.900000000000006s)]
*  I say symbolically because clearly they didn't have nearly enough humanitarian aid to provide [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=48.900000000000006s)]
*  adequate assistance, but they wanted to send a message about the ongoing blockade of humanitarian [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=54.279999999999994s)]
*  aid into the Gaza Strip. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=60.839999999999996s)]
*  Now, luckily, no one was harmed by the IDF, which isn't something that I get to say on [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=62.44s)]
*  the show often, so I guess that's a bit of a win. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=66.75999999999999s)]
*  But the aid mission was organized by the Freedom Flotilla Coalition or FFC. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=70.12s)]
*  The group has been trying to end Israeli occupation and the blockade in Gaza since 2010. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=76.32s)]
*  Now 12 passengers including Thunberg and French lawmaker Rima Hassan were on board [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=83.56s)]
*  the ship. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  The Freedom Flotilla Coalition said the Israeli military had attacked and unlawfully boarded [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=90.12s)]
*  the Madeline, which is the name of the ship, which was attempting to deliver aid to Gaza [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=96.72s)]
*  where more than 600 days of war and an 11 week Israeli blockade of all aid has pushed [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=102.52000000000001s)]
*  the enclaves 2.1 million people deeper into a hunger crisis. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=108.72000000000001s)]
*  Now people might argue, well, what blockade? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=114.04s)]
*  I mean, Israel lifted the blockade. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=118.2s)]
*  You now have the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, an Israeli and US backed organization that's [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=120.08000000000001s)]
*  delivering humanitarian aid to the Palestinians. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=125.68s)]
*  They're luring hungry Palestinians to these humanitarian aid hubs and then shooting them, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=129.46s)]
*  upward of 200 Palestinians have been shot and killed as they are desperately trying [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=137.56s)]
*  to get food to feed their families, to feed their starving children. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=143.68s)]
*  Okay, so don't come at me with that BS organization that I think is just a way to like bait people [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=148.51999999999998s)]
*  to a specific place so they can be shot and killed. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=154.76s)]
*  That's what I think, that's what's happening. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=157.16s)]
*  We'll get back to that in just a minute. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=159.64s)]
*  Now last month, the world's top authority on food crisis warned of famine unless aid [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=160.92s)]
*  is allowed to enter the country. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=166.76s)]
*  One in five Palestinians are on the brink of starvation and Israel has since allowed [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=168.51999999999998s)]
*  some aid to enter the country, but not nearly enough, which we'll again get back to in just [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=173.72s)]
*  a moment. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=179.07999999999998s)]
*  But according to a statement released by the FFC, the group was carrying baby formula, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=180.07999999999998s)]
*  food and medical supplies, all of which were taken by the IDF, confiscated. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=185.11999999999998s)]
*  Now according to the FFC, the Malin came under assault in international waters and those [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=190.8s)]
*  on board were unlawfully detained. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=196.36s)]
*  Now look, I wanna be clear, the ship was definitely intercepted by the IDF. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=198.28s)]
*  They were not allowed to deliver humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=203.52s)]
*  I think that was the point, right? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=207.24s)]
*  I mean, this was meant to send a message about how far the IDF is willing to go, how far [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=209.16000000000003s)]
*  the Israeli government is willing to go to prevent the flow of humanitarian aid into [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=214.64000000000001s)]
*  the Gaza Strip unless it's being delivered by that Israeli and US backed organization [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=218.84s)]
*  that has been a complete and utter disaster for the Palestinians so far. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=224.52s)]
*  Now Adala, a rights group in Israel that said it was representing the activists, said Israel [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=227.8s)]
*  had no legal authority to take over the ship because it was in international waters and [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=234.96s)]
*  because it was headed not to Israel but to the territorial waters of the state of Palestine. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=239.8s)]
*  A state that Israel of course does not recognize. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=246.56s)]
*  They have not allowed the Palestinian people to engage in self-determination or to create [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=250.0s)]
*  their own state. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=256.52s)]
*  In fact, the Israeli government is currently in the process of annexing the West Bank, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=258.32s)]
*  which was not governed by Hamas and had nothing to do with October the 7th. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=262.64s)]
*  But October 7th was what Israel decided to exploit as their justification for the slaughter, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=267.88s)]
*  persecution of Palestinian people and of course the theft of their land, not just in [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=274.16s)]
*  Gaza but also in the West Bank. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=279.08s)]
*  Now the FFC stated that quadcopters are surrounding the ship, spraying it with a white paint like [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=281.32s)]
*  substance. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=288.92s)]
*  Communications are jammed and disturbing sounds are being played over the radio, which by [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=290.52s)]
*  the way can be seen in a live streamed video that was put out by the group. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=295.88s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=300.36s)]
*  Right now they're jamming our homes. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=301.68s)]
*  They're saying random stuff just to jam our communication. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=306.16s)]
*  Okay, they're dropping chemicals on us. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=309.68s)]
*  They're dropping chemicals on us. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=312.88s)]
*  We don't know what it is. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=314.88s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=316.72s)]
*  Okay, everyone take cover, please. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=321.76s)]
*  Take cover. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=323.52000000000004s)]
*  Incredible. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=326.08000000000004s)]
*  I mean, look, there was a non-zero chance that they would come up against IDF fire. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=327.04s)]
*  And I'm just I'm so relieved that that didn't happen. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=335.44s)]
*  But treating this flotilla that's just attempting to deliver humanitarian aid to the starving [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=338.64s)]
*  people of Gaza is just so sick in so many different ways. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=344.88s)]
*  And that was the point. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=349.36s)]
*  I don't think anyone on that ship was under the illusion that they were going to effectively [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=350.8s)]
*  end the blockade and be able to feed every single starving Palestinians. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=355.44s)]
*  They wanted to do something symbolic to show the world how far the IDF is willing to go [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=360.32s)]
*  to stop the flow of humanitarian aid to the Palestinian people. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=365.68s)]
*  Now, Israel's been against this organization from the jump. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=369.84s)]
*  As you all know, Israel's defense minister Israel Katz said on Sunday that I have instructed [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=373.36s)]
*  the IDF to ensure that the Madeline flotilla does not reach Gaza. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=378.4s)]
*  And his wish was granted by the IDF, of course. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=383.44s)]
*  And Freedom Flotilla Coalition claims that they did come under fire by an Israeli drone [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=387.12s)]
*  attack off the coast of Malta last month. However, I want to be clear they have not [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=393.2s)]
*  provided evidence of that drone attack or that that drone was an Israeli drone. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=398.16s)]
*  Israeli military, by the way, has refused to comment on it, which I find very suspicious. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=402.96s)]
*  And honestly, that lends a little bit of credibility to what's being claimed [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=407.84s)]
*  about the drone attack. But again, I would need to see some evidence of that before [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=411.92s)]
*  saying that it's true. Now, according to Madeline's seizure, Israel is essentially downplaying the [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=416.88s)]
*  entire situation, making themselves out to be the good guys. They're spreading photos [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=422.72s)]
*  where they're giving the activist sandwiches. But so far upward, again, of 200 Palestinians [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=428.32s)]
*  have been killed by Israeli bullets as they desperately try to get food to feed their [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=435.6s)]
*  families from the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation hubs. Now again, these hubs are backed by Israel [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=441.12s)]
*  in the United States, and people are getting shot and killed as they're desperately trying [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=447.76s)]
*  to obtain food. Let's take a look at one example. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=451.6s)]
*  That's the unmistakable sound of automatic gunfire. As crowds of Palestinians, some carrying food, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=454.24s)]
*  some still hoping to get, scatter from an aid hub in central Gaza. The Israeli military says [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=465.92s)]
*  it was firing warning shots. But a father of five lies dead. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=472.72s)]
*  They said Khalid was shot in the head by a sniper. He wasn't armed. They lie to people and tell them [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=478.32000000000005s)]
*  there is aid and then kill them. They are liars. And while these atrocities are ongoing in the [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=486.88000000000005s)]
*  Gaza Strip at the hands of the Israeli defense forces, as this has been going on for well over [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=492.96000000000004s)]
*  a year and a half, Israel Katz, the defense minister of Israel, of course, wants to basically [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=497.92s)]
*  punish the activists on that flotilla by brainwashing them, propagandizing them with [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=505.76s)]
*  the atrocities that were committed by Hamas. What about the atrocities you guys are committing? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=511.12s)]
*  Anyway, Katz announced on X Monday that he had ordered the Israeli defense forces to show the [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=516.96s)]
*  intercepted group the atrocities committed against women, the elderly, and children [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=522.24s)]
*  at the hands of Hamas on October 7th. And by the way, I think it's totally fine to [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=527.4399999999999s)]
*  acknowledge those atrocities. Those were atrocities. Innocent people were slaughtered [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=532.48s)]
*  on October 7th. There's no justification for that ever. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=537.52s)]
*  But since then, similar atrocities have been playing out by the IDF in the Gaza Strip, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=543.76s)]

*  Absolutely heinous supporters of ethnic cleansing and genocide. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=586.88s)]
*  And that's probably what motivated someone like Greta Thunberg to honestly risk her life [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbMJciADjc&t=593.1999999999999s)]
