"Former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard told the Senate Intelligence Committee she would "end politicization" of the intelligence committee and "rebuild trust through transparency" if confirmed as director of national intelligence as she seeks to quell wide-ranging concerns about her foreign travels, statements about Russia's war in Ukraine and her past skepticism of U.S. intelligence concerning things like Syria's use of chemical weapons on civilians."*

The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

What does it mean to be a ‚ÄúYoung Turk?‚Äù

According to the American Heritage Dictionary;
1. Young progressive or insurgent member of an institution, movement, or political party. 
2. Young person who rebels against authority or societal expectations.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

# Senators Make FOOLS Of Themselves During Tulsi Gabbard's Confirmation Hearing
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [January 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4)
*  Edward Snowden. Edward Snowden. Edward Snowden was a [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=0.0s)]
*  trader to the United States of America. Edward Snowden. Edward Snowden, Edward Snowden, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=5.44s)]
*  I agree with Tom Cotton, he is a trader. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=11.44s)]
*  Is Edward Snowden a trader to the United States of America? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  That is not a hard question to answer when the stakes are this high. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=18.8s)]
*  our senators are a joke and nothing made that clearer than how they handle the confirmation [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=23.76s)]
*  hearing of DNI director nominee, Tulsi Gabbard, that's director of national intelligence. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=32.0s)]
*  Now it seems like there really is bipartisan hatred toward Tulsi Gabbard, but what really [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=38.52s)]
*  stood out to me is the fact that they all kept asking about her views on Edward Snowden. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=44.42s)]
*  Now for those of you who are unfamiliar with Edward Snowden, he was the whistleblower who [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=50.48s)]
*  at the time alerted Glenn Greenwald about the NSA's indiscriminate spying of all Americans, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=56.18s)]
*  okay? That was a huge scandal, and he is not a traitor to America, if anything. He is a [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=65.12s)]
*  patriot who felt the need to risk everything in his life to let the American people know [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=71.92s)]
*  that the federal government was indiscriminately spying on all of us, all of us. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=79.60000000000001s)]
*  So truly, there's really no way that we can show you all the Snowden bashing coming from [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=86.56s)]
*  senators, but I do want to give you a little taste. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=92.56s)]
*  Until you were nominated by the president to be the DNI, you consistently praised the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=97.34s)]
*  actions of Edward Snowden. Some who I believe jeopardized the security of our nation and [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=103.2s)]
*  then, and I've had to flaunt that, fled to Russia. You even called Edward Snowden, and [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=109.4s)]
*  I quote here, a brave whistleblower, but Edward Snowden isn't a whistleblower. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=116.80000000000001s)]
*  And in this case, I'm a lot closer to the chairman's words where he said Snowden is [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=121.04s)]
*  quote an egotistical serial liar and traitor who quote deserves to rot in jail for the [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=128.08s)]
*  rest of his life. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=135.8s)]
*  Edward Snowden got mad at his employer that he didn't get the promotion that he wanted [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=137.4s)]
*  and started harvesting information and then found some things that he didn't like on it. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=142.79999999999998s)]
*  Why is he being treated like a folk hero by you instead of the traitor that he was? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=148.84s)]
*  We're gonna get to Tulsi Gabbard's answer in just a minute, which to be quite frank [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=157.79999999999998s)]
*  with you I wasn't happy with. But it is infuriating to see the bipartisanship pushing this narrative [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=161.14000000000001s)]
*  that Edward Snowden is like some demon that should be, I mean, they act as though he's [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=170.46s)]
*  like public enemy number one. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=177.94s)]
*  We were all being spied on, okay? The federal government was collecting data on every single [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=180.18s)]
*  one of us, regardless of what we've done, what we didn't do. It didn't matter. Indiscriminate [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=185.18s)]
*  spying by the federal government is an overreach of the federal government and Edward Snowden [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=189.56s)]
*  basically threw his entire life away to let the American people know about that. He should [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=194.48s)]
*  be pardoned, period. But that's, I don't know, it's unlikely to happen. What do you think, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=200.52s)]
*  Cenk? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=205.2s)]
*  Well, okay, so first to the senators, if I was in Tulsi's situation and they asked me [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=206.2s)]
*  is Edward Snowden a traitor? Easy, easy, easy answer. Hell no. You authorizing spying on [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=211.84s)]
*  Americans illegally, you're the traitor. You're the actual enemy. And the reason why you're [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=221.76s)]
*  so mad at Edward Snowden is because he let us know that you're the actual enemy. Because [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=227.5s)]
*  he told us what you wouldn't tell us, that you were spying in on us. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=233.48000000000002s)]
*  That's unconstitutional, it's illegal. And then you guys afterwards said, yeah, we won't [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=238.0s)]
*  do it anyway. And Edward Snowden, such a bad traitor for trying to protect your constitutional [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=243.12s)]
*  rights. No, he's not. Absolute American hero. It's the senators that are the goddamn problem. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=248.4s)]
*  And look at the unit party. All of a sudden, they're unified. No, spy, spy on the plebeian [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=256.32s)]
*  masses. How dare you support a whistleblower telling you to protect your constitutional [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=262.6s)]
*  rights. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=268.56s)]
*  Okay, now I turn to MAGA. I propose pardoning Edward Snowden. Almost all of MAGA agreed. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=269.56s)]
*  They loved that Tulsi Gabbard wanted to support Edward Snowden and support his pardon, etc. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=275.76000000000005s)]
*  That was part of the reason that she rose up with the right wing. And what happened [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=282.92s)]
*  to your Republican senators? I know you hate a lot of them. Well, this is the time to show [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=287.72s)]
*  it, okay? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=291.68s)]
*  Because these guys, and by the way, if you're a Democrat, also the same thing for you. Those [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=293.32s)]
*  Democratic senators are saying, let's go spying. Yay, spy on Americans. As a left winger, you [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=298.76s)]
*  should despise that. The people who initially said Edward Snowden was a hero were on the [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=304.56s)]
*  left wing, okay? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=310.28000000000003s)]
*  And by the way, this is not something that the left wing is hypocritical about. They [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=312.76s)]
*  have challenged Democrats and said that they were wrong, okay? Right wing, I know a lot [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=315.8s)]
*  of you believe this. Well, then show it, because we're not in charge. The right wing, unfortunately, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=323.72s)]
*  or unfortunately, I think unfortunately, but they think fortunately, you are in charge. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=329.08000000000004s)]
*  So if you're in charge, are you going to stand up and go, what the hell? No, we said Edward [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=333.6s)]
*  Snowden was a hero. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=338.24s)]
*  We meant that he's a hero. Stop kissing the ass of the Uniparty and pardon the guy. Are [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=339.44s)]
*  you going to put, by the way, not just about Tulsi, but are you going to put pressure on [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=344.96s)]
*  Trump? Or is that guy going to go another four years where everyone calls him a traitor, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=347.8s)]
*  including Trump? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=352.8s)]
*  So I want to go to Tulsi Gabbard and how she answered one of the thousand times that she [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=354.92s)]
*  was asked this same question about Edward Snowden. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=359.92s)]
*  It's a simple yes or no question. Do you still think Edward Snowden is brave? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=362.84s)]
*  Mr. Vice Chairman, Edward Snowden broke the law. I do not agree with or support with all [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=369.47999999999996s)]
*  of the information and intelligence that he released, nor the way in which he did it. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=375.35999999999996s)]
*  The fact is he also, even as he broke the law, released information that exposed egregious, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=379.88s)]
*  illegal and unconstitutional programs that are happening within our government that led [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=385.91999999999996s)]
*  to serious reforms that Congress undertook. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=391.67999999999995s)]
*  Is Edward Snowden a traitor to the United States of America? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=395.2s)]
*  He broke the law. Senator have confirmed as director of national intelligence. I will [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=398.64s)]
*  work with you to make sure that there is not a moment for social media in uniform. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=404.47999999999996s)]
*  Is Edward Snowden a traitor to the United States of America? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=410.64s)]
*  As someone who has worn our uniform in combat, I understand how critical our national security [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=416.34s)]
*  is. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=423.88s)]
*  Yeah, the traitors to the United States of America are sitting in Congress, okay, fattening [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=424.88s)]
*  their bank accounts through insider trading that ordinary Americans would go to prison [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=433.08s)]
*  for for a very long time. Okay, the traitors to America and Americans are the corrupt politicians [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=438.56s)]
*  who provide cover for a corrupt government that indiscriminately spies on Americans. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=446.12s)]
*  And when they've done absolutely nothing wrong, okay, it's just it's disgusting to see the [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=452.64000000000004s)]
*  bipartisan agreement on this issue. And the fact that they think they're so high and mighty [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=459.70000000000005s)]
*  as if they're not traitors to the American people when they're elected to serve the best [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=465.12s)]
*  interests of the American people, but they consistently do the opposite. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=470.36s)]
*  I can't stand these people. And honestly, I've said this before, I'm going to say it [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=475.08000000000004s)]
*  again, I've had issues with Tulsi Gabbard because I felt that she was dishonest about [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=479.92s)]
*  her political identity. And it turned out she was dishonest about her political identity, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=484.96s)]
*  pretending as though she was some progressive when in reality she wasn't. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=490.15999999999997s)]
*  But put that aside, even when she turned her back on progressives, she still maintained [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=493.08s)]
*  her positions on Edward Snowden on warrantless wiretapping. And I liked that she held those [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=498.48s)]
*  positions. I thought, okay, if she gets confirmed, at least there are some qualities to her that [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=504.92s)]
*  I find to be positive and helpful. But now she has turned her back on those values and [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=511.48s)]
*  it's beyond disgusting. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=517.32s)]
*  It's beyond disgusting how far human beings will go in an effort to accumulate power for [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=519.9200000000001s)]
*  themselves. And that's what we're seeing here. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=525.44s)]
*  Yeah, so I have a little bit of a more nuanced opinion on what Tulsi did there. So I want [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=527.76s)]
*  to talk to you about it in a second. First, Mikey3343 wrote in, member on YouTube, remember [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=533.28s)]
*  the time Anneth said she thought Tulsi was a secret right winger? Boy, was she wrong. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=539.12s)]
*  Sarcasm, yes. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=544.32s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=546.28s)]
*  It's almost as if I really do my due diligence and I research the crap out of everything [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=547.28s)]
*  I talk about before I talk about it. I know it's crazy. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=551.84s)]
*  Almost like we do on the show. Okay, so anyway, Mikey, we appreciate it, brother. Everybody [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=555.16s)]
*  hit the join button. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=558.32s)]
*  I do, Mikey, thank you. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=559.32s)]
*  Hit the join button below the video on YouTube to become a member like Mikey. All right. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=560.6400000000001s)]
*  So now, look, I would have had a much clearer answer as I told you earlier than Tulsi did. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=565.2s)]
*  Was she doing both sides? Yes, she was. And I've had a lot of criticism of Tulsi Gabbard [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=569.88s)]
*  as well. But Anna, I thought she was trying to give a nuanced answer there and go, hey, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=574.96s)]
*  yeah, he broke the law. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=579.88s)]
*  But on the other hand, he revealed important information, but they didn't really let her [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=581.34s)]
*  finish. And sometimes the senators interrupt because the witnesses taught to filibuster [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=584.44s)]
*  and take up as much of their time as possible. In that case, though, she wasn't filibustering. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=592.32s)]
*  She was actually trying to give her a real answer. Because, God, I already know it. Shut [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=597.2s)]
*  up, shut up. He's a traitor, okay? Let us spy, let us spy. We have to spy, we have to [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=600.8000000000001s)]
*  spy. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=605.44s)]
*  We hate the Constitution, but we're not the traitors. My donors want us to spy, but we're [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=606.44s)]
*  not the traitors. Edward Stone's a traitor. Okay, look, why do I say Trump's also responsible? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=609.92s)]
*  He's not responsible for calling him a traitor like the senators did. But he could pardon [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=614.92s)]
*  him today. He had four years to pardon him. And this time around, Magus said, whoa, he's [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=619.24s)]
*  definitely, definitely, definitely going to pardon him. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=623.8399999999999s)]
*  And instead of pardoning him, we got Republican senators yelling at his nominees, you better [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=626.36s)]
*  call him a traitor. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=630.36s)]
*  Look, who knows, who knows with Trump? It's not like he gives a damn what Republican senators [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=634.04s)]
*  think anyway, right? So he might pardon Edward Snowden. We have no idea. What I do know is [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=641.24s)]
*  he didn't pardon him in his first term. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=646.88s)]
*  And in fact, Donald Trump's Department of Justice was trying to extradite Julian Assange [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=649.36s)]
*  back to the United States so they could throw him in prison for the rest of his life. So [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=655.24s)]
*  That was a reality in the first Trump term as well, and it was beyond egregious. So look, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=660.3000000000001s)]
*  I hear what you're saying. She was trying to be nuanced, but you can't be nuanced during [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=666.26s)]
*  these hearings, unfortunately, because none of these senators are interested in hearing [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=670.3000000000001s)]
*  a nuanced opinion or nuanced take on an important issue. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=674.22s)]
*  They want yes or no answers. So what I would have done is I would have said he was a whistleblower [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=678.32s)]
*  and he drew attention to the fact that the federal government was engaging in indiscriminate [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=683.98s)]
*  spying of American citizens. Do you support that senator? That's what I would have done. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=687.9s)]
*  Yeah, well, that would have been way better and I agree with you, but they're coached [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=692.98s)]
*  to just get through this freaking thing. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=698.78s)]
*  So now we're all left with the hope that she's lying to the senators. That's what we have [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=700.64s)]
*  to root for. And that they're actually not going to continue to chase Edward Snowden [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=705.9399999999999s)]
*  to the ends of the earth. But there isn't much hope because Donald Trump at the end [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=710.22s)]
*  Does he really have a philosophical drive to free Edward Snowden? No, he'll only do [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=714.54s)]
*  it if MAGA puts enough pressure on him. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=718.98s)]
*  Otherwise, he couldn't care less about any other human being, let alone Edward Snowden. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=721.38s)]
*  And finally, I want to correct the record of those lying senators. Edward Snowden actually [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=725.22s)]
*  went through the right procedures first and the government was like, yeah, right, like [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=729.46s)]
*  we would give a damn. Of course, we're spying on them for purpose. Shut up, right? Then [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=734.6999999999999s)]
*  when he had absolutely no choice, he went to the press. Absolute hero. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol_nMiUYqn4&t=739.3s)]
