‚ÄúI‚Äôll be very honest with you, for the first time in my 100 days on this job ‚Ä¶ the other night I said to myself for the first time, I don‚Äôt know if I wanna do this anymore,‚Äù he said in a May 15 Zoom meeting of DNC officers, according to a recording obtained by POLITICO."*

# LEAKED AUDIO: DNC Chair Literally Crying Over David Hogg
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8)
*  Since they're engaging in this weird protection racket for ineffective loser Democrats, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=0.0s)]
*  yeah, your job is made harder when it doesn't need to be harder. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=5.92s)]
*  You should be welcoming challenges to ineffective Democrats. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  But they just wanna protect their buddies, even if their buddies are not good at their jobs. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=12.96s)]
*  I deeply respect you, David. I too was looking forward to working with you, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=17.92s)]
*  but this has created a situation. And I'll be very honest with you for the first time in my [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  100 days on this job. And the other night I said to myself for the first time, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=27.36s)]
*  I don't know if I wanna do this anymore. I'm just quite frustrated to be in this position. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=31.68s)]
*  You just heard the leaked audio that was sent over to Politico featuring Democratic National [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=37.2s)]
*  Committee Chair Ken Martin, revealing to fellow DNC officers that he's just not confident in his [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=43.76s)]
*  ability to lead the party because of infighting surrounding Vice Chair David Hogg. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=52.88s)]
*  So the audio comes from a May 15th Zoom meeting of DNC officials, Democratic National Committee, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=59.28s)]
*  of course. They discuss the ongoing conflict that ignited when David Hogg specifically announced [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=66.32000000000001s)]
*  that he'll be helping a separate PAC spend $20 million in safe blue districts to essentially [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=73.6s)]
*  oust ineffective Democratic incumbents. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=81.12s)]
*  Now, Martin has argued that Hogg should be required to stay neutral in races between Democrats. So if [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=84.48s)]
*  there is a Democrat who has decided to primary an incumbent, Martin argues we shouldn't take [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=91.12s)]
*  aside even though the Democratic establishment loves to take a side. It's usually the side of [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=99.04s)]
*  the corporate Democrat, usually the side of the incumbent who is a corporate Democrat. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=103.84s)]
*  But nonetheless, Hogg had pitched a compromise suggesting an internal firewall that would bar [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=108.24s)]
*  him from access to sensitive information in primaries his group, leaders we deserve, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=114.96s)]
*  were involved with, but Martin rejected that deal. So on the call, Ken Martin, who was elected just [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=120.56s)]
*  a few months ago, got emotional while telling his fellow DNC members that the feud is making [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=127.6s)]
*  it more difficult for him to effectively lead the party. Take a look. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=133.92s)]
*  The other night I said to myself for the first time, I don't know if I want to do this anymore. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=138.0s)]
*  And partly not because of the stress and all the naysayers, right? I'm used to that. I've [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=142.32s)]
*  spent 14 years as a chair. I'm used to getting beat up on. I'm just quite frustrated to be in [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=148.23999999999998s)]
*  this position because what you've done, whether you like it or not or know it or not, David, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=154.23999999999998s)]
*  is I'm trying to, no one knows who the hell I am, right? I'm trying to get my sea legs [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=159.51999999999998s)]
*  underneath of me and actually develop any amount of credibility so I can go out there [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=165.2s)]
*  and raise the money and do the job I need to to put ourselves in a position to win. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=170.88s)]
*  And again, I don't think you intended this, but you essentially destroyed any chance I have to show [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=175.28s)]
*  the leadership that I need to. So it's really frustrating. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=180.39999999999998s)]
*  Keith. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=185.68s)]
*  Keith. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=188.16s)]
*  Okay, so it's not clear who leaked this Zoom call to Politico. There have been some accusations [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=191.6s)]
*  lobbed at David Hogg, although David Hogg totally denies that he's the one who leaked it. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=200.96s)]
*  Now the clip does not include the whole conversation, so it's unclear how David Hogg [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=206.88s)]
*  even responded or how other members of the DNC responded to Martin's admission here. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=211.6s)]
*  But before I get to a statement from DNC officials who spoke to Politico to comment on the leaked [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=218.32s)]
*  audio, I want to get a sense of where you're at on this, Was. If you go on Twitter right now [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=224.88s)]
*  and you look at some of these right-wing accounts and the way that they talk about Democrats as [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=231.92s)]
*  soy boys and low-T and all of this kind of stereotype stuff, that clip that you just played [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=237.76s)]
*  encapsulated that. This dude is pretending that he can't get out of bed, he can't do his freaking [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=247.12s)]
*  job that he campaigned for, volunteered to do, he can't do his job because it's difficult. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=256.32s)]
*  Yep. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=264.8s)]
*  That's the message. My job is difficult and David, you just, you haven't contributed to [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=265.76000000000005s)]
*  making it easy. Come on, bro. Sack up, bro. Be serious. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=273.84000000000003s)]
*  I mean, we are in a heated political environment. We are in an environment in which the Democratic [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=280.8s)]
*  Party has no real identity other than taking on a more pro-corporate tone, abandoning the working [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=287.52s)]
*  class, leaning into identity politics, the detriment of their own party because they went [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=298.4s)]
*  too far and people got sick of it. Yeah, it's gonna be tough, Ken. Did you think it was gonna [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=303.91999999999996s)]
*  be a cakewalk to be the DNC chair at a time when, I think at this point for the first time in [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=309.12s)]
*  decades, registration of Democratic voters is lower than registered Republicans or the number [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=316.48s)]
*  of registered Republicans? That's a problem and it's because no one likes what you guys are selling. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=323.44s)]
*  It's gonna be tough because you need to figure out what Americans want. They're so out of touch. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=329.44s)]
*  You need to actually have conversations with ordinary Americans and to be quite frank, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=335.28000000000003s)]
*  I think the infighting in regard to primary incumbents is part of the problem. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=339.6s)]
*  Not because I'm against it, but because the Democratic establishment, Ken Martin included, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=344.8s)]
*  are trying to prevent it from happening. You shouldn't try to prevent it from happening. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=349.52000000000004s)]
*  It should absolutely happen. But since they're engaging in this weird protection racket for [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=352.8s)]
*  ineffective loser Democrats, yeah, your job is made harder when it doesn't need to be harder. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=359.12s)]
*  You should be welcoming challenges to ineffective Democrats, but they just want to protect their [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=364.64000000000004s)]
*  buddies, even if their buddies are not good at their jobs. Even if their buddies have not [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=370.4s)]
*  done a good job representing the constituents that elected them in those positions of power [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=374.88s)]
*  in the first place. Democrats are embarrassing, man, and I don't mean the voters. I wanna be clear. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=378.96s)]
*  I feel so much empathy for voters across the board because we're all in this terrible situation [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=383.59999999999997s)]
*  where we look at the two parties and it's like, I don't know. I'm too left for the right and I'm [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=388.79999999999995s)]
*  too right for the left. I'm in this weird place, politically speaking. But you look at the [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=395.52s)]
*  Democratic Party, I don't even know if they're too far left or too far right. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=400.16s)]
*  All I know is they're pro-corporate and anyone who wants to challenge them on that gets crushed. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=403.68s)]
*  So I think that's the heart of the problem, Ken Martin, but I don't know. What do you think, Was? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=408.88000000000005s)]
*  I mean, the heart of the problem is that the people who orchestrated the failures in November [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=413.12s)]
*  and previous in Joe Biden running again in 2020, Joe Biden refusing to get out of the race, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=420.96s)]
*  Kamala Harris's horrible campaign. The people who orchestrated that and presided over it [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=430.71999999999997s)]
*  are the very people stepping in front of any change happening at the top. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=440.32s)]
*  And again, these are the people that shepherded the party into at one point what was a 27% [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=446.32s)]
*  approval rating, an approval rating worse than Donald Trump's, one of the most historically [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=454.48s)]
*  unpopular politicians of our lifetimes, okay? Polarizing due to Democrats, okay? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=460.88s)]
*  Polarizing due to Democrats are polling worse than that, which means that half of their own [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=467.92s)]
*  voters, okay? It's pretty simple math. If 50% of the country, give or take, are Democrats, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=473.6s)]
*  and they're at 25% approval, that means half of their own people are sick and tired of them. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=483.52000000000004s)]
*  Again, the very same people who presided over the failure over this weakness are now saying, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=491.36s)]
*  no, no, no, you can't possibly wanna go against our instincts. We're so razor sharp. We're the [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=499.28000000000003s)]
*  ones that got us Trump. Why would you go against us? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=506.8s)]
*  Yeah, they really need to study the syntax. There hasn't been enough studying of the syntax, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=509.92s)]
*  and that might be the real problem here. So look, the DNC for the most part is rallying around [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=517.28s)]
*  Ken Martin supporting him. For instance, DNC Associate Chair Shasti Conrad, which is a great [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=523.8399999999999s)]
*  name, who attended the Zoom meeting and was briefly mentioned on it, said Martin showed [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=529.76s)]
*  vulnerability in a private conversation and stood up for the Democratic Party. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=534.64s)]
*  He shows up with authenticity always, she said. That's what you'll hear on the tape. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=539.12s)]
*  Look, I don't have a problem with him being vulnerable. I do have a problem with him failing [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=544.48s)]
*  to understand the current moment the Democratic Party is in, because his little infighting with [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=549.36s)]
*  David Hogg is just the tip of the iceberg. Okay, the fact that the Democratic Party has [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=554.08s)]
*  really lost touch with ordinary everyday Americans, that's a far bigger problem that will make his job [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=560.96s)]
*  far more challenging. Others who are on the call directly attacked David Hogg and called him a [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=566.4s)]
*  distraction. For instance, Jane Clea, President of the Association of State Democratic Committees, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=572.88s)]
*  said that instead of helping to rebuild the party he's supposed to serve, he's attacking it for [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=577.76s)]
*  personal gain. That might boost his PACS fundraising, but it erodes trust in the very institution we're [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=584.64s)]
*  trying to reform and strengthen. Now look, Jane, you need to be clear about how you intend to [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=591.2s)]
*  perform the Democratic Party, because I haven't seen any real reforms yet. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=596.88s)]
*  I've seen a super dorky effort to try to understand men where their initial findings, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=600.64s)]
*  they're weirdly surprised by. Looks like young men in this country are economically frustrated, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=607.1999999999999s)]
*  who knew? So embarrassing. And as for Ken Martin, he says he's staying put despite expressing doubts [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=614.24s)]
*  about his ability to be a leader in the Democratic Party. He says, I'm not going anywhere. I took [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=621.36s)]
*  this job to fight Republicans, not Democrats. As I said, when I was elected, our fight is not [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=626.08s)]
*  within the Democratic Party. Our fight is and has to be solely focused on Donald Trump and his [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=632.24s)]
*  disastrous Republican agenda. Democrats are cooked, they're totally cooked. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=638.48s)]
*  Look, I have no problem with you guys going after Trump when he does something wrong. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=643.2s)]
*  But that's all you guys have focused on over the last eight, nine years. You have to figure out [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=647.44s)]
*  what your party represents and what they wanna do for the American people. Unless you have a solid [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=654.48s)]
*  identity that appeals to the American people, the Democratic Party is cooked. It's that simple. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=659.6800000000001s)]
*  Everyone already has their views on Trump. They either love him, hate him, or aren't paying [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=665.36s)]
*  attention at all and aren't political at all. But this idea that they're gonna win elections by [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=671.52s)]
*  just constantly harping on Trump without offering voters something to vote for is ridiculous to me. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=676.8000000000001s)]
*  They're gonna keep going in that direction, apparently. Any final words, Was? [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=683.52s)]
*  This is just the stupidest thing I've ever heard in my life. I didn't come in here to [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=686.64s)]
*  fight with Democrats. I came to fight Republicans. Have you ever heard of the term rhino? [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=691.68s)]
*  This is why in our country, the tug of war only ever goes to the right. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=697.76s)]
*  In the Republican Party, when you're not sufficiently conservative enough, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=704.48s)]
*  you get killed, okay? You get smoked. That's it. We weed you out, you're out of here until we get [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=708.72s)]
*  a party that sufficiently represents the maximalist conservatism that we could possibly find out there. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=717.0400000000001s)]
*  There is no, no, we like the guys that are mealy-mouthed conservatives and can barely [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=727.9200000000001s)]
*  articulate what they like about being conservative or being a no. You get smoked, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=733.68s)]
*  and therefore our country only ever goes to the right. They don't elevate people who are [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=739.3599999999999s)]
*  quote unquote moderate. In fact, those are the people who are the most loathed in that party, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=744.7199999999999s)]
*  right? Whereas the Democrats want people want to pretend, and I think erroneously, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=751.76s)]
*  that they can be both for the good billionaires and normal working people. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=759.44s)]
*  Yep. This is the party. The Republicans, I mean, their whole thing is like, we're not gonna help [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=764.6400000000001s)]
*  working people, but you know, like- We're gonna pretend like we will, right? We're gonna engage [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=772.08s)]
*  in rhetoric, making it appear as though we have an economic populist strain within the party. But [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=778.8800000000001s)]
*  there has been absolutely no solid proof that what they're saying is true or is coming to [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=786.64s)]
*  fruition at all. Or even like in the ways that they're gonna help working people is like, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=793.04s)]
*  look, man, we're not gonna let your kids turn trans at school, right? [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=797.52s)]
*  To them, that's what they're offering the normal everyday working people were like, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=801.92s)]
*  make no mistake about it. We're here to cut taxes for rich people. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=806.4s)]
*  We're here to deregulate the hell out of the economy. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=809.52s)]
*  Republican who pretends he's not with that program, you are not going to be empowered [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=813.04s)]
*  within this party. And so the Democrats on the other hand, just don't believe in anything that [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=818.0s)]
*  they claim that their platform is about. They're not fighting for abortion rights. They're certainly [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=825.4399999999999s)]
*  not fighting for wage fairness for working people. Healthcare, I mean, like it's Bernie Sanders AOC, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=831.84s)]
*  and then what? Nobody seems to care about the health. They're a joke. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=838.32s)]
*  And so much is, cuz in America, left just means that you're vaguely racially progressive and gender [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=843.5200000000001s)]
*  progressive, I guess. The Democrats aren't a party of the left, man. They're a party of the corporate [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=851.7600000000001s)]
*  oligarchy power. And that's the direction this establishment seems to think is going to guarantee [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=858.88s)]
*  them victories going forward, even though it so thoroughly failed them in the more recent past. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pun8wDwMBf8&t=866.16s)]
