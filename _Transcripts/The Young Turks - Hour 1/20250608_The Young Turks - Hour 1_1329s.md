The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.
On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.
Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.
Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.
TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful.

# PROOF Netanyahu Wants US To Fight His Wars
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs)
*  While the last segment might have [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=0.0s)]
*  been somewhat satisfying, [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1.9000000000000001s)]
*  it was still heavy. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=3.52s)]
*  The stories about Gaza are [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=4.7s)]
*  difficult to cover. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=6.3s)]
*  But I wanted to kind of pivot over [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=7.72s)]
*  to the topic of a potential war [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  with Iran, which honestly, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=12.3s)]
*  the United States has been [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=14.38s)]
*  pressured to engage in, not just [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  over the last few years, not just [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=18.54s)]
*  over the last decade, but [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=21.0s)]
*  for literally decades. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=22.900000000000002s)]
*  Now oftentimes when we talk about [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=24.94s)]
*  Israel and how I believe that we're [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=27.56s)]
*  being pressured by Israel to go to [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=30.24s)]
*  war with Iran on Israel's behalf. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=32.58s)]
*  It's because I know too much, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=36.18s)]
*  I've seen too much. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=37.72s)]
*  And honestly Netanyahu can't keep [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=39.42s)]
*  his mouth shut. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=40.86s)]
*  So that's what this segment's [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=41.7s)]
*  about. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=42.98s)]
*  I want to put our current moment in [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=43.5s)]
*  historical context. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=45.46s)]
*  And with that being said, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=46.9s)]
*  let's get into it. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=48.42s)]
*  The Israeli newspaper Ma'ariv has [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=51.06s)]
*  reported Israel's former [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=53.379999999999995s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=55.26s)]
*  has publicly said the September 11th [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=58.1s)]
*  attacks have been good for Israel. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=60.52s)]
*  Netanyahu said, quote, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=63.06s)]
*  we're benefiting from one thing. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=64.64s)]
*  And that is the attack on the Twin [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=67.5s)]
*  Towers in Pentagon and [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=68.94s)]
*  the American struggle in Iraq. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=69.94s)]
*  Obviously we'd like to see [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=71.86s)]
*  a regime change, at least I would [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=72.78s)]
*  in Iran, just as I would like to [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=74.26s)]
*  see in Iraq. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=75.62s)]
*  The question now is a practical [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=76.66s)]
*  question. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=78.1s)]
*  What is the best place to proceed? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=79.1s)]
*  It's not a question of whether [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=80.66s)]
*  Iraq's regime should be taken out, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=82.26s)]
*  but when should it be taken out? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=83.94s)]
*  It's not a question of whether you [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=85.54s)]
*  would like to see a regime change [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=86.74s)]
*  in Iran, but how to achieve it. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=88.11999999999999s)]
*  That clip that you just watched [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=92.06s)]
*  featuring Israeli Prime Minister [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=93.94s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu was from [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=96.02s)]
*  September 12th, 2002, prior to the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=97.94s)]
*  US preemptive invasion and war in [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=100.53999999999999s)]
*  Iraq. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=102.78s)]
*  And interestingly enough, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=103.3s)]
*  he name drops Iran as he is [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=105.58s)]
*  encouraging the United States [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=107.58s)]
*  to go to war with Iraq. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=110.1s)]
*  Now, of course, Israel has [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=112.02s)]
*  an interest in the United States [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=114.02s)]
*  fighting a war in Iraq, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=116.22s)]
*  even though Iraq had absolutely [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=117.74s)]
*  nothing to do with 9-11. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=119.74s)]
*  And what we should do, and [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=121.42s)]
*  what I really wish our political [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=123.25999999999999s)]
*  class would be willing to do, but [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=125.5s)]
*  they're all too corrupt to do it, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=127.74s)]
*  is maybe consider the mistakes that [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=130.06s)]
*  were made in the lead up to [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=132.38s)]
*  the preemptive war in Iraq. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=134.18s)]
*  And how we were being goaded by [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=136.34s)]
*  the US and the US government [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=138.85999999999999s)]
*  and how we were being goaded by [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=141.1s)]
*  the likes of Benjamin Netanyahu to [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=143.46s)]
*  do that invasion based on a false [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=146.18s)]
*  premise. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=148.58s)]
*  Now, false premise was that Iraq [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=149.22s)]
*  had weapons of mass destruction. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=151.06s)]
*  Obviously, we did the invasion. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=153.14000000000001s)]
*  It was a complete and utter [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=155.14000000000001s)]
*  disaster. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=156.22s)]
*  There were no weapons of mass [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=156.74s)]
*  destruction. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=157.98000000000002s)]
*  And of course, everyone should be [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=158.86s)]
*  asking, why the hell did we invade [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=160.54s)]
*  a country that had absolutely [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=162.18s)]
*  nothing to do with 9-11 and [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=163.78s)]
*  really posed no threat to US [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=165.34s)]
*  national security, especially [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=167.02s)]
*  because they did not have weapons [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=169.06s)]
*  of mass destruction? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=171.42000000000002s)]
*  Now, the fact that they didn't have [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=172.94s)]
*  those weapons didn't stop [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=174.86s)]
*  Netanyahu from lying to the American [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=176.38000000000002s)]
*  people and the American government. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=178.5s)]
*  And when the US finally invaded [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=180.78s)]
*  Iraq in 2003, do you think the IDF [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=183.22s)]
*  joined us in that war? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=186.14000000000001s)]
*  No, they sat back. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=188.06s)]
*  They watched, they enjoyed. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=190.10000000000002s)]
*  As over 4,000 American soldiers [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=192.5s)]
*  died, they were killed. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=195.5s)]
*  Died, as hundreds of thousands of [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=198.10000000000002s)]
*  Iraqi civilians died. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=201.26000000000002s)]
*  So now we're thinking about [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=206.22s)]
*  a potential war with Iran. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=207.82000000000002s)]
*  Does Iran pose a national security [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=210.18s)]
*  threat to the United States? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=212.18s)]
*  No, they don't. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=213.54000000000002s)]
*  Does Iran pose a national security [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=215.86s)]
*  risk or threat to Israel? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=218.10000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, they do. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=220.34s)]
*  If Israel wants to fight that war, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=222.26000000000002s)]
*  they should fight that war, but [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=223.62s)]
*  Israel doesn't want to fight that [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=224.86s)]
*  war. They want you or [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=226.26000000000002s)]
*  your kids to fight that war. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=227.70000000000002s)]
*  They want you or your kids or [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=230.46s)]
*  your family members to pay for [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=231.94s)]
*  that war. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=233.34s)]
*  And that's a super strong statement [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=233.9s)]
*  to make, I get it. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=236.74s)]
*  Until you actually look into [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=240.22s)]
*  the history and the decades of [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=241.86s)]
*  statements and lies that have been [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=243.74s)]
*  uttered by Benjamin Netanyahu, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=245.78s)]
*  the current Prime Minister of [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=247.7s)]
*  Israel. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=249.3s)]
*  So let's get into that. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=249.86s)]
*  Israel's current Prime Minister [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=252.34s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu has been [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=254.18s)]
*  trying to convince the United [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=255.82s)]
*  States to fight its wars in [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=257.58s)]
*  the Middle East for decades, okay? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=259.06s)]
*  So in every instance that I'm [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=261.3s)]
*  going to show you, he lies and [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=262.94s)]
*  fear mongers about Israel's enemies [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=264.74s)]
*  allegedly developing nuclear bombs [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=266.98s)]
*  or having weapons of mass [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=269.18s)]
*  destruction. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=270.62s)]
*  And if you're wondering where the [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=271.58s)]
*  Bush administration got that idea, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=273.58s)]
*  who planted the seed that Iraq had [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=275.98s)]
*  weapons of mass destruction? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=278.14s)]
*  Look no further than Netanyahu, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=280.42s)]
*  as December of 1990 was already [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=283.5s)]
*  spreading lies about the threat of [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=286.42s)]
*  these Middle Eastern countries. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=289.46000000000004s)]
*  So here he is, this is December of [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=293.3s)]
*  1990 on the Today Show. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=295.5s)]
*  Let's hear what he had to say. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=297.82s)]
*  I think I've stated our policy and [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=300.46000000000004s)]
*  I think it's very much your policy. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=301.90000000000003s)]
*  That is, the question is really, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=303.86s)]
*  how do we ensure that these weapons [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=305.82s)]
*  of destruction, these missiles, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=307.86s)]
*  these chemical weapons, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=309.74s)]
*  the nuclear program that is [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=311.1s)]
*  fast accelerating in Iraq, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=312.62s)]
*  that these do not pose a threat in [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=314.22s)]
*  the aftermath of the crisis, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=315.98s)]
*  assuming he gets out of Kuwait. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=317.62s)]
*  This is an issue for [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=319.78000000000003s)]
*  the entire international community. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=320.5s)]
*  Saddam Hussein did not have [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=324.38s)]
*  possession of chemical weapons. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=325.46s)]
*  He did not have possession of [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=327.06s)]
*  weapons of mass destruction. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=328.5s)]
*  He was not developing a nuclear [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=329.94s)]
*  bomb. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=331.38s)]
*  That was a lie. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=332.1s)]
*  And just think about the timing [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=333.86s)]
*  here. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=335.34000000000003s)]
*  This is in December of 1990, okay? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=335.86s)]
*  So you have Netanyahu already going [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=339.82s)]
*  to work. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=341.58s)]
*  All right, how do we manufacture [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=342.26s)]
*  consent for war in Iraq? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=344.21999999999997s)]
*  Not a war that we Israelis want to [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=346.21999999999997s)]
*  fight, but we want to get Americans [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=348.06s)]
*  to fight it for us. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=350.06s)]
*  So he began planting that seed, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=351.02s)]
*  but it didn't take long for [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=352.86s)]
*  Netanyahu to use the same [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=354.34s)]
*  fear-mongering tactics when it [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=355.74s)]
*  came to Iran. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=357.58s)]
*  Here he is in his first address of [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=358.74s)]
*  a joint session of Congress. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=361.5s)]
*  This is in July, July 10th of 1996. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=364.21999999999997s)]
*  I was just 10 years old when he [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=368.86s)]
*  addressed a joint session of [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=371.26s)]
*  Congress in order to drum up [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=373.18s)]
*  support for a war. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=375.14s)]
*  Let's take a look at that. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=376.62s)]
*  The most dangerous of these [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=378.38s)]
*  regimes is Iran that has wed [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=380.38s)]
*  a cruel despotism to a fanatic [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=382.65999999999997s)]
*  militancy. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=385.21999999999997s)]
*  If this regime or [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=386.34s)]
*  its despotic neighbor Iraq were to [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=387.78s)]
*  acquire nuclear weapons, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=390.74s)]
*  this could presage catastrophic [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=393.09999999999997s)]
*  consequences not only for [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=396.14s)]
*  my country and [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=399.5s)]
*  not only for the Middle East, but [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=400.46000000000004s)]
*  for all of mankind. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=402.98s)]
*  Only the United States can lead [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=405.06s)]
*  this vital international effort to [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=406.78000000000003s)]
*  stop the nuclearization of [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=408.78000000000003s)]
*  terrorist states. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=410.3s)]
*  But the deadline for [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=412.1s)]
*  attaining this goal is getting [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=413.62s)]
*  extremely close. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=415.90000000000003s)]
*  The deadline is getting extremely [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=420.26s)]
*  close, bro, it's 1996. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=422.02000000000004s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=423.5s)]
*  In 1996, you have benched [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=425.78000000000003s)]
*  in Netanyahu say, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=428.06s)]
*  weapon of mass destruction, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=429.66s)]
*  a nuclear bomb is right around [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=431.94s)]
*  the corner. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=434.42s)]
*  We must do something about it. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=436.02000000000004s)]
*  We need regime change. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=438.06s)]
*  US invade, spill your blood, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=439.82s)]
*  use your treasure. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=442.82s)]
*  We're going to sit back and [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=446.66s)]
*  watch you do it. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=447.42s)]
*  We're not going to get involved, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=448.3s)]
*  but we're going to pressure you to [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=450.34000000000003s)]
*  do it. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=452.26s)]
*  And by the way, this is 1996, but [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=452.78000000000003s)]
*  this is before the Supreme Court's [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=455.02000000000004s)]
*  decision in Citizens United. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=457.34s)]
*  And Citizens United, I mean, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=460.5s)]
*  made our politically corrupt [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=463.26s)]
*  system so corrupt, it's on [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=465.9s)]
*  steroids, which creates an opening [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=468.53999999999996s)]
*  for foreign interests to have far [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=471.7s)]
*  more sway and influence over [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=474.29999999999995s)]
*  our politicians. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=476.46s)]
*  So back in the 1990s, you've got [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=478.02s)]
*  Bibi Netanyahu running his mouth [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=480.05999999999995s)]
*  about how yeah, Iraq and Iran, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=482.14s)]
*  they've got a nuclear weapon right [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=484.17999999999995s)]
*  around the corner. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=486.42s)]
*  We got to do something about it. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=487.3s)]
*  But no one was willing to pull [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=489.38s)]
*  the trigger probably because they [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=490.94s)]
*  hadn't been corrupted enough yet. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=492.65999999999997s)]
*  because remember, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=495.7s)]
*  the politicians aren't going to [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=496.3s)]
*  send their kids to fight that war. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=497.3s)]
*  They're not going to go fight that [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=498.46s)]
*  war. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=499.9s)]
*  Mark Levine's fat ass isn't going [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=500.42s)]

*  Your family members are going to [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=504.58s)]
*  fight that war. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=505.65999999999997s)]
*  Ordinary Americans are going to [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=506.26s)]
*  fight that war. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=507.42s)]
*  So a year, a single year after [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=510.18s)]
*  the 9-11 terror attacks, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=512.46s)]
*  the terror attacks that Netanyahu [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=514.86s)]
*  said were good for Israel. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=517.1400000000001s)]
*  Netanyahu testified before Congress [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=520.5s)]

*  to invade Iraq. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=523.9000000000001s)]

*  interests in that region. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=526.1400000000001s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=527.98s)]
*  The problem is you're not dealing [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=529.94s)]

*  Gaddafi. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=642.14s)]
*  Was it because we were concerned [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=642.7s)]
*  about the people of Libya? [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=644.9s)]

*  regime change in Iran, obviously [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=674.1s)]

*  Let's take a look at that. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=679.3s)]
*  So how much enriched uranium do you [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=680.5799999999999s)]
*  need for a bomb? [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=683.38s)]
*  I mean, it's a bomb. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=684.66s)]
*  How much uranium do you need for [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=685.94s)]
*  a bomb? [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=688.46s)]
*  And how close is Iran to getting [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=689.46s)]
*  it? [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=691.5s)]
*  They have to enrich enough high [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=692.0200000000001s)]
*  enriched uranium for the first [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=694.0600000000001s)]
*  bomb. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=696.1800000000001s)]
*  Where's Iran? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=696.7s)]
*  Iran's completed the first stage. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=697.5s)]
*  Took them many years, but [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=699.82s)]
*  they completed it, and [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=701.6600000000001s)]
*  they're 70% of the way there. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=703.2600000000001s)]
*  Now they're well into the second [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=705.58s)]
*  stage. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=708.3800000000001s)]
*  And by next spring, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=709.0200000000001s)]
*  they're going to be at the top of [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=710.62s)]
*  the world. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=713.2600000000001s)]
*  By next spring, at most by next [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=714.66s)]
*  summer, at current enrichment rates, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=716.8199999999999s)]
*  they will have finished the medium [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=719.78s)]
*  enrichment and [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=722.38s)]
*  move on to the final stage. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=723.5s)]
*  From there, it's only a few months, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=726.74s)]
*  possibly a few weeks. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=728.3399999999999s)]
*  That was September of 2012. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=733.78s)]
*  September of 2012, Netanyahu [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=737.06s)]
*  claimed, my God, Iran. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=739.38s)]
*  Months, maybe weeks, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=742.74s)]
*  away from having a nuclear weapon. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=744.18s)]
*  Think about it, big threat. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=747.66s)]
*  Okay, by the way, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=751.06s)]
*  the Iran nuclear deal that was [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=752.38s)]
*  secured by Obama and [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=754.46s)]
*  some of our allies wasn't signed [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=755.86s)]
*  until 2015. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=758.18s)]
*  So between 2012 and 2015, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=759.6999999999999s)]
*  there was no deal ensuring that [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=761.9s)]
*  Iran was not enriching uranium to [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=764.58s)]
*  build a nuclear weapon. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=767.46s)]
*  And in that time period, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=770.14s)]
*  they didn't have a nuclear weapon. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=771.42s)]
*  By the way, you want to know who [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=773.58s)]

*  When I was in grad school, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=795.1s)]

*  scientist that we would read about [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=799.38s)]

*  these weapons, these bombs, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=834.94s)]

*  no one would use them. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=840.22s)]
*  I think the rational states or [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=841.7800000000001s)]

*  a lot of heavy lifting there, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=846.5s)]
*  at least that's what I thought back [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=848.2600000000001s)]
*  then. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=850.22s)]
*  But Israel can't really bully its [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=850.74s)]
*  neighbors around if they have [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=852.7s)]
*  nuclear weapons, right? [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=854.3000000000001s)]
*  If mutually assured destruction is [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=855.94s)]
*  a possibility. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=858.1800000000001s)]
*  So this obsession with preventing [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=860.82s)]
*  its neighbors, with Israel wanting [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=862.9000000000001s)]
*  to prevent its neighbors from [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=865.0200000000001s)]

*  let's just dispel the notion that [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=869.0200000000001s)]
*  the Israeli government is concerned [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=870.94s)]
*  about Americans and our safety. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=873.22s)]
*  They couldn't care less. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=875.38s)]
*  The only use they see for us is [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=877.34s)]
*  their personal ATM account, so [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=879.1s)]
*  we can pay for their bombs and [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=881.1s)]
*  the slaughter of innocent people in [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=882.82s)]

*  But I just want to be very clear. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=887.66s)]
*  In 2012, Netanyahu said Iran was [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=891.26s)]
*  months, maybe weeks away from [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=894.8199999999999s)]
*  having a nuclear weapon, and [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=897.78s)]
*  that was a lie. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=900.6999999999999s)]
*  He told the American people before [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=904.06s)]
*  Congress that Iraq had weapons of [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=906.66s)]
*  mass destruction and [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=909.3s)]
*  chemical weapons, okay? [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=911.1s)]
*  They had nuclear weapons, [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=912.98s)]
*  we got to do something. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=914.66s)]
*  He lied, he lied, he lied. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=916.38s)]
*  By the way, what happened with [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=920.9s)]
*  Syria once Bashar al-Assad was [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=923.38s)]
*  taken out? [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=926.18s)]
*  Israel goes in, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=929.06s)]
*  they capture some territory. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=929.9s)]
*  It's not difficult to see what's [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=932.42s)]
*  going on if you're willing to be [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=934.46s)]
*  a naughty boy or girl and [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=936.54s)]
*  not listen to the mainstream media [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=938.1s)]
*  narrative in the United States [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=940.42s)]
*  about what's happening here. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=942.42s)]
*  Later in March of 2015, Netanyahu [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=946.66s)]
*  told a joint meeting of Congress [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=949.7s)]
*  that the Obama administration's [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=952.54s)]
*  decision to remove economic [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=955.66s)]
*  sanctions on Iran in return for [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=958.14s)]
*  Iran signing the JPCOA, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=960.9s)]
*  that's the Iran nuclear deal, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=963.06s)]
*  would have terrible outcomes, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=965.5s)]
*  terrible. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=967.74s)]
*  He said, Iran will become even more [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=968.5s)]
*  aggressive and sponsor even more [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=970.82s)]
*  terrorism when its economy is [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=973.02s)]
*  unshackled and it's been given [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=975.2199999999999s)]
*  a clear path to the bomb. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=977.5799999999999s)]
*  Except the nuclear deal, which [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=981.14s)]
*  wasn't just between the United [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=983.06s)]
*  States and Iran, it was between [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=984.8599999999999s)]
*  Iran, the United States, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=986.6999999999999s)]
*  Russia was part of it. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=988.3399999999999s)]
*  We had European allies who [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=990.0999999999999s)]
*  were part of it. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=991.42s)]
*  You have the international agency [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=992.9399999999999s)]
*  dealing with atomic weapons, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=995.2199999999999s)]
*  able to go into Iran to ensure that [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=997.26s)]
*  they weren't enriching uranium, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=999.5s)]
*  to ensure that they weren't [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1001.78s)]
*  developing nuclear weapons. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1003.6999999999999s)]
*  But Netanyahu hated the Iran [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1005.5s)]
*  nuclear deal, hated it, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1007.98s)]
*  absolutely hated it. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1010.3399999999999s)]
*  So in April of 2018, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1012.9s)]
*  Netanyahu claimed that he had [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1014.4599999999999s)]
*  conclusive proof of a secret [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1016.5s)]
*  nuclear weapons program that Iran [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1018.5s)]
*  had been hiding for years. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1020.98s)]
*  He wanted to show the evidence [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1023.5799999999999s)]
*  that he had. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1024.86s)]
*  So let's take a look at this [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1025.42s)]
*  laughable evidence that he's [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1026.98s)]
*  presenting. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1028.78s)]
*  Iran lied, big time. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1030.54s)]
*  After signing the nuclear deal in [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1036.3s)]
*  2015, Iran intensified its efforts [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1038.74s)]
*  to hide its secret nuclear files. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1041.54s)]
*  A few weeks ago, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1044.34s)]
*  in a great intelligence [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1045.46s)]
*  achievement, Israel obtained half [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1047.1399999999999s)]
*  a ton of the material inside these [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1050.06s)]
*  vaults. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1052.62s)]
*  And here's what we got. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1053.58s)]
*  55,000 pages. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1060.5s)]

*  Man, I really hope you transfer [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1074.86s)]

*  I mean, technology has been [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1077.94s)]
*  updated a bit. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1079.46s)]
*  Wow, you got some files and [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1081.34s)]
*  some CDs? [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1083.6599999999999s)]
*  That's not a bomb. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1085.58s)]
*  And there's no evidence of them [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1087.42s)]
*  making a bomb. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1089.42s)]
*  What is that? [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1091.98s)]
*  What is that? [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1093.3000000000002s)]
*  So that was what he said in 2018. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1093.8600000000001s)]
*  This is April of 2018. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1095.9s)]

*  few weeks later, May 8th of 2018, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1101.46s)]

*  of the JCPOA. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1107.18s)]
*  Which again, ensured that Iran [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1108.94s)]
*  couldn't enrich enough uranium in [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1111.38s)]
*  order to build a nuclear bomb. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1114.18s)]

*  diplomacy, okay? [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1119.6200000000001s)]
*  He wants regime change. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1121.8200000000002s)]

*  He likes it when he effectively [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1135.46s)]

*  who backed all of the regime [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1165.8600000000001s)]
*  change wars that we engaged in. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1167.7s)]
*  They're pressuring Trump to not [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1169.8600000000001s)]
*  pursue diplomatic means and [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1171.8600000000001s)]
*  get a new nuclear deal signed. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1173.5800000000002s)]
*  I have no idea what Trump is going [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1175.54s)]
*  to do, to be honest with you, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1177.1399999999999s)]
*  I'm not dumb, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1178.58s)]
*  I don't have hope in Trump. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1179.5s)]
*  But I do have some hope when it [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1182.42s)]
*  comes to a significant portion of [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1184.22s)]
*  his voters who don't want this. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1186.46s)]
*  I mean, take a look at Mark [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1190.06s)]
*  Levine's ex posts, goading Trump [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1192.18s)]
*  into going to war with Iran. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1195.26s)]
*  All the comments on those posts are [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1197.62s)]
*  Trump supporters and they all hate [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1200.46s)]
*  him. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1203.34s)]
*  And so if they speak up loud [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1206.02s)]
*  enough, honestly, [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1207.6599999999999s)]
*  I think there are only hope at this [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1208.94s)]
*  point in preventing a war with [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1211.02s)]
*  Iran. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1212.82s)]
*  But Trump's also very [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1213.32s)]
*  transactional, so who knows if he [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1214.82s)]
*  gets paid enough, he'll do anything. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1217.02s)]
*  Finally, I just want to give you [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1219.58s)]
*  something I came across that I [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1221.98s)]
*  think is pretty relevant to this [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1224.18s)]
*  discussion. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1226.58s)]
*  So back in 2010, a video emerged of [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1229.26s)]
*  Netanyahu speaking on camera, [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1231.82s)]
*  he was speaking to settlers in [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1234.26s)]
*  the West Bank, and he made some [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1236.42s)]
*  interesting statements. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1238.58s)]
*  A newly revealed tape shows Israeli [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1241.34s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1243.14s)]
*  once openly discussed his intent to [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1244.94s)]
*  attack the Palestinian government, [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1246.9s)]
*  undermine the Oslo peace accords, [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1249.06s)]
*  and manipulate the United States to [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1251.14s)]
*  ensure its approval. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1253.5s)]
*  The 2001 recording shows Netanyahu [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1255.8600000000001s)]
*  meeting with Israeli settlers in [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1257.98s)]
*  the occupied West Bank, addressing [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1259.94s)]
*  potential US opposition to Israeli [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1262.22s)]
*  expansionism. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1264.94s)]
*  Netanyahu says, and I quote, [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1267.78s)]
*  I know what America is. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1270.1000000000001s)]
*  America is a thing you can move [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1273.6200000000001s)]
*  very easily, [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1275.5s)]
*  move in the right direction. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1276.5s)]
*  They won't get in the way. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1279.3400000000001s)]
*  So now the real question is, [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1282.22s)]
*  is Donald Trump willing to get in [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1283.98s)]
*  the way? [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1286.1000000000001s)]
*  Or is he going to be a little bitch [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1286.7s)]
*  for Netanyahu like Bush was? [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1288.74s)]
*  because history doesn't look [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1290.7s)]
*  fondly at the Bush administration [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1293.18s)]
*  and what they got into. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1296.1000000000001s)]
*  And I know Trump is someone who [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1298.38s)]
*  actually really does care about his [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1300.3s)]
*  ego, cares about affection and [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1302.46s)]
*  validation. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1304.54s)]
*  So what does he want his legacy to [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1306.38s)]
*  be, that of George W Bush, or [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1308.14s)]
*  maybe something better? [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1309.82s)]
*  An American president who was [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1311.74s)]
*  actually willing to stand up to [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1313.5s)]
*  the government of Israel and [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1315.3400000000001s)]
*  the loathsome acts that they want [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1317.14s)]
*  our country to engage in. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1319.22s)]
*  I guess we're going to have to [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1321.6200000000001s)]
*  wait and see. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1322.26s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1323.1000000000001s)]
*  an angel gets a swings. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1324.6200000000001s)]
*  Totally not true, but it does keep [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1326.18s)]
*  you updated on our live shows. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1RdF123ajs&t=1327.74s)]
