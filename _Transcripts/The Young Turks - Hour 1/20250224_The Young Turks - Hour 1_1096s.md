The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

What does it mean to be a ‚ÄúYoung Turk?‚Äù

According to the American Heritage Dictionary;
1. Young progressive or insurgent member of an institution, movement, or political party. 
2. Young person who rebels against authority or societal expectations.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

# New Trump Polling Released, Is The Honeymoon Over?
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [February 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4)
*  51% of Americans think the mass [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=0.0s)]
*  firings of federal employees have [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=1.96s)]
*  gone too far. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=4.12s)]
*  And more than half of Americans [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=5.36s)]
*  think Trump is overusing his [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=7.1000000000000005s)]
*  executive powers. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=8.84s)]
*  So with all these firings and [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  executive actions, is voter [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=11.76s)]
*  enthusiasm for [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=13.42s)]
*  President Trump changing? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=14.44s)]
*  You might notice there's a lot of [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=16.46s)]
*  red on the screen and [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=17.6s)]
*  a lot of negatives. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=18.3s)]
*  Trump is underwater in all these [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=19.34s)]
*  polls, his net approval rating. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=20.66s)]
*  Look at this, minus five points in [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=21.76s)]
*  the CNN poll, minus six points in [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=23.36s)]
*  Gallup, minus seven points in [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=24.88s)]
*  Ipsos, minus four points [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=26.36s)]
*  in Quinnipiac, negative, negative, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=27.740000000000002s)]
*  and then negative. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=30.599999999999998s)]
*  Several new polls evaluating [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=32.04s)]
*  President Donald Trump's [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=33.68s)]
*  performance among the American [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=35.08s)]
*  people are out today. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=36.76s)]
*  And it does appear that the [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=38.0s)]
*  honeymoon is somewhat over for [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=39.879999999999995s)]
*  Trump. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=41.96s)]
*  Even Republicans are really split [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=42.96s)]
*  on how Trump is handling one issue [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=45.36s)]
*  in particular, right Cenk? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=47.68s)]
*  Yeah, and I am actually shocked by [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=50.44s)]
*  it, so I can't wait to get to that. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=52.44s)]
*  And on one issue, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=54.519999999999996s)]
*  he's nearly unpopular with [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=55.72s)]
*  Republicans. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=57.64s)]
*  With Republicans, yes. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=58.64s)]
*  So this poll was super [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=59.68s)]
*  interesting, but [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=60.92s)]
*  there's a new poll that also has [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=62.04s)]
*  Trump at relatively popular. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=64.0s)]
*  So there's lots of twists and [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=66.4s)]
*  turns here, but [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=67.64s)]
*  it's really important. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=68.36s)]
*  So you see the diversity of opinion [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=69.76s)]
*  within the country and [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=71.8s)]
*  apparently even within Trump voters. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=73.18s)]
*  So we're going to get into the [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=75.44s)]
*  details of two separate polls just [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=77.28s)]
*  to juxtapose them and the results. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=79.64s)]
*  The first one being the Reuters [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=82.16s)]
*  Ipsos poll that was out today. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=84.0s)]
*  Now according to this poll, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=86.2s)]
*  Americans think that Donald Trump's [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=87.84s)]
*  first month in office is a mixed [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=89.96000000000001s)]
*  bag overall. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=91.76s)]
*  For instance, here are the key [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=93.56s)]
*  takeaways from the Reuters Ipsos [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=95.5s)]
*  poll, only 25% of respondents [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=97.82000000000001s)]
*  support the United States taking [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=100.16000000000001s)]
*  over the Gaza Strip in the Middle [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=102.60000000000001s)]
*  East. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=104.96000000000001s)]
*  And by the way, that actually does [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=105.60000000000001s)]
*  include 50% of Republican voters [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=108.24000000000001s)]
*  also, so let's take a look at that. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=110.80000000000001s)]
*  All right, so this gives you [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=113.48s)]
*  the results of the poll. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=115.56s)]
*  Of the respondents in regard to [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=118.24000000000001s)]
*  resettling Palestinians, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=120.4s)]
*  aka ethnic cleansing. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=122.4s)]
*  And essentially the US government [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=124.12s)]
*  taking over Gaza, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=125.80000000000001s)]
*  among all Americans only 25% are in [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=126.72s)]
*  favor, 68% are against. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=128.8s)]
*  50% of Republicans are in favor, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=131.28s)]
*  while 46% are against. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=134.04000000000002s)]
*  You look at Democrats, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=137.28s)]
*  only 9% are in favor, 88% against. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=138.6s)]
*  And individuals who identify as [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=141.16s)]
*  other, meaning independents, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=143.6s)]
*  non-affiliated voters. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=146.16000000000003s)]
*  Among those, 19% support the idea [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=148.72s)]
*  of taking over Gaza, Cenk. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=150.8s)]
*  Yeah, real quick on this one, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=152.48000000000002s)]
*  because this was so important. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=154.24s)]
*  Told you on several grounds, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=156.20000000000002s)]
*  steeply unpopular to support Israel [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=158.36s)]
*  on Gaza, only 25% of the country [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=161.04000000000002s)]
*  agrees. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=163.56s)]
*  But yet Joe Biden and Kamala Harris [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=165.12s)]
*  walk that plank anyway. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=166.92000000000002s)]
*  Now Donald Trump is in the middle [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=168.60000000000002s)]
*  of walking that plank. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=170.04000000000002s)]
*  And Donald Trump, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=171.16000000000003s)]
*  unlike the Democrats, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=171.96s)]
*  loves to be popular. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=172.92000000000002s)]
*  But yet he's willing to be unpopular [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=174.8s)]
*  if you give him $337 million as [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=177.08s)]
*  the Adelson family has, let alone [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=179.24s)]
*  all the money from AIPAC, etc. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=181.4s)]
*  Second of all, told you, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=183.32s)]
*  independents hate the idea of [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=185.1s)]
*  financing this genocide down at 19%. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=187.32s)]
*  I mean, what Biden and [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=190.28s)]
*  Kamala Harris did was political [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=192.24s)]
*  malpractice to not change their [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=194.92000000000002s)]
*  position on that just for [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=197.32s)]
*  their donors sake. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=199.12s)]
*  Now the political malpractice is [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=200.72s)]
*  on Trump. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=202.04s)]
*  The only thing I can say that told [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=202.76s)]
*  you is, I told you that the right [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=204.79999999999998s)]
*  wing voters didn't want to go into [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=206.76s)]
*  Gaza and put boots on the ground. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=208.96s)]
*  And there's half of them going, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=211.28s)]
*  what the hell is this? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=213.04s)]
*  No, no, we don't want to do that. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=214.4s)]
*  In fact, Reuters spoke to one [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=216.79999999999998s)]
*  Republican lawyer, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=218.44s)]
*  his name's Willard Moore, and [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=219.76s)]
*  I thought his quote was interesting. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=221.48s)]
*  He says, I thought that, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=223.44s)]
*  meaning taking over Gaza, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=224.79999999999998s)]
*  was a moronic idea, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=226.32s)]
*  because it's infeasible. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=227.6s)]
*  If you did it, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=229.64s)]
*  it would cost a lot of money, and [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=230.32s)]
*  you have some sort of resort? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=232.12s)]
*  What good is that for anyone? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=234.24s)]
*  I love that comment, and [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=237.12s)]
*  obviously it would be insanely [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=239.0s)]
*  cruel to displace millions of [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=241.36s)]
*  Palestinians who have the right to [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=243.68s)]
*  that land. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=246.32000000000002s)]
*  But going back to the Reuters [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=247.68s)]
*  Ipsos poll, obviously the [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=249.28s)]
*  respondents were asked about other [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=250.84s)]
*  areas of the Trump administration [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=252.92000000000002s)]
*  thus far. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=255.0s)]
*  Now only 32% approve of Trump's [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=255.72000000000003s)]
*  handling of inflation, which, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=258.52000000000004s)]
*  look, I get it. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=262.08s)]
*  The data that we recently delved [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=263.35999999999996s)]
*  into in regard to inflation being [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=266.0s)]
*  stickier, unfortunately going up [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=268.64s)]
*  a little bit in recent months, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=271.59999999999997s)]
*  relied on data from January. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=274.0s)]
*  So it's easy to misrepresent that [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=276.96s)]
*  and put that on Trump. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=279.4s)]
*  But look, in my opinion, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=281.32s)]
*  it's too early to judge him too [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=283.2s)]
*  harshly on how he's handling [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=285.32s)]
*  inflation. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=287.23999999999995s)]
*  With that said though, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=288.0s)]
*  he has been lowering expectations [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=290.08s)]
*  in regard to lowering inflation in [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=293.16s)]
*  recent weeks through interviews, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=296.12s)]
*  through posts on social media. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=298.96000000000004s)]
*  It's almost as if he wanted to run [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=301.92s)]
*  on the issue, but now that he's in [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=303.40000000000003s)]
*  power, doesn't really want to [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=304.88s)]
*  focus on lowering inflation and [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=306.36s)]
*  following through on that specific [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=307.96000000000004s)]
*  promise. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=309.8s)]
*  To which I say, of course. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=310.92s)]
*  And so the inflation issue goes to [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=313.36s)]
*  back to the bubbles. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=315.64s)]
*  So in the Democratic bubble, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=317.32s)]
*  pre-election, what do you mean? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=319.44s)]
*  We have a great economy, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=320.96000000000004s)]
*  the stock market's up, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=321.92s)]
*  unemployment is low. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=322.84000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, inflation is a little bit of [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=324.40000000000003s)]
*  a problem. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=325.64s)]
*  And we're like, yeah, maybe it's [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=325.96000000000004s)]
*  a little bit of a problem if you're [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=327.36s)]
*  super rich and live in Washington. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=328.8s)]
*  But it's a massive problem in [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=330.68s)]
*  the rest of the country. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=332.08000000000004s)]
*  And if you ignore it, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=333.12s)]
*  you'll run right into that brick [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=334.40000000000003s)]
*  wall, and that's what happened. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=336.24s)]
*  So now in the Republican bubble, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=337.64s)]
*  they're like, it's okay, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=339.28000000000003s)]
*  the country loves Doge. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=340.68s)]
*  And they want to do all these cuts [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=342.2s)]
*  and everything's going great. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=344.12s)]
*  So it's panelling inflation is not [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=346.12s)]
*  that big a deal. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=349.04s)]
*  And the American people are like, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=350.68s)]
*  no, I don't know what it's going to [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=352.24s)]
*  take to get through your thick [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=353.88s)]
*  heads, all of you guys on the [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=355.24s)]
*  Democratic and Republican side. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=356.48s)]
*  It's a big deal, because that [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=357.8s)]
*  affects our lives more than [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=359.92s)]
*  anything else. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=361.84s)]
*  I just wanted to go buy eggs, and [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=363.2s)]
*  I was like, god damn it, right? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=364.72s)]
*  That's what normal people go [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=366.56s)]
*  through when they go shopping. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=368.0s)]
*  And now Trump is pulling a Biden on [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=369.6s)]
*  that, and it's going to be [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=371.36s)]
*  a disaster for him. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=372.68s)]
*  And guys, the other part of [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=373.8s)]
*  the problem is, they don't actually [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=374.8s)]
*  have a plan to help any Americans. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=376.32s)]
*  They have a plan for [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=378.20000000000005s)]
*  trillions in tax cuts. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=379.20000000000005s)]
*  They never had a plan to lower [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=381.0s)]
*  inflation. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=382.32000000000005s)]
*  That's the core of the problem. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=383.32000000000005s)]
*  I want to go to graphic four so [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=384.92s)]
*  we can discuss what the Reuters [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=386.68s)]
*  Ipsos poll found on Americans [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=388.6s)]
*  approval of Doge. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=390.6s)]
*  And as you can see by the numbers [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=392.56s)]
*  here, well, a lot of Americans not [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=394.56s)]
*  in favor of it. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=397.08000000000004s)]
*  Among all adults, only 42% are in [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=398.32000000000005s)]
*  favor of what the Department of [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=400.52000000000004s)]
*  Government efficiency is up to, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=402.36s)]
*  53% disapprove. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=404.32000000000005s)]
*  Republicans obviously find it [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=407.08s)]
*  a lot more appealing. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=409.24s)]
*  So 82% of Republicans approve of [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=411.15999999999997s)]
*  what Doge is doing, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=413.36s)]
*  only 16% disapprove. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=414.68s)]
*  9% of Democrats approve, well, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=416.88s)]
*  90% of Democrats disapprove. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=419.15999999999997s)]
*  And in the other category, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=421.48s)]
*  you have 38% of respondents saying [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=422.92s)]
*  that they approve of what Doge is [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=424.8s)]
*  doing. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=426.56s)]
*  So vast majority of Democrats [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=427.08s)]
*  against it, vast majority of [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=428.88s)]
*  Republicans in favor of it. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=430.6s)]
*  What really might make the [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=432.64s)]
*  difference for someone like Donald [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=433.88s)]
*  is whether the independent voters [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=435.79999999999995s)]
*  and their distaste for [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=437.91999999999996s)]
*  what's happening in regard to Doge [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=439.35999999999996s)]
*  ends up lowering his approval [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=441.52s)]
*  rating overall. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=443.35999999999996s)]
*  I'll make a quick prediction on [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=444.79999999999995s)]
*  that. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=446.56s)]
*  That number is already lowered 42%, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=447.08s)]
*  independence 38%, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=449.56s)]
*  it's a really bad number. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=450.91999999999996s)]
*  So hey, is it going to recover? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=452.84s)]
*  And by the way, we have a poll in [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=455.35999999999996s)]
*  the live chat, shows live 68 PM, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=457.15999999999997s)]
*  Eastern every day, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=459.12s)]
*  Monday through Friday. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=460.15999999999997s)]
*  And we're asking if Trump's numbers [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=461.64s)]
*  are going to go up or not. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=463.96s)]
*  In the case of Doge, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=466.64s)]
*  my bold prediction is they will [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=468.04s)]
*  only go down, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=470.04s)]
*  they will not come back up. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=471.08s)]
*  Because what's going to happen [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=473.32s)]
*  next is you're going to hear more [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=474.92s)]
*  and more stories of how dumb these [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=476.6s)]
*  cuts were. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=478.4s)]
*  I don't mean making any cuts as [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=479.6s)]
*  dumb, there's actually a ton of [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=480.96s)]
*  waste in the government. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=482.36s)]
*  I mean, the way they did this, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=483.92s)]
*  a blind hatchet, let's just chop [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=485.32s)]
*  things off. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=486.96s)]
*  And who cares if they're veterans, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=488.24s)]
*  who cares if they're working on [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=489.88s)]
*  cancer research, who cares on how [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=491.28s)]
*  we do? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=492.84s)]
*  And by the way, and [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=494.03999999999996s)]
*  that's in a good case scenario. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=494.79999999999995s)]
*  In a bad case scenario, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=496.28s)]
*  they really screw something up and [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=497.44s)]
*  they don't send Medicaid payments [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=499.12s)]
*  or something. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=500.84s)]
*  And then you're going to have that [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=501.88s)]
*  number in the teens. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=503.44s)]
*  So it's not going to ever recover [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=504.67999999999995s)]
*  because they're doing it in [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=506.35999999999996s)]
*  a way that's reckless. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=507.67999999999995s)]
*  It's reckless in that they're just [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=509.03999999999996s)]
*  kind of wiping out federal workers [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=511.23999999999995s)]
*  who are on probation. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=513.56s)]
*  So probationary federal workers, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=515.12s)]
*  they're usually on probation for [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=517.0799999999999s)]
*  about two years. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=518.8s)]
*  And so the idea is these are brand [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=520.04s)]
*  new federal workers, do we really [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=521.56s)]
*  want to do them anyway? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=523.16s)]
*  But also keep in mind that federal [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=524.04s)]
*  workers who are promoted are on [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=526.48s)]
*  probation in their new position. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=528.84s)]
*  And think about it, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=531.72s)]
*  they've been promoted. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=532.76s)]
*  Meaning, they've done a good job [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=534.24s)]
*  and there was reason for them to be [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=536.0s)]
*  promoted and their individuals who [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=537.64s)]
*  are experienced in the government [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=539.4s)]
*  agencies that they're employed by. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=540.92s)]
*  And so that's how a lot of these [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=542.64s)]
*  mistakes are being made. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=544.12s)]
*  It's just this indiscriminate [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=545.24s)]
*  firing of probationary federal [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=547.32s)]
*  workers. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=549.28s)]
*  And by the way, some of those [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=550.28s)]
*  federal workers, and [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=551.72s)]
*  a lot of them apparently are [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=552.88s)]
*  Republicans, and certainly a ton of [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=554.08s)]
*  them are independents. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=555.6800000000001s)]
*  And so now you're losing all the [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=557.08s)]
*  votes of all of their, not just [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=558.8000000000001s)]
*  them, but all their families. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=560.5600000000001s)]
*  So this is politically and for [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=562.6s)]
*  both politically and [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=564.5600000000001s)]
*  from a policy perspective, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=565.88s)]
*  clearly the wrong way to go about [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=567.6800000000001s)]
*  it even if you believe in Doge, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=569.64s)]
*  this is the dumb way to do it. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=571.5600000000001s)]
*  Now, I want to give you one [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=574.0s)]
*  statement from a Republican that [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=575.2800000000001s)]
*  Reuters spoke to. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=576.88s)]
*  His name is Gerald Dunn and [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=577.72s)]
*  in regard to the cuts on federal [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=579.52s)]
*  employees, he says, he's just [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=581.6s)]
*  rushing a little bit. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=583.48s)]
*  I think the whole thing with the [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=584.5600000000001s)]
*  Doge is being rushed a little bit. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=586.44s)]
*  I like what he's doing, but [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=589.28s)]
*  I think a lot of what he says is [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=590.88s)]
*  just BS. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=592.72s)]
*  When he starts talking about [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=593.8000000000001s)]
*  annexing Greenland and [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=595.3000000000001s)]
*  annexing Canada, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=596.52s)]
*  you know that's just smoke. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=597.64s)]
*  So Gerald Dunn likes the idea of [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=599.44s)]
*  getting rid of waste, fraud, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=601.32s)]
*  and abuse. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=603.16s)]
*  I like the idea of getting rid of [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=604.52s)]
*  waste, fraud, and abuse. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=606.2s)]
*  I have no qualms with anybody who [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=607.5600000000001s)]
*  says that that exists. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=609.4s)]
*  I think it does exist within [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=610.8399999999999s)]
*  the federal government. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=612.0799999999999s)]
*  You just have to do a better review [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=613.3599999999999s)]
*  and have a better method of rooting [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=615.3599999999999s)]
*  out where the waste is instead of [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=617.52s)]
*  indiscriminately firing [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=619.3199999999999s)]
*  probationary federal workers. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=620.76s)]
*  All right, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=623.0799999999999s)]
*  let's go to immigration now. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=623.5999999999999s)]
*  So this is graphic six where you're [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=625.12s)]
*  going to see how Americans are [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=627.52s)]
*  judging how Donald Trump has [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=629.56s)]
*  handled the issue of immigration. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=631.52s)]
*  55% of Americans are in favor of [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=634.12s)]
*  increasing the deportation of [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=636.68s)]
*  people who are in the United [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=639.64s)]
*  States illegally. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=641.62s)]
*  Among Republicans, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=643.56s)]
*  that number is 89% among Democrats, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=645.04s)]
*  much lower at 24% with 74% [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=647.68s)]
*  disapproving of that idea. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=649.8s)]
*  And so this is really interesting [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=653.28s)]
*  because while the majority of [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=655.4399999999999s)]
*  Americans are in favor of [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=657.4399999999999s)]
*  increasing deportations, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=659.1999999999999s)]
*  turns out that Americans are not [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=661.24s)]
*  happy with how Trump is carrying [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=663.4399999999999s)]
*  this out. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=665.6s)]
*  So let's go to graphic seven here [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=666.1999999999999s)]
*  where across all respondents in [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=668.04s)]
*  the Reuters Ipsos poll just over [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=669.92s)]
*  half, 55% supported increasing [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=671.84s)]
*  deportations compared to 41% who [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=673.8s)]
*  were opposed. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=675.88s)]
*  But Trump's performance on [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=676.6s)]
*  immigration was approved by less [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=678.48s)]
*  than half of respondents at 47%. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=680.72s)]
*  So what do you think [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=683.96s)]
*  is happening there? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=684.84s)]
*  Yeah, so I don't think that [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=686.2s)]
*  the voters were unclear. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=687.76s)]
*  They wanted to stop illegal [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=689.44s)]
*  immigration. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=691.28s)]
*  So they said it in every poll and [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=692.44s)]
*  it was one of the top three issues [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=694.44s)]
*  in every single poll. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=696.72s)]
*  So they're still sticking with [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=698.84s)]
*  their position. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=700.48s)]
*  But both on that issue and [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=701.6s)]
*  throughout all these issues, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=703.1999999999999s)]
*  what you're seeing in the polling [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=705.3199999999999s)]
*  is, yeah, we asked you to do it, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=707.36s)]
*  but we didn't ask you to do it in [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=709.3199999999999s)]
*  a maniacal way. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=711.08s)]
*  We didn't ask you to do it in [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=712.56s)]
*  a super draconian way. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=713.84s)]
*  We didn't ask you to take a hatchet [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=715.3199999999999s)]
*  to things that need a scalpel, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=717.0s)]
*  right? [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=718.56s)]
*  We didn't ask you to cut [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=719.12s)]
*  everything. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=720.92s)]
*  We asked you to cut the things that [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=722.2s)]
*  are problematic. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=724.76s)]
*  We asked you to control the border. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=726.52s)]
*  We didn't ask you to drag people [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=728.44s)]
*  out of their houses, etc. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=729.88s)]
*  Now they haven't done that much of [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=731.44s)]
*  it. They've gone after [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=732.8000000000001s)]
*  undocumented criminals so far, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=734.24s)]
*  mainly. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=736.6s)]
*  And so I'm a little bit surprised [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=738.44s)]
*  that how he's handling immigration [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=740.72s)]
*  is already a little bit unpopular. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=743.2s)]
*  So but that's the good news because [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=746.28s)]
*  it might provide, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=748.36s)]
*  the polling is good news. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=749.5600000000001s)]
*  because it might provide a break [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=751.0s)]
*  in the Trump administration. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=752.72s)]
*  It might not, but [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=754.2s)]
*  I look at it and go, wow. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=755.04s)]
*  Yeah, if we go further and [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=756.76s)]
*  we start going after people who [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=758.04s)]
*  are not criminals, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=759.44s)]
*  this is going to get really [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=760.4s)]
*  unpopular. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=761.84s)]
*  Everybody always, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=763.72s)]
*  well, that's not true. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=764.8s)]
*  The Democrats, I was about to say [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=766.08s)]
*  everybody overreads their mandate. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=767.56s)]
*  No, the Republicans [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=769.8s)]
*  overread their mandate. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=770.68s)]
*  The Democrats under read their [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=771.96s)]
*  mandate. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=773.84s)]
*  Yeah, and look, I want to be clear [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=774.6s)]
*  like Cenk is speculating. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=776.72s)]
*  We don't know why the respondents [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=778.56s)]
*  to the Reuters poll are unhappy [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=780.52s)]
*  with how Donald Trump is carrying [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=782.24s)]
*  out the immigration policies. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=784.28s)]
*  But I should note this. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=785.96s)]
*  So a federal judge and [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=787.52s)]
*  we're going to do a longer story on [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=788.36s)]
*  this in just a minute. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=789.68s)]
*  But a federal judge has just [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=790.32s)]
*  blocked Donald Trump's unlawful and [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=792.0s)]
*  harmful immigration raids [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=794.44s)]
*  at houses of worship. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=796.24s)]
*  So early on in this [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=798.12s)]
*  administration, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=799.48s)]
*  we heard from Tom Homan who is [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=800.96s)]
*  Donald Trump's border czar. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=802.96s)]
*  That they will in fact, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=804.5600000000001s)]
*  go into churches or places of [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=806.36s)]
*  worship if necessary in order to [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=808.4s)]
*  carry out deportations. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=810.72s)]
*  But a federal judge has stepped in [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=813.16s)]
*  and said no, that actually goes [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=815.0799999999999s)]
*  against religious liberty and [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=816.9599999999999s)]
*  constitutional protections for [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=818.76s)]
*  religious liberty in America. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=820.68s)]
*  I'm unclear as to whether the Trump [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=823.3199999999999s)]
*  administration is going to appeal [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=824.8399999999999s)]
*  or challenge that decision by [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=826.28s)]
*  the federal judge. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=827.68s)]
*  But nonetheless, I do think that [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=828.8s)]
*  most people in America get super [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=830.76s)]
*  uncomfortable when you start [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=832.64s)]
*  talking about ICE agents raiding [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=834.28s)]
*  places of worship in order to [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=836.0799999999999s)]
*  carry out deportations. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=837.64s)]
*  Now I want to juxtapose this [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=839.24s)]
*  Reuters Ipsos poll, which was [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=841.36s)]
*  pretty harsh toward Trump to be [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=843.32s)]
*  honest, the respondents at least [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=845.44s)]
*  were harsher toward Trump. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=847.5600000000001s)]
*  This Harvard Harris poll is [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=849.32s)]
*  a little bit different because [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=850.7600000000001s)]
*  according to the Harvard Harris [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=852.36s)]
*  poll, more than half of Americans [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=854.12s)]
*  are actually liking what they're [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=856.0400000000001s)]
*  seeing from the Trump [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=857.9200000000001s)]
*  administration so far. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=859.12s)]
*  According to the survey of [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=860.6800000000001s)]
*  2,443 registered voters, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=862.24s)]
*  52% of the electorate approves of [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=864.12s)]
*  Trump's performance in office thus [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=866.44s)]
*  far. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=868.84s)]
*  Trump's approval rating is high [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=869.72s)]
*  among specific key constituencies [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=871.28s)]
*  that he actually struggled with in [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=873.6s)]
*  the past. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=875.8399999999999s)]
*  And that includes independence, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=876.6s)]
*  45% of which approve of how Trump [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=879.1999999999999s)]
*  is handling his job so far. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=881.8399999999999s)]
*  47% of women approve, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=884.1999999999999s)]
*  50% of Hispanics, 47% of Asians, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=886.76s)]
*  and 50% of suburbanites. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=890.68s)]
*  Now polling also shows that Trump's [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=894.0s)]
*  approval rating overall sits at 50%, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=896.1999999999999s)]
*  starkly different than some [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=898.6s)]
*  Democrats. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=900.5600000000001s)]
*  So Joe Biden was at 34%, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=901.36s)]
*  Kamala Harris at 39%, [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=903.6800000000001s)]
*  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez at 25%. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=906.24s)]
*  I know she's real hot within [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=910.36s)]
*  the Democratic party among [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=911.96s)]
*  Democratic voters, but in regard to [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=913.36s)]
*  her appeal for the rest of the [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=915.32s)]
*  country, she sits at 25%. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=917.0s)]
*  And Chuck Schumer, [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=918.88s)]
*  shockingly at 23%. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=920.36s)]
*  And I only say shockingly because I [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=922.2s)]
*  think it should be much, much lower. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=924.2s)]
*  Yeah, so if you're wondering why [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=927.08s)]
*  Donald Trump is still popular in [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=929.72s)]
*  that poll, and remember with polls, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=931.48s)]
*  they're directionally correct. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=933.76s)]
*  They're not always absolutely [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=935.6800000000001s)]
*  correct on the specifics. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=938.36s)]
*  So other polls will have Trump at [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=941.12s)]
*  a little lower number. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=942.5200000000001s)]
*  I haven't seen any at a higher [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=944.4000000000001s)]
*  number, but it's in that range, [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=945.5200000000001s)]
*  right? [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=947.0s)]
*  And the same thing on [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=947.5600000000001s)]
*  the policy issues. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=948.2800000000001s)]
*  So if you look at it just as [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=949.6s)]
*  a range, you might be wondering why [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=950.64s)]
*  is it still so high for Trump, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=951.8000000000001s)]
*  especially given all the numbers we [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=953.4000000000001s)]
*  gave you on the policies and how [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=955.0400000000001s)]
*  they're starting to sour on Doge and [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=956.5200000000001s)]
*  other things, right? [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=958.52s)]
*  The reason is because the American [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=959.92s)]
*  people are gracious and [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=961.88s)]
*  they give presidents some decent [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=963.16s)]
*  leeway in the beginning of their [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=965.0s)]
*  terms, especially because they just [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=966.76s)]
*  voted for them, right? [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=968.8s)]
*  And Trump won the popular vote. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=970.28s)]
*  And he has the leeway of 52%, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=972.16s)]
*  as I've told you many times, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=974.1999999999999s)]
*  because it's one of the most [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=976.0s)]
*  interesting polls I've ever seen in [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=977.64s)]
*  my life. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=979.8s)]
*  Barack Obama at about the same time [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=980.36s)]
*  in his first term had an approval [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=982.64s)]
*  rating of 83%. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=984.8s)]
*  So the entire, almost the entire [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=986.2s)]
*  country was behind him, right? [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=988.12s)]
*  And then obviously that number went [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=990.6s)]
*  down as they normally do. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=992.6s)]
*  And then Obama still left fairly [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=994.24s)]
*  popular, Trump doesn't have as [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=996.04s)]
*  much room to go down. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=997.88s)]
*  But the more he does these unpopular [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=1000.0s)]
*  things, the more he'll go down. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=1001.68s)]
*  The more he doesn't address the [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=1003.12s)]
*  number one thing he was elected for [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=1004.64s)]
*  inflation and the economy, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=1006.32s)]
*  the more the numbers will go down. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=1007.84s)]
*  I think Trump is an interesting cat. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=1009.8s)]
*  I think that when Bush went down, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=1011.96s)]
*  I said there was no way he was [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=1013.56s)]
*  going to recover. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=1015.0s)]
*  He doesn't have the capacity to [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=1015.8s)]
*  recover. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=1017.1999999999999s)]
*  When Biden went down in the last [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=1017.68s)]
*  two years, I said he has no [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=1019.28s)]
*  capacity to recover and [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=1020.68s)]
*  that was also true. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=1021.9599999999999s)]
*  With Trump, since he cares so [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjZTylZD2M4&t=1023.4399999999999s)]
