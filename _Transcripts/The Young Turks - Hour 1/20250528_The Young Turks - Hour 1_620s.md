TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.
The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.
On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.
Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.
Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.
TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [May 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q)
*  conspiracy theories out there. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=0.0s)]
*  There are. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=2.44s)]
*  The Epstein thing, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=2.96s)]
*  you dealt with Maria, you said, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=3.96s)]
*  as far as you know, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=5.8s)]
*  he killed himself. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=6.76s)]
*  I'm telling you he killed himself. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=7.84s)]
*  Now more than ever before, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=12.36s)]
*  I do not believe that he killed [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=13.72s)]
*  himself. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=15.32s)]
*  Now in an interview with [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=15.88s)]
*  Brett Baer that was just released, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  FBI Director Cash Patel doubled [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=19.36s)]
*  down on his assertion that Jeffrey [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=21.52s)]
*  Epstein committed suicide, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=23.92s)]
*  that there's no evidence that he [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=25.84s)]
*  committed suicide, that there's [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=28.439999999999998s)]
*  nothing shady going on here. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=30.32s)]
*  Now, when he initially made that [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=32.28s)]
*  statement with Dan Bongino right [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=34.36s)]
*  next to him and agreeing with him, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=36.54s)]
*  there was some backlash from [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=38.6s)]
*  Republican voters who think no, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=40.28s)]
*  something fishy is going on here. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=42.28s)]
*  Well, Patel also told [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=44.64s)]
*  the American people that they [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=45.76s)]
*  shouldn't expect the Epstein files [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=47.32s)]
*  to be released anytime soon, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=49.239999999999995s)]
*  despite the fact that Attorney [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  General Pam Pondy stated that she [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=52.56s)]
*  had them on her desk ready to go [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=54.68s)]
*  months ago, here's the clip. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=56.44s)]
*  The other thing on the Internet is [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=58.36s)]
*  the Epstein files. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=60.56s)]
*  What's the answer to that? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=61.92s)]
*  The answer to that is the same as [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=63.92s)]
*  everything else. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=66.12s)]
*  I'm not going to withhold [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=67.44s)]
*  information from the American [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=69.48s)]
*  public ever, but I'm also not [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=71.68s)]
*  going to rush to get it out there [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=73.56s)]
*  in a format in which they can't [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=75.56s)]
*  rely on it. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=77.52s)]
*  So on the Epstein matter or [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=78.12s)]
*  any other matters, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=79.48s)]
*  we are diligently working on that. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=80.44s)]
*  And it takes time to go through [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=82.28s)]
*  years of investigations, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=84.56s)]
*  years of political maneuvering and [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=86.6s)]
*  years of cover up to get the [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=89.24s)]
*  American people what they deserve. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=91.08s)]
*  And that's what I'm going to give [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=93.96s)]
*  them on everything. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=94.96s)]
*  Now Cenk, before I go to you, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=98.19999999999999s)]
*  I just want to remind the audience [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=99.36s)]
*  that this follows the hostage [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=100.91999999999999s)]
*  video featuring Dan Bongino and [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=102.32s)]
*  Cash Patel from earlier. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=104.12s)]
*  And if you happen to miss that, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=105.6s)]
*  here's what I'm talking about. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=107.28s)]
*  You said Jeffrey Epstein [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=110.32s)]
*  committed suicide. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=112.32s)]
*  People don't believe it. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=114.52s)]
*  Well, I mean, listen, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=115.6s)]
*  they have a right to their opinion. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=117.04s)]
*  But as someone who has worked as [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=119.6s)]
*  a public defender, as a prosecutor [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=121.12s)]
*  who's been in that prison system, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=122.76s)]
*  who's been in the Metropolitan [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=124.4s)]
*  Detention Center, who's been in [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=125.76s)]
*  segregated housing, you know a [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=127.36s)]
*  suicide when you see one and [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=129.0s)]
*  that's what that was. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=130.44s)]
*  He killed himself. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=132.6s)]
*  Again, you want me to, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=134.2s)]
*  I've seen the whole file. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=135.52s)]
*  He killed himself. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=137.48s)]
*  I don't believe them. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=141.08s)]
*  What do you think Cenk? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=142.44s)]
*  Yeah, they're definitely lying. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=144.36s)]
*  So why do I say that? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=147.04s)]
*  Look guys, we've been over this. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=149.92s)]
*  Just because the government says [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=152.72s)]
*  something doesn't mean that [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=154.04s)]
*  the opposite is a conspiracy [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=155.2s)]
*  theory. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=156.4s)]
*  What the government is putting out [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=157.48s)]
*  could be the conspiracy theory. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=159.04s)]
*  Such as Lee Harvey Oswald shooting [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=161.0s)]
*  JFK and three other people with one [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=163.04s)]
*  shot from freaking Alaska. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=165.0s)]
*  That's a conspiracy theory, okay? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=166.92000000000002s)]
*  Jack Ruby, a mobster who hated [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=170.84s)]
*  JFK, killing Lee Harvey Oswald out [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=173.56s)]
*  of patriotism in one day. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=176.48s)]
*  That's a conspiracy theory, okay? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=179.6s)]
*  So in this case, look, we couldn't [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=182.12s)]
*  have done it any better on [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=184.6s)]
*  the Young Turks. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=186.48s)]
*  We said on the day of, if the video [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=188.35999999999999s)]
*  camera in the hallway isn't [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=190.51999999999998s)]
*  working, they killed him. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=192.32s)]
*  If it is working, it was a suicide. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=194.04s)]
*  We said it ahead of time, okay? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=197.07999999999998s)]
*  It wasn't working. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=199.56s)]
*  If the camera, if the guards were [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=201.24s)]
*  looking mysteriously out and [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=203.4s)]
*  heard his roommate had just been [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=205.20000000000002s)]
*  moved and his neck is broken in [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=207.20000000000002s)]
*  three places and the video camera [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=209.16s)]
*  isn't working, the conspiracy [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=211.32000000000002s)]
*  theory is that he committed suicide. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=213.4s)]
*  The actual theory is that he was [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=216.36s)]
*  killed. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=218.12s)]
*  And so if you're going to say that [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=219.12s)]
*  landish thing, that a series of [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=221.60000000000002s)]
*  remarkable coincidence happened [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=224.24s)]
*  with the guy that was the most, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=227.20000000000002s)]
*  that needed to be the most [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=229.76000000000002s)]
*  protected inside a US prison, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=231.95999999999998s)]

*  caught up in this alleged blackmail [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=501.92s)]
*  scheme and now they're just totally [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=504.28000000000003s)]
*  changing the script. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=506.64s)]
*  Yeah, and I want to remind people [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=508.2s)]
*  of two quick things here. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=509.88s)]
*  One is when Epstein was first [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=511.08000000000004s)]
*  busted in Florida, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=512.96s)]
*  a federal prosecutor gave him [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=514.44s)]
*  the cushiest sentence of all time [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=516.5600000000001s)]
*  where he could go and [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=519.08s)]
*  work during the day. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=520.8s)]
*  So that means he was just at home. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=521.7199999999999s)]
*  He could do whatever he wanted, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=523.3199999999999s)]
*  he was totally free, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=524.1199999999999s)]
*  he could go anywhere. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=524.7199999999999s)]
*  And at night he would come into [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=525.68s)]
*  the hotel which is this nice so [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=527.4s)]
*  called jail that they had in Palm [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=529.14s)]
*  Beach, right? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=531.1999999999999s)]
*  And so is and he and that's for [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=532.7199999999999s)]
*  rape of underage girls, okay? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=535.3599999999999s)]
*  So it was an insane lack of [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=538.4s)]
*  sentencing. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=540.28s)]
*  You know what happened to that guy? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=542.16s)]
*  Randall prosecutor in Miami, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=544.0s)]
*  he became the secretary of labor [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=545.76s)]
*  under Trump in the first term. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=547.56s)]
*  Secretary of labor, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=549.6s)]
*  he didn't even have anything to [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=550.52s)]
*  do with labor. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=551.48s)]
*  But all of a sudden you get [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=552.24s)]
*  a cabinet position if you let [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=553.4s)]
*  Epstein slide. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=554.96s)]
*  And then everybody goes into [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=556.24s)]
*  the administration whether [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=557.48s)]
*  Democrat or Republican, and [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=558.64s)]
*  they go from skeptic to no, no, no, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=559.96s)]
*  no, I swear it wasn't Israel. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=561.76s)]
*  I swear, no, no, no, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=563.44s)]
*  it was definitely a suicide. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=564.52s)]
*  Wink, wink, wink. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=565.96s)]
*  Yeah, all right, I got it. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=566.92s)]
*  And so no way, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=568.24s)]
*  I don't believe any of them. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=569.28s)]
*  They're huge liars. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=571.76s)]
*  If I went in the government and [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=573.08s)]
*  I came out and said that Epstein [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=574.4s)]
*  committed suicide, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=575.6s)]
*  you know what I would do? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=576.44s)]
*  I would list all of the evidence [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=577.44s)]
*  for you. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=578.96s)]
*  I would say, look, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=579.44s)]
*  I didn't believe it. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=580.24s)]
*  And then I looked at the evidence [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=581.24s)]
*  and here's the evidence and [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=582.6s)]
*  I'm making it public. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=583.72s)]
*  Here's the reason one, two, three, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=584.96s)]
*  four, five, six, seven, eight, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=586.6s)]
*  why I think he committed suicide. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=587.96s)]
*  What I wouldn't do is, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=589.44s)]
*  just trust me, bro, okay? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=590.72s)]
*  Yeah, the powerful people that are [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=594.24s)]
*  still hiding the Epstein files. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=595.9200000000001s)]
*  That's okay, I checked in with them [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=597.9200000000001s)]
*  and they say it's cool, bro. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=599.64s)]
*  No, it's not cool, bro, okay? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=601.8000000000001s)]
*  It's not cool at all. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=604.2800000000001s)]
*  And now you're part of the scumbags [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=605.6s)]
*  who are hiding the Epstein files, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=607.8s)]
*  very likely on behalf of [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=609.88s)]
*  a foreign government. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-4-AQ5N8Q&t=611.28s)]
