Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

# Congressional Candidate Runs POPULIST Campaign After Medical Bankruptcy
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [May 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU)
*  I mean, I've been bankrupted by medical bills. I know what that feels like. Nobody else should [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=0.0s)]
*  ever have to go through that. Then it's like a stigma that runs, that you carry throughout [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=4.8s)]
*  your entire life. Well, I'm sorry, I'm not the person that's at fault here. It's the system, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=9.36s)]
*  it's screwed up, it needs to be fixed, and we're not gonna do that until we stand up. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=14.08s)]
*  And right now people are petrified or either so hacked off that they just wanna break something, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  and I can't blame them. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=26.08s)]
*  Joining me now, a new rebellion pack candidate from Wisconsin, Iron Stash, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=27.279999999999998s)]
*  Randy Bryce running again in Wisconsin. How you doing, brother? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  Great, brother, how are you? It's so good to see you. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=37.04s)]
*  Good to see you. Randy was a just Democrat, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=39.92s)]
*  ran against Paul Ryan for a while in Wisconsin, and had this amazing video that captured the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=44.08s)]
*  imagination of the country. Randy, what brings you back into politics? Why fight again on all [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=51.04s)]
*  these issues? I'm literally seeing things crumble in front of me. Our safety net is under attack, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=59.92s)]
*  and it's worse. I mean, I didn't think it could get worse than when Trump was first elected. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=69.92s)]
*  But now he's redistributing the wealth of the working people like me up to the wealthiest. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=75.67999999999999s)]
*  I'm sick of all this money in politics. Just this morning, we went to a Social Security office [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=82.8s)]
*  that we had a protest at in support of, only to be told that they had relocated to another part [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=89.11999999999999s)]
*  of the city. And we stopped for coffee with some seniors to help start our lunch up this morning. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=96.96s)]
*  So then we drive all the way out to this other place, and it's inaccessible. The bus route is [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=103.12s)]
*  literally, you have to cross a freeway to get to this place, and it's like a mile away from the [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=109.2s)]
*  bus stop. Today it was raining, it was pretty crappy weather. I can only imagine when it snows [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=115.84s)]
*  here and somebody has to travel that to get with a walker. It's crazy. Just looking at this big, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=120.64000000000001s)]
*  beautiful bill as well, and they wanna take more. When does it end? When does it end? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=129.84s)]
*  You can't be homeless, that's illegal too. Working people really need a break, and we sure are headed [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=136.32s)]
*  in the wrong direction. It's just, I mean, what Donald Trump said sounded good, I understand. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=143.44s)]
*  People liking what he said, but to realize he's not in it for us, he's in it for himself. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=148.72s)]
*  And Brian Stile has just, he hasn't done anything. He's avoiding town halls, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=156.56s)]
*  he's running from people, and we need somebody that's gonna run for people. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=161.04s)]
*  Yeah, I wanna get back to what you did for a living. I wanna get back to your opponent [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=164.24s)]
*  in a second, but you opened up a really interesting topic here. So Trump ran as a populist, but [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=169.6s)]
*  I've been calling him a fake populist this whole time. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=176.64000000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=179.2s)]
*  But he had at least enough sense to run as a populist. So when you first ran for Congress, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=179.44s)]
*  you're a progressive populist, you're on the left, you believe in economic populism. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=186.24s)]
*  And so the establishment didn't love that, right, of the Democratic Party. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=191.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=195.44s)]
*  And so they had the wrong strategy, and that strategy was proven wrong in Hillary Clinton's [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=196.0s)]
*  laws, Kamala Harris' laws, etc. But Trump comes in pretending to be a populist, but what kind of [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=201.84s)]
*  populist closes down social security offices, right? So they came in, they cut hundreds of [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=209.04s)]
*  thousands of jobs of people who hadn't done anything wrong in the government. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=214.88s)]
*  They closed down a whole bunch of social security offices, now they're looking to cut Medicaid. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=218.32s)]
*  And all of this in order to get a $5 trillion tax cut for the rich [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=222.32s)]
*  in the so-called Big Beautiful bill. Randy, isn't that the exact opposite of populism? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=226.64s)]
*  It sure is, it sure is. And it's time to reclaim that title, because we're the ones that actually [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=231.68s)]
*  I mean, how could somebody like Donald Trump know what a working person goes through on a daily basis? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=240.56s)]
*  Here's a guy saying girls should have two dollars while he has his condo in New York City, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=248.0s)]
*  his gold-plated everything, he's got a gold toilet for crying out loud. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=254.79999999999998s)]
*  I mean, I know personally guys that have worked on a project for him that have gotten stiffed out of [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=259.03999999999996s)]
*  being paid just because the way he operates where they have a list that needs to get done [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=265.68s)]
*  before they get an exit like say 50% of the project has to get completed and then they get [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=272.64s)]
*  certain amount of money. Well, they keep adding projects that need to get done to be added on to [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=277.2s)]
*  make it to that 50%. So small contractors are getting screwed, they're going out of business [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=282.88s)]
*  because of him. He's anti-union, he's just trampled all over the federal workers unions. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=288.24s)]
*  And I drive by a place that's in the neighborhood that has a pro-union sign and [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=296.8s)]
*  a Donald Trump sign. And I just want to stop my car, get out and talk to this person. It's like [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=304.40000000000003s)]
*  how can you have two fighting signs in your front yard? Again, what he said sounded good, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=310.96000000000004s)]
*  his promises sounded good, but he has no intent of following through. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=316.88s)]
*  And that's why we need people, representation in Congress that understands what it's like to [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=323.68s)]
*  live paycheck to paycheck. I mean, I've been bankrupted by medical bills. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=329.84s)]
*  I know what that feels like. Nobody else should ever have to go through that, ever. And then it's [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=336.0s)]
*  like a stigma that runs, that you carry throughout your entire life. Well, I'm sorry, I'm not the [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=341.6s)]
*  person that's at fault here. It's the system, it's screwed up, it needs to be fixed and we're not [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=347.92s)]
*  going to do that until we stand up. And right now people are petrified or either so hacked off that [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=353.20000000000005s)]
*  they just want to break something and I can't blame them. Yeah, I prefer building things. So I [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=360.48s)]
*  love that you're building that campaign. Yes, I'm building not demolition, construction not [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=367.04s)]
*  demolition. That's right. And so that actually relates back to, and I want to get back to that [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=373.28000000000003s)]
*  bankruptcy in a second, but back to your life story. So before you got into politics, what was [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=378.0s)]
*  your job, Randy? Union ironworker. Yeah, how long did you do that? Close to 25 years. 25 years as an [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=384.08000000000004s)]
*  ironworker. Okay, so when, tell me about the situation with the medical bankruptcy, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=393.36s)]
*  because this affects so many Americans. I think more than half of bankruptcies in America are not [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=399.84000000000003s)]
*  the Donald Trump type, where they decide to start three casinos in the same city, right? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=404.96000000000004s)]
*  They're driven into bankruptcy by medical bills. How can you go bankrupt with a casino? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=409.68s)]
*  It's amazing. It's the closest thing to like a money machine, money printing machine. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=417.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, no, he found a way to screw it up. Like now it says the household always wins [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=422.0s)]
*  asterisks unless Donald Trump runs the house. Which by the way, is kind of what he's gonna do [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=427.44s)]
*  now to us. He's gonna bankrupt the country. But tell me about what happened to you with the [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=431.28s)]
*  medical bills. Well, this was before I was an ironworker. And I mean, I felt the pain and it was, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=435.28s)]
*  being a younger guy, I was in my late 20s. I'm thinking I can get through this. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=446.72s)]
*  Basically, I have to get through this because I don't have insurance. I was working two jobs, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=452.15999999999997s)]
*  bartending in the evening and I worked security during the day, two full time jobs. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=457.92s)]
*  Neither one of them provided health insurance. So this was after I was gonna go have, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=465.52s)]
*  get a check out. My mom made me go because I couldn't, it got to the point where I'd walk and [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=471.76s)]
*  like it. I'd wince and I didn't realize that I was wincing. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=476.8s)]
*  And my mom was like, I've had enough, you're going to the doctor with me. So she took me [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=481.44000000000005s)]
*  to the doctor and he did examine me and threw a pamphlet on the table in front of me about [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=486.72s)]
*  testicular cancer. And that, I mean, that's how I found out that I had cancer. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=494.88000000000005s)]
*  And then so then he was like, well, the next thing is to talk about insurance. I was like, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=500.8s)]
*  I don't have any. He was like, let me make a phone call. He called freighter and I ended [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=506.08s)]
*  up looking into getting like those basically a guinea pig for the medical college there. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=511.44s)]
*  But I got the treatment done I needed and they did a fantastic job. But after that, I needed [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=516.3199999999999s)]
*  some other tests. And without having insurance, what do you do? It's like you go in there. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=523.6s)]
*  They don't even tell you how much it's going to cost ahead of time, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=532.88s)]
*  whatever medical procedure you need to have done. It's like, oh, we don't tell you that. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=536.4s)]
*  And then just start getting bills. And it's like the amount that they charge for what they do was [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=542.72s)]
*  just, it's like, holy crap, to the point where you're like, just you just feel hopeless. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=547.52s)]
*  And just it's a very bad place to be. It's very depressing. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=554.0s)]
*  And it's not something I would wish on anybody. And that's why I look around the world. We're the [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=558.88s)]
*  only industrialized country that doesn't have some kind of nationalized healthcare. And [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=564.24s)]
*  it just, I mean, it's something else. Now I'm working with disabled people. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=570.88s)]
*  And it's hard enough for other working people that are able to get a job and have decent pay. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=576.0s)]
*  But now I'm seeing what disabled people have to go through as well. And the insurance, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=584.48s)]
*  Wisconsin doesn't want to expand badger care, which is what so many disabled people rely on [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=591.28s)]
*  for their healthcare. That with the other cuts that are coming, it's all, there's no sunshine. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=597.12s)]
*  There's no sunshine to look forward to. But that's what needs to change. And that's why [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=604.0s)]
*  with Rebellion PAC, and I'm just glad to be a part of that, Cenk. I'm glad you started that up [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=609.6s)]
*  because everything in there, especially, I mean, getting the money out is like the number one thing. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=614.08s)]
*  And it sucks that you have to play by the rules that are in place before you can change the rules. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=619.9200000000001s)]
*  Because they're designed to keep people like me out. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=625.84s)]
*  Yeah, by the way, Randy's site is Bryceforcongress.com. So make sure you're [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=628.4000000000001s)]
*  checking that out, Bryceforcongress.com. So Randy, just one more thing on the [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=633.6s)]
*  medical bills there. It puts you at the mercy of the companies you work for, right? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=638.0s)]
*  So you had two jobs, but they didn't provide healthcare. So then you're out of luck, right? [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=642.96s)]
*  And if you were at a job that you hated, but they provided healthcare and then you got cancer, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=647.36s)]
*  you're out of luck. You gotta stay with that employer, right? [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=651.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=654.0s)]
*  So that's, and you mentioned every other [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=654.48s)]
*  development nation has universal healthcare. We're the only ones who don't, right? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=657.6800000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=660.72s)]
*  And then the populist plank that you signed, it's got, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=661.2s)]
*  we've gotta negotiate drug prices through Medicare, right? [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=667.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=670.5600000000001s)]
*  So Randy, when you look at that, and we're all have become kind of indentured servants [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=671.76s)]
*  to these corporations, right? And without that- [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=676.72s)]
*  That's a good term, yes. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=679.36s)]
*  Yeah, without them we might literally die, right? That's how they've got us on the hook. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=680.48s)]
*  And then they say, by the way, you're not even allowed to negotiate the drug prices. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=686.16s)]
*  You just have to pay the ransom. You don't have a choice. I mean, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=689.4399999999999s)]
*  what kind of sick government has this developed into? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=692.8s)]
*  I, and it's the same pill that they sell someplace else, the same bottle for [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=696.48s)]
*  pennies on the dollar, what we charge ourselves for. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=704.0s)]
*  It's because pharmaceutical companies, who I'm not gonna take a penny from, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=708.64s)]
*  again in this election, are making big money off of us. And it's like we're all money farms. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=713.84s)]
*  And they come by and they shave us for whatever money they can. They let it grow back for a little [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=719.52s)]
*  while and then it's like, okay, it's time to shave them again. Let's figure out something else. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=725.12s)]
*  Yeah, and it's not designed for working people. The government is not designed for working people. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=730.0s)]
*  They're not looking out for us. There are some fantastic proponents who we all are aware of [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=736.88s)]
*  that are traveling around now, hitting districts where the representatives are afraid and their [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=744.48s)]
*  leadership, the NRCC, is telling them, don't go talk to your constituents, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=750.24s)]
*  because we screwed up in Washington, DC. And it's a horrible place, but it's a country that I [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=756.0s)]
*  signed up for three years of my life in the army. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=768.48s)]
*  And it's one that when you put in that much investment into a country [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=771.36s)]
*  where you're willing to give your life, it means that you wanna protect it. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=775.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=781.84s)]
*  And I took that oath and I still live by it, all of these foreign and domestic, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=782.6400000000001s)]
*  and just making this place a better place than it was when I got here. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=790.1600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so I want everybody to know, by the way, anybody who's in a rebellion pack [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=794.24s)]
*  can't take corporate PAC money, does not take corporate PAC money. So [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=798.96s)]
*  Randy doesn't take it, Ojeda doesn't take it, Ro Khanna doesn't take it. Hopefully, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=802.0s)]
*  we'll have even more candidates coming soon. And in fact, by the way, if you wanna be a candidate, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=805.92s)]
*  you could apply through RebellionPAC.com. Randy already ran a great race, is in a tough district. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=809.92s)]
*  And now here you are again, Randy, in another tough district. So this is a red district, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=818.88s)]
*  right? So this is bold of you. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=824.3199999999999s)]
*  It's better than it was when I ran before. They added the University of [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=825.68s)]
*  Whitewater. So we have a college campus and we really plan on getting out the youth vote. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=831.6s)]
*  Yeah, so right now, because it is a red district, for the moment being, right, until you win. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=837.0400000000001s)]
*  Who's your opponent and what's his backstory? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=847.52s)]
*  His name is Brian Stile and he was a corporate attorney. He helped out search jobs [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=852.96s)]
*  from Wisconsin. I can't remember the name of the place where he worked at, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=859.4399999999999s)]
*  but he was Paul Ryan's driver for a while too. It looks very similar and I wouldn't doubt that [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=864.72s)]
*  he inherited Paul Ryan's wardrobe and the same ideas. I mean, Paul Ryan was famous for [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=872.16s)]
*  gutting Social Security. And this guy made a commercial last time he ran, promising his [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=880.3199999999999s)]
*  100 year old sweet grandmother. I mean, it's just breaking my heart watching him lie to her [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=886.64s)]
*  about he's never gonna do anything to hurt our social safety net. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=893.28s)]
*  And here she is saying, I know you won't, Brian. And I'm like, my God, bringing your grandmother [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=898.0s)]
*  on is okay, but lying to her in front of all these people is just so horrible. But he's one of the [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=904.96s)]
*  people, he's running away from people. And that's why you get somebody that's running from people [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=912.64s)]
*  and I'm running for people who really cares. And it's been around, there are more protesters. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=918.16s)]
*  One I just found out about on the first and third Wednesday, and there's like, I mean, 60 people. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=925.6s)]
*  It's like the second most busiest intersection in the state of Wisconsin, one of the guys is [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=933.12s)]
*  telling me today. They have like 60 to 100 people show up those two days every day that they have [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=937.76s)]
*  this event. And I know there's other events going on, people are just really fed up and they're [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=946.48s)]
*  making their own groups and I think it's fantastic. But we're not getting any help from the government. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=951.92s)]
*  Yeah, so Randy, I mean, look, if the American government was run by [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=959.9200000000001s)]
*  real Americans like you, it would be amazing, right? Because- [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=963.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=966.96s)]
*  Like if you were all, like you don't take the corporate PAC money, so you [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=968.8000000000001s)]
*  would work for your voters instead of your donors already a million times better, right? [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=973.2800000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=977.6800000000001s)]
*  But for Brian Stile, one more thing. So he's gonna sign on to that bill, right? The tax cut bill. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=979.0400000000001s)]
*  No doubt. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=986.0s)]
*  So when he does, isn't that a bit of an albatross around his neck? [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=987.36s)]
*  Because they- [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=991.52s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=992.08s)]
*  Because they claim that they wanna balance the budget, but they never ever balance the budget. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=992.96s)]
*  That's gonna put a $5 trillion hole in the budget. So are you gonna use that to run against them? [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=996.5600000000001s)]
*  Absolutely. Absolutely, I am. Everything, he's already got a record. That's another thing [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1002.72s)]
*  that wasn't in place the first time I ran against him. He had no negatives. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1008.5600000000001s)]
*  At this time, he has a horrible voting record and it's only gonna get worse, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1012.8s)]
*  especially him being saddled up with Trump. And again, there's a reason why he's afraid of [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1017.92s)]
*  talking to voters in the first district. There's a reason why people are having to have their own [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1026.56s)]
*  empty chair, cut out Brian Stile town hall meetings. He doesn't care about us. He doesn't [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1032.56s)]
*  have to care about us cuz he doesn't depend on us for his money. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1038.32s)]
*  Yeah, I think that maybe you'll put him out of style. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1042.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1045.9199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I'm here for the dad jokes all day long. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1050.0s)]
*  You're a shade. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1051.9199999999998s)]
*  Maybe we'll make signs like that. All right, Randy, one more thing. So look, sometimes folks [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1054.3999999999999s)]
*  promised and talked a good game, then get into Congress and all of a sudden they just start [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1060.72s)]
*  listening to Democratic establishment, right? So if the Democratic establishment says, hey, [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1066.88s)]
*  Randy, nice job on winning Congress back and we appreciate it. But we're not gonna negotiate [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1071.7600000000002s)]
*  drug prices and we're not gonna do paid family leave, etc. What's your response to that? [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1076.4s)]
*  No, I'm totally opposed to that. That's something that I wrote down. I took an oath to help promote [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1081.2800000000002s)]
*  those issues. And that's something that I definitely am gonna fight for. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1091.04s)]
*  Because again, I know I'm gonna come back to the district and talk to people. And if they don't [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1097.84s)]
*  like, I mean, that's a promise that I will have a town hall in every county. And there's quite a [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1103.68s)]
*  few counties in the district that people can have an opportunity to that. I can tell them what's [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1111.04s)]
*  going on in Washington, DC, so we can help work together to come up with things. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1116.64s)]
*  And just make sure that we do fight for those things. And when I come back, [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1123.92s)]
*  I would prefer not to get yelled at, but that's why I need to communicate with the district. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1132.64s)]
*  Something Brian Stile isn't doing and they deserve the people that vote. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1138.16s)]
*  Actually, even if you don't vote, you deserve representation in the district. And we're gonna [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1142.24s)]
*  try to get people out to vote. And it's like, look, all those good things you heard that were lies, [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1146.24s)]
*  they could be made real. But again, like the video says, it's gonna take everybody working together. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1154.96s)]
*  And it really will. And I'm not afraid to go talk to places that generally Democrats haven't been [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1161.36s)]
*  welcome to talk to. Yeah. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1166.64s)]
*  That's what we need to do. We need to open up conversations. And there are things we can agree [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1170.16s)]
*  upon. And that's all we need to do is have that first step. I mean, I saw you had MTG on [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1174.24s)]
*  the other week talking and we agreed upon, everybody agreed upon no wars. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1180.4s)]
*  And it's something for helping veterans. When I get elected, it's like going to [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1185.52s)]
*  Republican colleagues and saying, let's do something to help veterans, [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1191.76s)]
*  just so we can see that we can work together. Yeah. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1195.36s)]
*  It's too ugly now. It's too ugly and there's no need for it. And we need to admit when we make [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1199.1200000000001s)]
*  mistakes, people make mistakes, political people make mistakes. It's okay. We don't have to be [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1206.48s)]
*  perfect. I mean, I'm not perfect, but I own up to things that I've done. And I take responsibility [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1212.72s)]
*  for things that I have done. And that's what we need, working people in Congress that know [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1219.84s)]
*  what it's like to live paycheck to paycheck. Yeah. And look, when you're in that situation, [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1226.72s)]
*  you don't have the luxury of saying, I'm going to be morally pure and I'm not gonna work with [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1232.08s)]
*  this person or that person. So I'm sure that you disagree with Marjorie Taylor Greene on the tax [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1236.72s)]
*  bill, on just about every other bill. But Ro Khanna and Matt Gaetz did an anti-corruption bill. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1243.1200000000001s)]
*  I think AOC joined, right? And if they're actually doing anti-corruption, the few of them that are, [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1248.8s)]
*  or they're actually anti-war, as Marjorie Taylor Greene was saying. She says she'll oppose Trump [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1254.08s)]
*  if he attacks Iran, right? So if you've got someone who's an ally on that particular issue, [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1260.8s)]
*  wouldn't it be amazing if the establishment was ignored? [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1267.1999999999998s)]
*  And there was an uprising of the right-wing voters and the left-wing voters. And we joined and said, [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1271.1999999999998s)]
*  no, guys, we said anti-war, we meant anti-war. Wouldn't that be just, look, it doesn't mean that [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1278.0s)]
*  you're naive and you're gonna say, and in return, I'll vote for your $5 trillion in taxes for the [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1286.0s)]
*  rich. No way, right? But if they're coming to our position, isn't that a good thing in America? [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1290.72s)]
*  It's a great thing. It's a great thing, especially because it's so hard to find common ground with [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1298.0s)]
*  people on the other side of the aisle these days. And it's almost automatic. They come up with an [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1304.64s)]
*  idea, we shoot it down. We come up with an idea, they shoot it down. And it's like before even [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1309.1200000000001s)]
*  finishing reading the sentence. That's no way to work together. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1314.64s)]
*  And you know what? It's all because too many politicians have been auctioned off and are owned [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1320.88s)]
*  by billionaires and corporations. And it's like they don't have to think, just, [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1328.08s)]
*  you know, we want you to vote this way. And shortly thereafter, magically, money appears [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1334.48s)]
*  in their packs. I don't plan on operating that way. I mean, we raised over $8 million [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1340.6399999999999s)]
*  last time and most of it was by small dollar amounts. We're kind of doing it again this time. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1348.32s)]
*  And that's the only way we're gonna take back this country is by turning down easy big money. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1354.8s)]
*  Yeah. And so- [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1362.32s)]
*  But that involves selling our souls, you know? And that's something I know, I value mine too much. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1363.84s)]
*  I couldn't face people that I love and care about if I would sell out. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1372.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1378.24s)]
*  I don't have a problem working together with people. But there are some [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1379.04s)]
*  things that are just, no, you don't touch that. Social security, Medicare, those are two things [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1384.72s)]
*  I'm willing to put up one heck of a fight for. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1392.0s)]
*  Yeah, and damn straight. So I'm gonna end on a fun question here, but first, everybody remember, [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1394.88s)]
*  it's BryceforCongress.com. We'll have the link down below to BryceforCongress.com. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1400.24s)]
*  Iron stash on social medias. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1405.44s)]
*  Yeah, and check them out on social media as well. Iron stash is back, tell everybody. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1407.68s)]
*  So look, and you're in a red district, so you gotta win over the independent voters to win there. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1412.5600000000002s)]
*  And the good news is the core democratic policies, the economically populous policies you sign on for, [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1417.92s)]
*  negotiating drug prices, higher wages, anti-war, anti-corruption, lower housing prices, etc. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1425.1200000000001s)]
*  That plays well everywhere. Independents love it. And the people who got hoodwinked by Trump [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1433.28s)]
*  thinking he was gonna do it, well, you give them an alternative in a red district. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1439.76s)]
*  And by the time they realize they got hoodwinked, there's Randy Bryce ready to build something. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1443.68s)]
*  And if you're gonna build something, an iron worker is a good way to go, right? [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1448.8s)]
*  Absolutely. If you want something built right, that's gonna stand, testify him, yes. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1452.72s)]
*  Yeah. So Randy, the fun question to end. Once I was talking about Ojeda and I called him lead pipe, [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1459.04s)]
*  and then that idea then popped into my head. And I thought, you and him are such an amazing [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1466.48s)]
*  populist team, right? He's 24 year veteran, you're a veteran, an iron worker, etc. He's [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1472.64s)]
*  running in North Carolina, you're running in Wisconsin. You're both a rebellion pack. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1477.84s)]
*  But I don't wanna be presumptuous. So would you rather be blowtorch or lead pipe? [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1482.32s)]
*  But try blowtorch. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1490.96s)]
*  Blowtorch? Yeah, that makes sense for an iron worker. All right, so you're blowtorch, [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1492.64s)]
*  Ojeda will be lead pipe. You guys, you start here on TYT, but I hope left wing shows, [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1496.48s)]
*  right wing shows. He's fun. I've met him several times. I really like the guy. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1503.2s)]
*  Yeah. He's gonna win. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1510.4s)]
*  You know what it is? Real Americans taking the country back. Enough, enough, enough with [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1511.6s)]
*  everybody working for corporations and working for the donors. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1516.08s)]
*  What a concept. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1518.64s)]
*  Yeah, so let's get lead pipe and blowtorches on as many shows as possible. Show people what [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1519.28s)]
*  populism really looks like. Randy, I'm gonna thank you at the end here because- [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1528.08s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1532.6399999999999s)]
*  Thank you for having the courage to run again and to get back in the fight. The only way we're [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1533.12s)]
*  gonna win is if guys like you get back in the fight. So thank you, brother. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1538.3999999999999s)]
*  Well, we need more. We need more. Thank you, Cenk, for helping pull us together. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1541.44s)]
*  It's great to be put in touch with other fantastic candidates. I love what you're doing. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1547.2s)]
*  And I mean, just reading that, I was like, the plank is just common sense. It's just common sense. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1552.8s)]
*  And it's things we can make happen. Let's make it happen. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1559.68s)]
*  All right. And we'll put a link to all these things, populistplank.com, rebellionpack.com. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1563.12s)]
*  But most importantly, go check out Bryceforcongress.com. See what Randy's all about. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1qy0MtSOU&t=1568.96s)]
