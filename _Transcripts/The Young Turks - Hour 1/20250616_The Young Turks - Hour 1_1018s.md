"President Trump said ‚Äúit‚Äôs possible‚Äù the United States becomes involved in the current conflict between Iran and Israel, ABC News reported Sunday.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not involved in it. It‚Äôs possible we could get involved. But we are not at this moment involved,‚Äù Trump told ABC News."

# Israel Inflicts MASS CASUALTIES In Iran
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk)
*  Not far from Tel Aviv in the city of Petah Tikva, at least four Israelis were killed [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=0.0s)]
*  after a missile slammed into this building, bringing the number of deaths since last week [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=8.32s)]
*  to at least 24. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=13.88s)]
*  But the toll Israel has inflicted on Iran is far higher, 224 killed, including women [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=16.12s)]
*  and children, as well as the ongoing assassination of top military commanders and nuclear scientists. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=24.68s)]
*  So there you have it, four days after Israel launched an offensive war against Iran, the [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=34.08s)]
*  violence continues. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=37.84s)]
*  And now Donald Trump is hinting at the United States getting more involved in the war that [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=38.84s)]
*  Israel started here. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=45.0s)]
*  So, Jen, before we get to more details, weigh in. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=47.16s)]
*  Yeah, so I said as Israel was starting this war that they would pretend to be the victims, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=51.16s)]
*  even though they clearly struck first. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=57.6s)]
*  Clearly it's a so-called preemptive war, but as Netanyahu admitted over the weekend, actually [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=59.92s)]
*  not preemptive. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=65.2s)]
*  It turns out they were a long way away from having any kind of nuclear weapon, as we suspected, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=67.16s)]
*  but Netanyahu even admitted it. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=71.52s)]
*  So we're gonna give those details to you guys in a little bit. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=73.36s)]
*  And so what's happening now is amazing, because we've got a war both between Israel and Iran, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=76.88s)]
*  but we got a war at home in America for who's going to be able to affect Donald Trump's [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=84.8s)]
*  decision on whether to go further. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=90.0s)]
*  Because is America involved in this war? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=91.96s)]
*  Absolutely, in ways that we're about to explain now. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=94.44s)]
*  All right, so let's go there. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=97.44s)]
*  To catch you up on what's happened over the past few days, here it is. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=100.24s)]
*  Israel attacked Iran's state television station in the middle of a broadcast, pretty explosive [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=103.8s)]
*  to watch Tehran residents attempting to flee the capital in search of safety. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=109.32s)]
*  The centrifuges housed underground at a key Iranian nuclear facility remain intact at [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=116.2s)]
*  this hour. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=124.08s)]
*  It's likely that only the US has the weapons required to damage that site, so watching [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=125.32s)]
*  that closely. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=130.78s)]
*  In the meantime, Iran struck an Israeli oil refinery overnight and damaged part of the [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=131.82s)]
*  power grid. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=136.74s)]
*  Residential buildings were hit in and around Tel Aviv, killing at least 24 so far. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=138.3s)]
*  So things are escalating. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=143.74s)]
*  Since Israel launched its attack early Friday morning, the US has provided defensive support [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=145.54s)]
*  to Israel, intercepting Iranian strikes. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=151.34s)]
*  So far, we've stopped short of joining the offensive campaigns. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=154.52s)]
*  But on Sunday, here's what President Donald Trump told ABC News. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=158.78s)]
*  We're not involved in it. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=164.62s)]
*  It's possible we could get involved, but we are not at this moment involved. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=166.86s)]
*  Sources familiar with the matter say Israel has spoken with the US about possibly increasing [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=173.74s)]
*  the level of involvement, United States level of involvement. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=179.78s)]
*  So one Israeli official cautioned those conversations have not yet included practical discussions [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=183.78s)]
*  of the finer details. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=189.74s)]
*  CNN with that reporting. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=191.3s)]
*  And while Trump hopes to avoid a prolonged conflict that could further destabilize the [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=193.64s)]
*  Middle East, some in the administration recognize that American military assistance may help [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=199.18s)]
*  rather Israel conclude its objectives more quickly according to the sources. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=205.98s)]
*  So all of that seems to signal that it's incredibly likely we will get more involved in this offensive [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=211.94s)]
*  campaign. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=219.14s)]
*  Plus, Donald Trump is doubling down on his claim that Israel attacking Iran will actually [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=220.14s)]
*  help move nuclear negotiations forward. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=225.74s)]
*  Asked if there's a deadline for Iran to come to the table, Trump told ABC this. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=228.98s)]
*  No, there's no deadline, but they are talking. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=233.82s)]
*  They'd like to make a deal. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=237.42s)]
*  They're talking. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=239.14s)]
*  They continue to talk. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=240.42s)]
*  Something like this had to happen because I think even from both sides, but something [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=243.5s)]
*  like this had to happen. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=247.94s)]
*  They want to talk. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=249.94s)]
*  They will be rather talking, may have forced a deal to go quicker actually, as the president [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=251.18s)]
*  talking to ABC. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=258.1s)]
*  Now, the only sign Trump's trying to keep Netanyahu in check is that according to two [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=259.1s)]
*  sources he opposed an Israeli plan to kill Iran's supreme leader. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=264.06s)]
*  During an ABC News interview this morning, Netanyahu suggested that is still on the table, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=270.18s)]
*  hilariously claiming that his attack on Iran is actually preventing war. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=276.5s)]
*  Listen to this. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=281.38s)]
*  US officials tell us that the president flatly rejected a plan, an opportunity that the Israelis [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=282.38s)]
*  had to take out the supreme leader. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=292.97999999999996s)]
*  Do you understand his concern? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=296.06s)]
*  My understanding is his concern is that this would escalate the conflict beyond where it [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=297.46000000000004s)]
*  is already. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=302.3s)]
*  It's not going to escalate the conflict. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=303.3s)]
*  It's going to end the conflict. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=305.3s)]
*  We've had half a century of conflict spread by this regime that terrorizes everyone in [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=306.5s)]
*  the Middle East, has bombed the Aramco oil fields in Saudi Arabia, is spreading terrorism [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=312.14000000000004s)]
*  and subversion and sabotage everywhere. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=317.18s)]
*  The forever war is what Iran wants, and they're bringing us to the brink of nuclear war. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=320.34000000000003s)]
*  In fact, what Israel is doing is preventing this, bringing an end to this aggression. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=325.1s)]
*  And we can only do so by standing up to the forces of evil. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=330.3s)]
*  So are you going to target the supreme leader? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=334.06s)]
*  Look, we're doing what we need to do. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=335.70000000000005s)]
*  I'm not going to get into the details. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=338.42s)]
*  All right, so there's Netanyahu. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=340.06s)]
*  Cenk, I want to know, I mean, it's unfair to ask, but where do you think this thing [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=343.78000000000003s)]
*  is going? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=348.18s)]
*  Our involvement, the United States getting in deeper, will the supreme leader of Iran [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=349.18s)]
*  be targeted? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=353.5s)]
*  And also why it seems the more the president talks, the less we learn. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=354.66s)]
*  It's just a lot of double speak. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=359.24s)]
*  Yeah, so I want to start with Netanyahu and break down what he just said, because it was [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=361.3s)]
*  amazing. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=366.14000000000004s)]
*  And then I want to get back into their plan all along, because it turns out they never [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=367.22s)]
*  had a chance of taking out the nuclear facilities. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=373.70000000000005s)]
*  They can't do it without us. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=375.70000000000005s)]
*  They're now admitting that. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=376.82000000000005s)]
*  So we're going to come back to that in a second. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=377.82000000000005s)]
*  So Netanyahu in this clip says, we're just trying to stop the aggressive wars, as he [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=379.34s)]
*  literally just launched an aggressive war. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=385.15999999999997s)]
*  Everything he says is projection. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=389.14s)]
*  He says Iran terrorizes everyone else in the Middle East. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=391.53999999999996s)]
*  No, that's literally what Israel does. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=396.73999999999995s)]
*  They've attacked Iran, Syria, Lebanon. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=399.02s)]
*  They've also attacked Yemen. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=401.9s)]
*  They've certainly destroyed, leveled Gaza. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=403.29999999999995s)]
*  They're driving people out of their homes and killing them in the West Bank. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=406.82s)]
*  They've attacked almost all their neighbors and they terrorize all of their neighbors. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=410.7s)]
*  So Iran didn't do any of that. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=414.40000000000003s)]
*  Israel did that, okay? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=415.98s)]
*  Then he talks about, they constantly do sabotage in the Middle East. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=417.42s)]
*  You mean like pagers blowing up? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=420.38s)]
*  I mean, sabotage, are you kidding me? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=422.86s)]
*  I mean, he's almost trying to rub it in your face like, I'm telling you all the things [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=425.14s)]
*  we do and pretend it's Iran. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=429.34000000000003s)]
*  Now watch, I'll get the American media to play along. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=431.74s)]
*  It'll be hilarious. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=433.58000000000004s)]
*  And the American media does play along, I'll get back to that too. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=434.98s)]
*  But the most important part connects these two things to two major issues I brought up. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=438.18s)]
*  Cuz Trump says don't take out Ayatollah. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=442.70000000000005s)]
*  Now they already took out the top negotiator for Iran. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=445.34000000000003s)]
*  They're like, get back to the negotiating table. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=448.62s)]
*  With who? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=451.5s)]
*  You murdered their negotiator, okay? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=452.5s)]
*  They took out one of the top politicians. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=454.58000000000004s)]
*  They took out the three top military commanders, but they left Ayatollah. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=456.06s)]
*  Now the thing that really got me, guys, was, like the war starts 24, 48 hours later. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=462.38s)]
*  Israeli officials keep popping up all over. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=471.9s)]
*  You have Galant, their former defense minister, etc. saying, well, obviously we can't destroy [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=473.82s)]
*  their nuclear facilities. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=479.21999999999997s)]
*  America has to do that for us. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=480.21999999999997s)]
*  And they have a quote unquote obligation to do it. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=482.3s)]
*  No, we don't. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=486.3s)]
*  So you start this war knowing that you can't achieve your stated objective. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=489.58s)]
*  Cuz you think, well, America is my dog, so I'll have him come fetch. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=495.46s)]
*  I'll start a war that I know I can't win based on my own defined victory, which is ending [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=501.5s)]
*  their nuclear program, destroying all their nuclear facilities. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=510.21999999999997s)]
*  I know only America can, but my plan is to drag in the sucker Americans to pay for this [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=513.3399999999999s)]
*  war, to carry out this war, to have your soldiers die, your airmen die. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=520.22s)]
*  No, no, you die for Israel. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=526.62s)]
*  That was their plan all along. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=528.9399999999999s)]
*  Cuz they're admitting it now. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=531.6999999999999s)]
*  We can't take out their nuclear facilities. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=532.9s)]
*  Then what did you start it for? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=534.22s)]
*  There is a second option. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=535.6999999999999s)]
*  That brings us back to the Ayatollah. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=537.74s)]
*  Why did Trump veto it, but Netanyahu's obviously josing to do it, and you could tell in that [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=539.68s)]
*  interview. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=544.4799999999999s)]
*  Because this is about regime change, just like Iraq. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=546.12s)]
*  Why do they want the regime change? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=549.52s)]
*  Just like in Iraq, where by the way, to be fair, we had all this evidence of weapons [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=551.9s)]
*  of mass destruction. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=556.4799999999999s)]
*  It turned out to be fake. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=557.4799999999999s)]
*  And you know where we got that evidence? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=558.7199999999999s)]
*  Israel. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=560.9599999999999s)]
*  Isn't that funny? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=561.9599999999999s)]
*  And whenever you ask, hey, how is Israel our special ally? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=564.0799999999999s)]
*  We've given them $311 million. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=567.0s)]
*  They've given us, they go, we give you great intelligence. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=568.96s)]
*  Do you? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=571.98s)]
*  Do you? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=573.08s)]
*  So now, they wanna do a regime change because before the Iraq war, Israeli Prime Minister [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=574.1800000000001s)]
*  said Iraq's our number one enemy. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=579.4s)]
*  Now they say Iran's our number one enemy. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=581.5s)]
*  Not ours as in America, not even close. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=583.52s)]
*  They mean ours as in Israel. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=586.6s)]
*  So apparently America has an obligation to constantly take out their top enemy in the [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=588.44s)]
*  Middle East, so they can continue terrorizing the Middle East. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=594.64s)]
*  So we have that obligation. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=598.24s)]
*  We spent several trillion dollars doing that in Iraq on behalf of Israel. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=599.24s)]
*  What did America get out of it? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=603.8s)]
*  Now everybody agrees, the right wing agrees, the left wing agrees, zero. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=605.02s)]
*  We got nothing out of it. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=608.54s)]
*  We got a bunch of dead soldiers coming home in coffins. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=609.54s)]
*  But don't worry, the IDF didn't have to fight that war. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=612.52s)]
*  So now they tell us, now we're gonna do a regime change in Iran. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=614.92s)]
*  Why? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=617.64s)]
*  Because then if we do that, we're gonna be greeted as liberators. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=618.64s)]
*  I mean, seriously, seriously, after the Iraq war, you're going back to this sack of crap? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=620.84s)]
*  You saw him in that interview. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=628.04s)]
*  He said, well, once the ayatollah is taken out, everything's gonna be solved. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=629.04s)]
*  Yeah, cuz the Iranian people, and they say this was a straight face, I was on Piers Morgan [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=634.0s)]
*  this morning debating a bunch of these clowns, okay? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=637.48s)]
*  No, then the Iranian people will welcome us. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=640.1999999999999s)]
*  Of course, when you drop a bomb on somebody's family, they say, come on in, please run our [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=644.36s)]
*  country too. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=650.0s)]
*  We would love it. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=651.4399999999999s)]
*  No, us fight, you know way. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=652.4399999999999s)]
*  No, we'll just surrender right away. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=654.0s)]
*  So all of this is obvious propaganda. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=656.92s)]
*  So Sharon, what's happening now is amazing. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=661.38s)]
*  Because as we're gonna talk about a little bit later in the show, MAG is an open revolt. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=664.9s)]
*  The Libertarians have already left the building. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=668.16s)]
*  And there's now memes around Libertarians and progressives clasping hands in the anti-war [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=671.1999999999999s)]
*  movement. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=676.88s)]
*  We're done with this, right? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=677.88s)]
*  And of course, what is the answer that Israel supporters have for all of us, all the American [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=680.1999999999999s)]
*  voters who don't want this? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=684.46s)]
*  Anti-Semites, all of America's anti-Semites. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=687.02s)]
*  And if we don't wanna be called anti-Semites, we better give them another $300 billion. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=690.94s)]
*  We better spend another couple of trillion dollars on another war. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=695.7s)]
*  We better take out all of their enemies. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=698.72s)]
*  We better do all of their bidding. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=700.5400000000001s)]
*  Otherwise, congratulations, right wing Libertarians, you're now all anti-Semites. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=702.58s)]
*  So man, they keep messing around, to put it politely. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=708.14s)]
*  And politically here in America, Sharon, I believe they're about to find out. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=714.42s)]
*  Yeah, I think you're right. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=719.74s)]
*  And we'll move on, but just another quick follow up here with Israel seemingly puppeting [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=721.5s)]
*  the Trump administration. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=726.62s)]
*  Is there, and you have the president, of course, who is the ultimate back and forth guy. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=728.1s)]
*  Is there enough talent though to keep us out of this escalation here, or do you see it [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=732.9599999999999s)]
*  as inevitable? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=740.04s)]
*  Well, the problem is that over 300 members of Congress, that is the overwhelming majority [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=741.04s)]
*  of the House of Representatives, are funded by AIPAC. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=748.7199999999999s)]
*  So now mainstream media, there's two hilarious things. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=753.38s)]
*  One is they're like, no, I don't see it. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=756.5999999999999s)]
*  Even though AIPAC was the number one donor in this election cycle, they're like, no, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=759.92s)]
*  I don't see it. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=763.92s)]
*  Not only do I not see it, and number two, politicians are angels. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=765.0s)]
*  They're so moral, they would never be affected by the millions of dollars AIPAC's giving [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=770.32s)]
*  them. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=774.76s)]
*  I mean, these are reporters saying this. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=775.76s)]
*  If it wasn't so tragic, it would be absolutely riotously funny, right? [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=780.52s)]
*  Okay, and number three, if you mentioned the fact that AIPAC is the number one donor, and [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=786.1999999999999s)]
*  that politicians might be affected by millions of dollars, anti-Semite. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=791.28s)]
*  Okay, so congratulations America, everyone outside of the politicians that AIPAC bought [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=796.64s)]
*  in Congress, which is the great majority of them, and Joe Biden and Donald Trump. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=803.16s)]
*  The rest of us are all anti-Semites. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=807.8199999999999s)]
*  So we better hurry up and bow our heads to that foreign government. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=810.0799999999999s)]
*  Otherwise, we're all bigots and racists. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=813.16s)]
*  I mean, that's what the people in media tell me. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=815.8s)]
*  That's what the politicians tell me. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=818.84s)]
*  Okay, so one more thing about the media. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=820.24s)]
*  I wrote on social media, at Jen Huber on X. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=822.24s)]
*  I said, look, I'll predict it ahead of time for you guys. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=826.6s)]
*  What they're gonna do is, and this was like as soon as the war started, I said this. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=829.16s)]
*  They will ignore the civilians killed in Iraq. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=833.88s)]
*  And it took me a couple of days to find an article that finally said, right, by the way, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=837.76s)]
*  90% of the people killed in the Israeli attack were civilians, over 200 dead civilians, women [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=842.64s)]
*  and children, right? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=847.4s)]
*  But for the first 48 hours, no talk of civilian deaths among the Iranians. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=848.5600000000001s)]
*  Do you see cable news covering a lot of civilian deaths in Iran? [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=853.12s)]
*  Nothing, zero, zero, right? [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=855.88s)]
*  We had to go abroad to find that clip for you, okay? [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=858.08s)]
*  And there's a couple of places, right? [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=860.76s)]
*  But American media, no. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=863.1s)]
*  But the minute an Israeli house got hit. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=864.46s)]
*  Israel is the victims. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=867.24s)]
*  Let's put a camera in front of this person's face. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=873.36s)]
*  And mind you, that person is a victim of war. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=875.64s)]
*  And I don't want that. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=878.76s)]
*  I don't want any civilians getting hurt. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=879.76s)]
*  I don't want any houses getting knocked down. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=880.76s)]
*  At the same time, if you're an Israeli supporter, first of all, you're never gonna acknowledge [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=883.12s)]
*  anything. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=886.6800000000001s)]
*  But if you're a rational human being, you would have to say, wait, that person is complaining [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=887.6800000000001s)]
*  about their house being knocked down. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=892.02s)]
*  Can I get one reporter to ask, have you seen Gaza? [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=895.0s)]
*  Have you seen Gaza? [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=899.84s)]
*  All of the houses are knocked out. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=901.96s)]
*  And you did that. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=903.72s)]
*  And you didn't seem to have any problem with that. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=904.72s)]
*  But one house or two, a couple of houses in Tel Aviv are knocked out. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=907.6s)]
*  No, no, we're victims. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=910.76s)]
*  I mean, we just started a war. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=912.64s)]
*  And now two of their missiles got through. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=915.8000000000001s)]
*  How dare they? [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=919.0400000000001s)]
*  How dare they fight back? [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=920.96s)]
*  Those should know when they're conquered. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=923.22s)]
*  Plus, let's murder their leader, take over their government. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=925.1800000000001s)]
*  I mean, we're not gonna do it. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=928.9s)]
*  America, you do it and you pay for it. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=930.4200000000001s)]
*  No, no, this is wearing super thin. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=932.38s)]
*  Mainstream media has no credibility anymore as they tell us that the guys who started [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=935.94s)]
*  the war are doing it for self-defense. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=941.62s)]
*  I mean, and look, I'm not saying this is an analogy. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=943.4200000000001s)]
*  You take it for whatever you like. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=949.12s)]
*  But literally every aggressor in the history of the world has said that they were doing [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=950.74s)]
*  it for self-defense. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=955.12s)]
*  Even the Germans said that they had to defend fellow Germans in the Sudetenland. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=956.96s)]
*  It was for self-defense, otherwise they were gonna get attacked. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=963.38s)]
*  They said the same thing about Poland. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=967.46s)]
*  They said the same thing about every country they attacked. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=968.84s)]
*  It was a preemptive war. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=971.46s)]
*  We had to do it for self-defense. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=974.46s)]
*  And so here we are with Israel saying the same thing. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=978.28s)]
*  Now, you could choose to believe them if you're a sucker or you're blinded by bias, but the [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=981.56s)]
*  rest of us have had enough. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=986.8399999999999s)]
*  And as usual, if you wanna know the actual facts, yes, Israel has killed 10 times the [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=989.16s)]
*  number of civilians in Iran as Iran has killed Israelis. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=995.5s)]
*  You'll probably never hear that in mainstream media, but that's a fact and you can go look [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=1000.32s)]
*  it up. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjNp8RH0EFk&t=1004.2800000000001s)]
