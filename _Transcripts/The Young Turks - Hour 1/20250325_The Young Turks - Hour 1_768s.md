# Columbia Student Fights Back After Being Threatened with Deportation by Trump
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [March 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI)
*  21 year old Columbia University student Monday filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=0.0s)]
*  which is seeking to deport her for participating in Palestinian rights protests on campus. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=7.74s)]
*  The Trump administration is targeting Chung under a rarely used provision of the Immigration [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=14.06s)]
*  and Nationality Act of 1952, which gives the Secretary of State authority to begin deportation [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=19.54s)]
*  proceedings against any non-citizen deemed a threat to US foreign policy interests. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=27.66s)]
*  Yes, a 21 year old high school valedictorian who's now a Columbia University student is [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=34.18s)]
*  a real threat to national security. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=40.46s)]
*  We must do something about it. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=42.9s)]
*  Now, of course, the Trump administration is continuing their attack on legal immigrants [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=44.7s)]
*  and now they're getting sued for it. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=50.019999999999996s)]
*  So Eunice Chung, or Chung I should say, is a Columbia University junior and a permanent [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=52.82s)]
*  legal resident who was informed that her green card is getting revoked. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=58.94s)]
*  And now she has decided to challenge the Trump administration and their deportation order [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=64.16s)]
*  in court through this lawsuit. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=68.22s)]
*  Now the Department of Homeland Security is claiming that this 21 year old has engaged [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=70.62s)]
*  in concerning conduct, Cenk, concerning conduct. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=74.78s)]
*  Yeah, and it is concerning to Israel. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=78.17999999999999s)]
*  So obviously our government has to do whatever the Israeli government wants. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=80.82s)]
*  So now we're literally rounding up people. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=84.33999999999999s)]
*  You're gonna see in this story, they went to her parents' house, they went to several [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=87.02s)]
*  different places. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=92.38s)]
*  And right now she's hiding, maybe in an attic somewhere like Anne Frank. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=93.94s)]
*  And because the Israeli thought police have been sent after her. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=98.78s)]
*  And so now, by the way, legal resident has the same constitutional rights as any American [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=106.14s)]
*  does. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=111.41999999999999s)]
*  But she criticized Israel and that apparently is now the biggest crime in America. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=112.91999999999999s)]
*  It'll literally get you deported even if you're a legal resident. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=117.82s)]
*  And you tell me Israel's not in charge of our government, come on. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=122.1s)]
*  You'd have to be the biggest sucker in the world to believe that. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=126.41999999999999s)]
*  Now more details. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=130.29999999999998s)]
*  So she was part of a Barnard College sit-in on March 5th. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=131.3s)]
*  At that point, more than 200 protesters were occupying the Milstein Library at the college. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=136.62s)]
*  She was part of the group of protesters right outside who were also protesting. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=142.54000000000002s)]
*  Now the demonstration was meant to protest the way Israel is prosecuting this war in [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=148.94s)]
*  Gaza which has been brutal, which has led to the slaughter of tens of thousands of innocent [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=153.98000000000002s)]
*  people including women, children, elderly individuals. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=158.06s)]
*  But in addition to that, they were also protesting the expulsion of two other Barnard students [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=162.1s)]
*  who had interrupted a Columbia University class on modern Israel. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=170.1s)]
*  They had tossed around some flyers. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=174.94s)]
*  They got expelled for that. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=177.54s)]
*  Prior to that, they had already faced suspension for engaging in similar behavior. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=179.02s)]
*  By the way, some of the flyers that they were throwing around had some questionable imagery [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=184.42s)]
*  on it. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=189.7s)]
*  One had a boot stomping on the Star of David that said crush Zionism. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=190.7s)]
*  Now those two students again had been expelled. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=194.14s)]
*  But the heart of the protest was really about what's happening in Gaza. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=197.01999999999998s)]
*  And as we've learned through the treatment of Mahmoud Galil, we just can't have that. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=202.01999999999998s)]
*  And so now you need the Gestapo to show up and threaten to deport you and take your green [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=207.06s)]
*  card away. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=211.38s)]
*  Now she was accused by the university of joining other students in posting flyers that pictured [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=212.38s)]
*  members of Columbia's Board of Trustees with the phrase wanted for complicity in genocide. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=217.01999999999998s)]
*  Wow, sounds like a real national security threat. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=222.74s)]
*  But according to Chung's lawsuit, the school didn't even find that she had violated any [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=225.9s)]
*  of its applicable policies. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=231.57999999999998s)]
*  She didn't get in trouble for doing that because guess what? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=233.98s)]
*  That is practicing your freedom of expression. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=236.38s)]
*  But the Trump administration doesn't care and DHS spokesperson Trisha McLaughlin makes [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=238.73999999999998s)]
*  clear that they're just gonna continue conflating Hamas with Palestinian civilians. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=244.17999999999998s)]
*  She released a statement saying, Yun Seo Chung has engaged in concerning conduct including [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=249.98s)]
*  when she was arrested by NYPD during a pro Hamas protest at the college. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=257.3s)]
*  And the Trump administration is arguing that her presence in the United States hinders [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=263.09999999999997s)]
*  the administration's foreign policy agenda of halting the spread of anti-Semitism. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=266.5s)]
*  Okay, but clearly she's not really a threat to anyone at all. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=270.9s)]
*  She was charged with obstructing governmental administration and issued a desk appearance [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=276.42s)]
*  ticket by the NYPD. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=282.1s)]
*  And her family had immigrated here to the United States when she was just seven years [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=285.18s)]
*  old. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=288.78s)]
*  As I mentioned, she's a permanent resident, green card holder. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=289.78s)]
*  She was also valedictoried in high school, which that's where the real terror lies in [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=292.42s)]
*  this country. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=296.58s)]
*  So where is she now? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=297.58s)]
*  As Cenk had alluded to earlier, she seems to be in hiding. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=299.02s)]
*  She isn't currently in ICE detention. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=302.74s)]
*  Immigration agents did visit her home looking for her, which is kind of rare considering [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=305.86s)]
*  the fact that ICE agents usually like to just show up to the prisons and arrest or detain [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=309.9s)]
*  undocumented immigrants there. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=315.7s)]
*  It takes a lot more time and resources to do an investigation and to search people's [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=317.3s)]
*  homes. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=321.21999999999997s)]
*  But she did that when it comes to Chung. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=322.22s)]
*  Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials visited several residences, called for help [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=324.70000000000005s)]
*  from federal prosecutors, and searched her university housing on March 13th. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=328.32000000000005s)]
*  Agents apparently seeking her searched two residents on the Columbia campus with warrants [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=333.90000000000003s)]
*  that cited a criminal law known as the Harboring Statute aimed at those who give shelter to [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=339.54s)]
*  non-citizens present in the United States illegally. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=344.90000000000003s)]
*  Although she's not in the United States illegally, she's in the United States completely legally. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=348.78000000000003s)]
*  She's a permanent US resident. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=352.98s)]
*  Yeah, so number one, it was not a pro-Hamas protest. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=354.82s)]
*  That's just a flat out lie. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=358.18s)]
*  It was a protest against Israel, but any protest of Israel is now considered terrorism, right? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=360.02s)]
*  Lock them up. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=366.1s)]
*  Or pro-Hamas. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=367.1s)]
*  You're pro-Hamas if you don't say that Israel should keep slaughtering innocent Palestinian [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=368.1s)]
*  children and women and grandmothers, etc. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=372.94s)]
*  Anti-Semitism, they say, is why they're doing this. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=375.82s)]
*  Wait, I thought it was a national security problem. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=378.34s)]
*  First of all, again, legal residents have the same exact rights of freedom of speech [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=382.53999999999996s)]
*  as US citizens do. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=387.34s)]
*  The Supreme Court has held that for over 200 years. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=389.94s)]
*  There's no question about that. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=393.38s)]
*  There's no lack of clarity. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=394.62s)]
*  So I don't know what she's, Zionism and all that, the Boothons, I don't like it. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=395.62s)]
*  It's not how I would deal with it. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=400.03999999999996s)]
*  But who cares? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=402.02s)]
*  She has a freedom of speech, freedom of expression. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=403.02s)]
*  She can say anything she wants about Zionism, right? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=405.34s)]
*  And by the way, you guys, she came at seven. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=407.94s)]
*  I came at eight from Turkey. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=409.58s)]
*  She came from South Korea. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=411.02s)]
*  And she grew up here, I grew up here. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=412.64s)]
*  And I got a green card right around when, I'm sorry, I became a citizen right around [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=415.42s)]
*  her age, right? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=420.02s)]
*  So she's as American as I am. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=422.1s)]
*  She's as American as anyone, right? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=424.46s)]
*  In terms of her culture and where she grew up. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=426.54s)]
*  If you sent her back to South Korea, she's gonna be like, what the hell is, she doesn't [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=429.46s)]
*  live in that country. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=433.54s)]
*  She's never lived in that country, right? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=434.54s)]
*  Except for a time she could barely remember. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=436.58s)]
*  So she's not gonna have anywhere to go. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=438.9s)]
*  This is insanity. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=440.9s)]
*  Listen, I get that supporters of the Trump administration don't give a damn at all about [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=441.9s)]
*  what happens to this woman. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=447.3s)]
*  They don't care about the deterioration of free expression or due process, by the way, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=448.46s)]
*  as long as they get to continue defending any action the Trump administration takes. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=454.18s)]
*  But if that's the case, I don't wanna hear a word from those folks about the importance [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=458.36s)]
*  of free speech. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=463.26s)]
*  When someone on the right feels that their speech is being, or speech rights, I should [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=464.46s)]
*  say, is being violated by a Democratic politician, okay? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=469.34s)]
*  We defend the individuals who have their speech violated by politicians, regardless of which [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=473.14s)]
*  party we're talking about here. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=478.9s)]
*  But we don't have a system now where we have consistency. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=480.82s)]
*  It's all about your tribe and defending your tribe, even when they engage in the behavior [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=484.58s)]
*  that you've criticized the other tribe for. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=488.78s)]
*  So as long as they just stop pretending like they care about freedom of speech, fine. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=490.9s)]
*  But that's the thing, they won't shut up about how much they care about freedom of speech. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=496.09999999999997s)]
*  The whole point about defending people you disagree, speech you disagree with, is because [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=499.97999999999996s)]
*  you're showing that you actually value that right, that you believe in that constitutional [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=505.5s)]
*  right, that you're gonna fight for it for everyone, regardless of what that expression [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=510.65999999999997s)]
*  is communicating, okay? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=515.66s)]
*  There are all sorts of people in this country who communicate for a living, and they say [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=517.58s)]
*  all sorts of garbage that I don't agree with. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=521.5400000000001s)]
*  If the Biden administration, if the Obama administration, if some Democrat violated [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=524.3000000000001s)]
*  their freedom of speech, I'm not gonna sit there and defend them for doing so. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=527.86s)]
*  Because I actually give a damn about our constitution, I give a damn about our rights. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=531.1800000000001s)]
*  And if you're unwilling to defend those who are having their rights violated, you have [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=534.72s)]
*  to shut up if your rights are being violated in a similar way. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=538.94s)]
*  Because you sat there and aided and abetted the deterioration of our constitutional rights. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=542.34s)]
*  Yeah, 100%. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=547.5s)]
*  Look, the right-wing reaction here has been super disappointing. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=548.5s)]
*  Super disappointing. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=551.82s)]
*  So now you can say, Cenk, it was obvious, not necessarily. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=552.82s)]
*  So I said they would rebel a little bit on the issue of Gaza and Israel, and they did. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=556.62s)]
*  Not a lot, but a little bit. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=561.5s)]
*  When Trump said, we're gonna send our guys there to Gaza to clear out the unexploded [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=562.54s)]
*  bombs and drive out the Palestinians. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=566.58s)]
*  The reason he changed his mind within 24 hours is because his base rebelled and was like, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=569.7s)]
*  I can go to Gaza and deal with Israel's unexploded bombs, right? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=573.66s)]
*  And so then I was a little bit encouraged, right? [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=578.06s)]
*  And this is a core First Amendment issue. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=581.14s)]
*  Freedom of speech, the thing that they said they cared most about, right? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=582.94s)]
*  The reaction so far honestly has been- It's pathetic. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=586.78s)]
*  Wall to wall, who cares, she's not a citizen. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=589.66s)]
*  But wait, first of all, it's not even about her. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=593.08s)]
*  It's about, are we gonna protect that right? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=596.38s)]
*  So if you say, hey, when they came for people with student visas, it didn't matter because [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=599.12s)]
*  I didn't have a student visa. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=604.4s)]
*  When they came for legal residents, I didn't care cuz I'm not a legal resident. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=606.0600000000001s)]
*  Don't be surprised that when they come for you, there's no one left to defend you. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=610.48s)]
*  And so, and the second hypocrisy of the right wing on this is, America first. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=614.8s)]
*  Now they're like- No, but we're not America first. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=619.7s)]
*  But we're not, and you know it. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=621.36s)]
*  If you're a right winger, you know we're not America first. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=623.08s)]
*  You know we're Israel first. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=626.12s)]
*  You don't get kicked out of the country. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=627.6800000000001s)]
*  If you have a student visa or you're a legal resident, if you criticize America, you can [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=628.96s)]
*  criticize America all day, all night, which you should be able to. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=632.96s)]
*  That's your first amendment right? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=635.96s)]
*  You can criticize any other ally. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=636.96s)]
*  You can criticize any other religion, any other group. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=639.0s)]
*  We're really concerned about anti-Semitism. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=642.52s)]
*  Well, how about anti-Muslim comments made by the other side? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=643.76s)]
*  How about the Israeli supporters who ran over kids in Colombia with their car? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=647.2800000000001s)]
*  How about the guys who attacked the UCLA students who are peace protesters? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=652.82s)]
*  There's nobody getting kicked out of the country for that. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=656.88s)]
*  Can you insult other allies of America without it being a national security issue? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=660.0400000000001s)]
*  Of course you can. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=663.36s)]
*  You can criticize Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Germany, France, Canada, Mexico, anyone you like. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=664.36s)]
*  The only country you're not allowed to criticize is Israel. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=669.36s)]
*  You're telling me that you don't see that? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=672.44s)]
*  If you're a mainstream media reporter saying, no, I don't see it. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=674.96s)]
*  I don't see it. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=677.48s)]
*  You're a fool. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=678.48s)]
*  You're embarrassing and humiliating yourself. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=679.48s)]
*  And if you're a right winger and you say, no, no, no, but America being second is not [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=682.0600000000001s)]
*  so bad. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=685.64s)]
*  And maybe we should take away some of our freedom of speech as long as, no, I want to [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=686.68s)]
*  be able to say nasty things and terrible things about my opponents. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=690.48s)]
*  And I want to have the right to say anything. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=694.36s)]
*  But if Trump takes away your rights to criticize Israel, I'm okay with it. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=696.42s)]
*  You never meant it. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=701.46s)]
*  You never meant any of the so-called principles you had. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=702.46s)]
*  You just wanted power, etc. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=705.4399999999999s)]
*  Look, I hope that eventually there'll be enough. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=707.24s)]
*  I mean, I'm worried that there's going to be so much of this. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=710.56s)]
*  They're going to keep rounding people up on behalf of Israel. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=714.82s)]
*  They will. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=717.34s)]
*  They will. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=718.34s)]
*  There's nothing you can do about it. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=719.34s)]
*  At some point, it's going to break and it's going to go in the other direction. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=720.34s)]
*  But for now, no, Israel is totally in charge of this country. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=724.2600000000001s)]
*  And they'll deport anyone who criticizes them that isn't a US citizen. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=728.38s)]
*  But don't worry, they'll come for us too. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=734.08s)]
*  So a judge has just issued a temporary restraining order stopping the Trump administration from [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=737.24s)]
*  detaining Chung. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=743.0999999999999s)]
*  So we'll see how this case plays out in the courts. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=745.14s)]
*  But obviously, she is not taking this from the Trump administration. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=747.9799999999999s)]
*  She's fighting back through the courts as pretty much everyone is fighting back through the [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=752.26s)]
*  courts because what are you going to do? [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=756.02s)]
*  You're going to rely on Congress to do the right thing? [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=757.02s)]
*  They're useless, but we're paying their salaries anyway. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOkaRunBPI&t=759.3s)]
