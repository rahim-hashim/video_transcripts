"Donald Trump said on Saturday his relationship with his billionaire donor Elon Musk is over and warned there would be "serious consequences" if Musk funds U.S. Democrats running against Republicans who vote for the president's sweeping tax and spending bill.
In a telephone interview with NBC News, Trump declined to say what those consequences would be, and went on to add that he had not had discussions about whether to investigate Musk."*

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.
Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.
Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

# PATHETIC New Twist In The Musk VS Trump Drama
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8)
*  Last week, President Donald Trump and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=0.0s)]
*  Elon Musk had an epic, epic falling [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=2.52s)]
*  out. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=5.0600000000000005s)]
*  It was so epic and I hated that it [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=5.64s)]
*  happened on a Friday when I wasn't [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=7.4s)]
*  on the show. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=9.4s)]
*  Now Elon Musk is signaling that he [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=10.74s)]
*  is ready to move on from the feud. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=12.98s)]
*  Seems like he kind of wants to make [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=15.780000000000001s)]
*  amends, but Trump doesn't seem like [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=17.740000000000002s)]
*  he wants to bury the hatchet anytime [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=19.84s)]
*  soon. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=21.92s)]
*  So before we get to Trump's feud [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=22.82s)]
*  with Elon Musk, it is worth noting [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=25.18s)]
*  that, I don't know what some [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=27.84s)]
*  Democrats are up to, but some [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=30.26s)]
*  Democrats, like Congressman Ro Khanna [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=32.7s)]
*  are now trying to lure Musk to [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=35.980000000000004s)]
*  the left, don't do it, don't do it. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=38.38s)]
*  Having Elon Musk speak out against [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=41.620000000000005s)]
*  the irrational tariff policy, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=43.96s)]
*  against the deficit exploding [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=46.04s)]
*  Trump's bill, and the anti-science [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=48.2s)]
*  and anti-immigrant agenda can help [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=50.74s)]
*  check Trump's unconstitutional [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=53.019999999999996s)]
*  administration. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=55.14s)]
*  He referred to Elon turning his [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=56.36000000000001s)]
*  fire against mega Republicans [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=58.260000000000005s)]
*  instead of Democrats in 2026. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=60.06s)]
*  And he did get some backlash for [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=62.06s)]
*  that, that was a comment he gave to [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=64.12s)]
*  Semaphore. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=66.4s)]
*  And in response to the backlash, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=67.66s)]
*  he says, if Biden had a big [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=69.60000000000001s)]
*  supporter criticize him, Trump [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=71.06s)]
*  would have hugged him the next day. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=72.94s)]
*  When we refuse to meet with Robert [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=74.80000000000001s)]
*  Kennedy or RFK Jr., Trump embraced [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=77.2s)]
*  him and won, we can be the party of [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=79.74000000000001s)]
*  sanctimonious lectures or [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=82.28s)]
*  the party of FDR that knows how to [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=84.32000000000001s)]
*  win and build a progressive [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=86.68s)]
*  majority. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=88.5s)]
*  Look, in other contexts, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=89.16s)]
*  I can agree with Ro Khanna, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=90.88s)]
*  not in this context. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=92.7s)]
*  And Elon Musk, by the way, was [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=94.08s)]
*  a political liability for [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=95.88s)]
*  Trump to some extent. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=97.44s)]
*  Why do we want that political [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=98.8s)]
*  liability? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=100.32s)]
*  I don't understand. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=100.92s)]
*  Was, what do you think? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=101.92s)]
*  Yeah, what's worked out so [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=103.04s)]
*  great by Trump having taken [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=105.48s)]
*  Elon's money? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=108.32s)]
*  They basically tied the deal with [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=109.76s)]
*  them and they basically tied [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=112.96000000000001s)]
*  themselves in not to defend every [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=115.68s)]
*  single ridiculous element that [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=118.72s)]
*  Elon represents. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=121.52s)]
*  And more importantly, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=123.28s)]
*  Elon Musk is an ideologue. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=125.32000000000001s)]
*  This dude is a libertarian maniac. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=127.76s)]
*  And that does not align with the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=130.48s)]
*  goals, aims, and ambitions of any [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=133.12s)]
*  progressive or left leaning person [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=136.0s)]
*  in this country. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=138.92000000000002s)]
*  So I understand what he's saying, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=140.72s)]
*  particularly with RFK. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=142.84s)]
*  The dude was literally, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=145.07999999999998s)]
*  he's literally a born and [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=146.92s)]
*  bred Democrat. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=148.6s)]
*  I can understand that. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=150.88s)]
*  But Elon Musk is a right wing [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=153.56s)]
*  libertarian psychopath. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=156.07999999999998s)]
*  There's just no upside to aligning [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=159.32s)]
*  with that dude. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=161.23999999999998s)]
*  And we have plenty of those in [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=162.56s)]
*  the Democratic Party already. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=163.6s)]
*  We don't need more of them. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=164.79999999999998s)]
*  So anyway, now let's move over to [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=165.92s)]
*  Trump because asked by NBC News on [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=168.32s)]
*  Saturday, if Trump was concerned [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=171.44s)]
*  that Musk could start funding [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=173.68s)]
*  Democratic candidates, Trump said [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=175.72s)]
*  he'll have to pay very serious [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=178.36s)]
*  consequences if he does that. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=180.56s)]
*  Which is a nefarious and kind of [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=183.20000000000002s)]
*  gross thing to say. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=185.20000000000002s)]
*  Look, I don't care about Elon Musk's [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=186.60000000000002s)]
*  money, I don't care about funding [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=189.12s)]
*  Democrats. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=191.4s)]
*  I do care about that threat. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=192.48000000000002s)]
*  What is that threat? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=194.36s)]
*  I mean, I'm not a fan of Elon Musk, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=196.04000000000002s)]
*  but he's free to contribute money [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=197.96s)]
*  to whatever candidate or [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=199.92000000000002s)]
*  political party he chooses. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=201.20000000000002s)]
*  What are you going to do? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=203.24s)]
*  You're going to send the Marines to [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=204.4s)]
*  go after Elon Musk? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=205.60000000000002s)]
*  Is that what you're going to do? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=206.56s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=207.44s)]
*  So obviously, things are not really [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=209.76000000000002s)]
*  dying down between the two of them [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=213.52s)]
*  in regard to this feud. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=215.56s)]
*  Trump also stated that he had no [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=216.72000000000003s)]
*  reaction or no reason, I should [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=218.84s)]
*  say, to make amends with Elon Musk [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=220.72000000000003s)]
*  saying I'm too busy doing other [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=222.84s)]
*  things. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=224.4s)]
*  I won an election in a landslide. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=224.92000000000002s)]
*  I gave him a lot of, this guy, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=228.56s)]
*  I gave him a lot of breaks long [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=230.48000000000002s)]
*  before this happened. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=232.48000000000002s)]
*  I think it's a very bad thing [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=234.08s)]
*  because he's very disrespectful. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=235.96s)]
*  Trump really does care about [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=238.48000000000002s)]
*  respectful conduct. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=240.4s)]
*  And then he finishes that off by [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=242.0s)]
*  saying you could not disrespect [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=243.96s)]

*  Right, because he's never done [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=249.16000000000003s)]
*  that, by the way. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=250.76000000000002s)]
*  Trump is always very respectful to [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=251.72s)]
*  the office of the president. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=253.64000000000001s)]
*  And when asked if his relationship [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=255.12s)]
*  with Elon Musk was over, he said, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=257.32s)]
*  I would assume so. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=259.67999999999995s)]
*  And I don't blame him for [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=261.08s)]
*  not wanting to make amends with [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=262.55999999999995s)]
*  Elon Musk, I want to be clear. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=264.4s)]
*  Because Musk indirectly called him [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=266.32s)]
*  a pedophile, but he did that. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=268.96s)]
*  And what I want to know is, is he? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=272.4s)]
*  Can we see the Epstein files that [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=277.79999999999995s)]
*  were promised to us when Trump was [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=279.59999999999997s)]
*  running for president? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=281.35999999999996s)]
*  We're not going to see the Epstein [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=283.64s)]
*  files? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=284.84s)]
*  That's a bit of a problem. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=285.34s)]
*  I think that's a bit of a problem. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=285.96s)]
*  Waz, back over to you. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=287.08s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know why he would [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=289.47999999999996s)]
*  want to make amends with Elon. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=291.76s)]
*  The guy is erratic and [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=294.2s)]
*  you can't count on him. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=295.8s)]
*  He's unreliable. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=297.64s)]
*  What's the point of this dude? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=300.24s)]
*  Yeah, they got their 300 million, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=302.56s)]
*  which again, be reminded, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=305.4s)]
*  Elon Musk has gotten billions of [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=307.53999999999996s)]
*  government contract funding, okay? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=310.2s)]
*  This guy has more than made his [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=313.36s)]
*  money back. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=316.08s)]
*  Yes, he definitely rejiggered [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=317.44s)]
*  the algorithm for [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=319.67999999999995s)]
*  the Twitter propaganda machine to [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=321.11999999999995s)]
*  more favor Trump and Republicans, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=323.64s)]
*  which I think is genuinely helpful. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=326.4s)]
*  I don't know that Trump couldn't [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=328.4s)]
*  have won the election if Jack [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=330.32s)]
*  Smith and his lib homies were still [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=332.0s)]
*  running Twitter. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=334.15999999999997s)]
*  I'm not sure, I mean, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=335.55999999999995s)]
*  he won in 2016 when that was [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=336.91999999999996s)]
*  the case, right? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=338.67999999999995s)]
*  But I do think it definitely helped. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=340.12s)]
*  It didn't hurt him to have Elon [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=342.23999999999995s)]
*  putting his thumb on the scale on [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=344.52s)]
*  the Twitter thing. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=346.76s)]
*  I just think if you're Trump and [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=348.08s)]
*  you went out and [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=350.32s)]
*  convince 80 million people to leave [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=351.41999999999996s)]
*  their crib and cast a vote for you, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=353.88s)]
*  you clearly have more presence, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=356.4s)]
*  more charisma. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=358.96s)]
*  You clearly have people who [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=360.0s)]
*  actually like you and [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=362.23999999999995s)]
*  not just strange folks who [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=364.15999999999997s)]
*  anonymously like the tweet on [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=366.71999999999997s)]
*  Twitter. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=369.67999999999995s)]
*  At a certain point, it's like, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=370.6s)]
*  Elon, we got what we needed out of [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=372.32s)]
*  you, you got what you needed out of [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=374.12s)]
*  us, go disappear somewhere, okay? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=375.92s)]
*  Go actually do your job somewhere [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=378.12s)]
*  and just move on. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=380.36s)]
*  I think it's best to just wipe [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=381.52s)]
*  your hands and just be like, all [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=383.08s)]
*  right, man, let's pretend this [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=384.76s)]
*  never happened. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=386.24s)]
*  Because if you don't, it kind of [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=387.0s)]
*  begs the question, Ana, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=388.96s)]
*  Elon's disrespectful, Elon's erratic, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=390.4s)]
*  Elon is lucky we gave him all these [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=392.8s)]
*  countries. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=394.84000000000003s)]
*  Well, why the hell did you empower [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=395.44s)]
*  him? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=397.08s)]
*  He's a man of power. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=397.58s)]
*  All these countries. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=398.52000000000004s)]
*  Well, why the hell did you empower [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=399.28000000000003s)]
*  Elon in the first place? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=400.72s)]
*  Yeah, it's a good point. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=401.88s)]
*  In fact, the Washington Post has [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=403.32s)]
*  reported that Trump even called [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=407.48s)]
*  Musk a big time drug addict. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=411.16s)]
*  In at least one private phone call [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=414.68s)]
*  over the weekend. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=417.04s)]
*  By the way, okay, so that press [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=418.48s)]
*  conference with Trump and [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=420.52000000000004s)]
*  Elon Musk a few days prior to [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=422.38s)]
*  things really exploding. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=424.32s)]
*  So my husband sent a video of just [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=425.88s)]
*  it was zoomed in on Elon Musk's [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=428.64s)]
*  face. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=431.12s)]
*  And I was like, babe, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=431.64s)]
*  this looks like a fake video. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=433.0s)]
*  I don't think this is real. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=434.8s)]
*  And he's like, yeah, I was thinking [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=436.32s)]
*  it wasn't real either. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=437.88s)]
*  Can you look into it for me? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=438.8s)]
*  Because I want to know if it's [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=439.84s)]
*  real. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=441.24s)]
*  So Elon, he's got like a, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=441.8s)]
*  it looks like a black eye. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=443.08s)]
*  He's like twitching, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=444.32s)]
*  his face is twitching. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=445.56s)]
*  He's like, I'm like, this isn't [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=446.64s)]
*  real, guys, it's real. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=450.32s)]
*  I watched the whole press [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=452.96s)]
*  conference with him. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=454.36s)]
*  It's real, my gosh. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=455.64000000000004s)]
*  Ro, we don't want him. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=459.28000000000003s)]
*  You don't want him. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=461.68s)]
*  No. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=462.36s)]
*  And I really like Ro Khanna. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=463.04s)]
*  I think he's one of the good ones. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=466.32000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. And I understand the instinct [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=468.24s)]
*  to be like, the enemy of my enemy [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=470.44s)]
*  and that kind of thing. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=472.52000000000004s)]
*  But I just think Elon specifically [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=475.04s)]
*  sucks. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=477.96000000000004s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=479.20000000000005s)]
*  It's one thing for [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=481.0s)]
*  Jack Jeffries to be dying to get [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=481.92s)]
*  back in the good graces of [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=483.76000000000005s)]
*  David Sacks and all these other [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=485.72s)]
*  Silicon Valley weird old dork dudes. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=487.68s)]
*  But Elon specifically, again, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=490.32s)]
*  I think what I think how Jeffries [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=493.8s)]
*  is out of his mind too. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=496.52s)]
*  But Elon is like, bruh. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=498.40000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=501.08s)]
*  Stay away. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=501.72s)]
*  We get it. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=503.48s)]
*  He's got issues. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=504.08s)]
*  He's rich as hell. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=504.8s)]
*  He owns a very powerful propaganda [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=506.12s)]
*  tool, but he sucks and [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=509.12s)]
*  he's unreliable. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=510.92s)]
*  So it looks like Elon Musk is kind [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=513.3199999999999s)]
*  of trying to take a different tone [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=515.8s)]
*  with Trump. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=518.5999999999999s)]
*  So for instance, on Friday, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=520.0799999999999s)]
*  he wrote the following on X. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=522.0799999999999s)]
*  I will apologize profusely to [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=524.04s)]
*  Donald Trump, he means, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=526.0799999999999s)]
*  as soon as there is a full dump of [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=527.88s)]
*  the Epstein files. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=530.04s)]
*  Interesting, okay, well, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=532.2399999999999s)]
*  that's not going to happen, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=533.5999999999999s)]
*  which I think is an injustice. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=535.1199999999999s)]
*  Musk later deleted that post. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=537.04s)]
*  He also deleted the post in which [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=539.8s)]
*  Musk accused Trump of being on [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=542.4000000000001s)]
*  the Epstein files. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=544.72s)]
*  That was the initial explosive [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=546.6s)]
*  tweet, or post I should say. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=548.6400000000001s)]
*  And then later during this past [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=551.08s)]
*  weekend, he had an interesting [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=553.12s)]
*  reaction to a clip of JD Vance [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=555.08s)]
*  saying that Musk could get back in [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=556.9200000000001s)]
*  Trump's good graces. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=559.12s)]
*  And he just responded with cool. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=560.6400000000001s)]
*  Okay, so do you want to get in [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=566.08s)]
*  Trump's good graces? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=567.4000000000001s)]
*  Now yesterday, he reposted two of [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=568.84s)]
*  Trump's truth social messages about [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=571.0799999999999s)]
*  the riots happening in Los Angeles. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=573.3199999999999s)]
*  Here's one example, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=575.4s)]
*  Governor Gavin Newsom and [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=576.5999999999999s)]
*  Mayor Karen Bass should apologize [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=578.0799999999999s)]
*  to the people of Los Angeles for [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=580.0799999999999s)]
*  absolutely doing a horrible job. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=581.68s)]
*  Whatever, you get the point. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=583.36s)]
*  Elon Musk obviously posted it [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=585.0799999999999s)]
*  because he agrees with it. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=586.48s)]
*  So maybe that was him extending an [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=587.5999999999999s)]
*  olive branch. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=589.16s)]
*  And then Senator Ted Cruz and [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=590.48s)]
*  all of the other cucks in the [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=592.12s)]
*  Republican Party are really hoping [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=593.5999999999999s)]
*  and praying that Trump and [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=595.64s)]
*  Elon Musk make amends. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=597.12s)]
*  Saying, I feel like the kids of [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=599.0s)]
*  the Bidder Divorce, where you're [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=600.88s)]
*  just saying, I really wish mommy [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=603.32s)]
*  and daddy would stop screaming. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=605.64s)]
*  I'm sure that there's a lot of that [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=608.32s)]
*  going on in the Cruz household. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=610.8s)]
*  Anyway, I've seen how his daughter [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=613.28s)]
*  looks at him. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=615.16s)]
*  So that's where we're at with this [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=616.32s)]
*  ongoing feud. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=618.32s)]
*  It was entertaining, that's for [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=619.72s)]
*  sure, but ultimately, I think that [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=621.56s)]
*  it's probably in Trump's best [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=623.76s)]
*  interest to shed Elon Musk. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=625.64s)]
*  And again, Democrats shouldn't [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=627.52s)]
*  absorb him. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=630.0s)]
*  And I don't think he's even [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=630.76s)]
*  interested in being absorbed by [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=632.2s)]
*  the Democratic Party. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=634.0s)]
*  Want to know why? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=635.48s)]
*  Because he's not interested in any [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=636.28s)]
*  of the remaining good parts of [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=638.4s)]
*  the Democratic Party. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=640.4s)]
*  So he is a libertarian, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=643.08s)]
*  he wants deregulation, he thinks [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=644.68s)]
*  Social Security is a freaking [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=646.8s)]
*  Ponzi scheme. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=648.68s)]
*  I don't want anything to do with [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=649.72s)]
*  this guy, and the Democrats should [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=651.08s)]
*  want nothing to do with this guy. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=652.6s)]
*  They're already thought of as [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=653.92s)]
*  the pro-corporate party, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=655.44s)]
*  the party that abandoned [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=656.84s)]
*  the working class. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=658.2s)]
*  Corrobing Elon Musk is going to [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=659.3199999999999s)]
*  make that situation any better. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=660.74s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=662.56s)]
*  an angel gets a swings. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=664.16s)]
*  Totally not true, but it does keep [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=665.68s)]
*  you updated on our live shows. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd6CBvP6bA8&t=667.24s)]
