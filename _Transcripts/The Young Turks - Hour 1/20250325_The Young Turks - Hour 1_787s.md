"The Social Security Administration website crashed four times in 10 days thus far in March because the servers were overloaded, blocking millions of retirees and disabled Americans from logging in to their online accounts. In the field, office managers have resorted to answering phones in place of receptionists because so many employees have been pushed out."*

TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.

TYT‚Äôs 24/7 programming is available on YouTube TV, Samsung TV, Plus, Roku, Xumo, TCLtv+, Fubo, and more.

TYT is also available as a podcast on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, TuneIn, Amazon Music, and more.

# REPORT: Social Security Admin BREAKING DOWN After Trump's DOGE Attacks
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [March 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY)
*  Social Security is already falling [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=0.0s)]
*  apart and [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=2.2600000000000002s)]
*  Congress didn't even have to pass [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=2.92s)]
*  a bill to dismantle it. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=4.88s)]
*  Offices are shutting down and [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=6.58s)]
*  there are now astronomically long [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=8.42s)]
*  wait times for Social Security [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=10.5s)]
*  recipients who need their questions [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=12.3s)]
*  answered. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=14.5s)]
*  And it's all thanks to the efforts [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=15.72s)]
*  of Elon Musk and Doge according to [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=17.54s)]
*  a deeply concerning report that was [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=19.36s)]
*  just published by The Washington [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  Post. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=23.0s)]
*  So let's get into the details, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=23.54s)]
*  Cenk. What concerns you the most [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=24.8s)]
*  about all this? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=26.16s)]
*  The fact that they are going [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=27.26s)]
*  straight to the core of benefits [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=29.540000000000003s)]
*  that we all earned and [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=32.54s)]
*  put in our whole lives. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=34.5s)]
*  This is an attack against [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=37.02s)]
*  Social Security. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=39.02s)]
*  And it's actually a really insidious [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=40.78s)]
*  one because they're hiding the [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=43.7s)]
*  attack under efficiency when it's [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=46.2s)]
*  the exact opposite. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=48.900000000000006s)]
*  Let's give you the details about [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=50.74s)]
*  how they're going to attack [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=51.980000000000004s)]
*  Social Security. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=52.900000000000006s)]
*  So Leland Dudek, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=53.78s)]
*  whose name is real, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=55.220000000000006s)]
*  is the acting commissioner of [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=56.34s)]
*  the Social Security [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=57.940000000000005s)]
*  administration. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=58.900000000000006s)]
*  And he's even on the record [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=60.5s)]
*  admitting that Doge is running [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=62.540000000000006s)]
*  the show. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=64.9s)]
*  He stated that Doge people are [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=65.5s)]
*  learning and they will make [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=67.58s)]
*  mistakes, but we have to let them [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=69.58s)]
*  see what is going on at the Social [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=71.94s)]
*  Security administration. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=74.26s)]
*  I am relying on longtime career [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=76.06s)]
*  people to inform my work, but [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=77.9s)]
*  I am receiving decisions that are [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=79.7s)]
*  made without my input and [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=81.86s)]
*  I have to effectuate those [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=83.58000000000001s)]
*  decisions. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=85.30000000000001s)]
*  So look, to his credit, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=86.66000000000001s)]
*  Leland Dudek is noticing that [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=87.9s)]
*  things are breaking. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=89.5s)]
*  He is in a very subtle way in that [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=90.86000000000001s)]
*  statement admitting that Doge is [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=92.54s)]
*  breaking things and making mistakes [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=94.30000000000001s)]
*  over at the Social Security [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=96.06s)]
*  administration. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=97.34s)]
*  But I want to decode that for [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=98.22s)]
*  you a little further because it is [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=99.42s)]
*  not a mistake. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=100.98s)]
*  This is very much intentional. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=101.7s)]
*  The Trump administration knows that [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=103.98s)]
*  Social Security is the third rail. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=105.58000000000001s)]
*  They know that it is incredibly [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=107.14000000000001s)]
*  difficult to make cuts, to [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=109.02000000000001s)]
*  privatize, to change Social [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=110.66000000000001s)]
*  Security. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=112.42s)]
*  So people who paid into that [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=113.42s)]
*  system, people who are entitled to [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=114.78s)]
*  those benefits, get less of those [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=116.58s)]
*  benefits in return. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=118.38s)]
*  And so they're doing it in this [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=119.89999999999999s)]
*  roundabout way by having members of [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=121.42s)]
*  Doge go in and just fire people, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=123.22s)]
*  dismantle the program without any [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=124.82s)]
*  legislation having to pass at all. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=126.82s)]
*  So let's talk about those [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=129.26s)]
*  specifics. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=130.62s)]
*  For starters, the Social Security [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=131.54s)]
*  administration is attempting to [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=133.18s)]
*  reduce its workforce. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=134.74s)]
*  In fact, 7,000 Social Security [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=135.62s)]
*  administration workers received [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=137.57999999999998s)]
*  layoff notices. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=139.7s)]
*  And that means that they're going [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=141.17999999999998s)]
*  to get rid of quite a few people. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=143.57999999999998s)]
*  There's only 57,000 employees at [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=146.38s)]
*  the Social Security [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=148.66s)]
*  administration, which means that [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=150.05999999999997s)]
*  they're going to cut that workforce [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=152.33999999999997s)]
*  by 12%. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=154.42s)]
*  They've gone about this by offering [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=154.94s)]
*  buyouts and also expanding early [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=156.85999999999999s)]
*  retirement options for [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=158.61999999999998s)]
*  anyone who's not included in that [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=159.94s)]
*  list of 7,000 people who are told [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=161.85999999999999s)]
*  that they're getting fired. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=163.7s)]
*  Other positions have been [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=165.42s)]
*  eliminated altogether and [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=166.38s)]
*  those are the 7,000 people that [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=167.42s)]
*  I was referring to. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=168.85999999999999s)]
*  Now as a result of these changes, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=170.14s)]
*  entire offices, including those [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=172.26s)]
*  handling civil rights and [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=174.33999999999997s)]
*  modernization, were driven out. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=176.01999999999998s)]
*  The 10 regional offices that [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=178.17999999999998s)]
*  oversee field operations were [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=180.29999999999998s)]
*  slashed to four. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=182.51999999999998s)]
*  So you go from 10 offices to four [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=183.57999999999998s)]
*  offices. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=185.42s)]
*  Obviously, recipients are going to [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=185.94s)]
*  have a far harder time finding [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=188.29999999999998s)]
*  a live person to talk to if there [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=190.14s)]
*  has been some sort of issue with [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=192.04s)]
*  their payment. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=193.94s)]
*  They haven't gotten their Social [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=195.22s)]
*  Security check. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=196.7s)]
*  Now, the Social Security [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=197.54s)]
*  Administration has also announced [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=198.98s)]
*  that starting next Monday, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=201.22s)]
*  any transactions that require [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=202.94s)]
*  identity verification will no [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=204.94s)]
*  longer be allowed over the phone or [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=206.98s)]
*  online, you'd have to do that [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=209.18s)]

*  the week before. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=215.42s)]
*  The one area where there has been [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=216.46s)]

*  it tends to happen online, which is [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=232.5s)]

*  I'm totally fine with that, but [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=262.78s)]
*  you need to make that easy for [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=264.64s)]
*  the rightful recipients to be able [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=266.42s)]

*  They're just saying it. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=283.86s)]

*  And so that's a giant amount of [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=295.06s)]

*  most of the independents that voted [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=594.7s)]

*  actually smart in what to focus on [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=659.5s)]
*  as they campaign for [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=661.98s)]
*  the midterm elections. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=663.78s)]
*  That's a big if, so [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=665.54s)]

*  then that's not a prediction. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=670.66s)]
*  I would never count on the [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=672.18s)]
*  Democrats to do anything right. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=673.42s)]

*  800 billion that they're planning [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=679.2199999999999s)]

*  If you can't win on that, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=685.62s)]
*  every single elected official in [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=687.42s)]
*  Democratic Party should resign in [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=689.74s)]

*  the majority of his voters are [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=737.14s)]
*  going to think that way. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=738.58s)]
*  But a solid chunk of the people who [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=740.18s)]
*  voted for Trump are going to be [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=742.38s)]
*  just furious when they find out he [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=744.38s)]
*  screwed them too, because we got no [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=746.82s)]
*  hope left. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=749.5s)]
*  Nobody's got any hope left. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=751.02s)]
*  And when you pull that hope, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=752.6999999999999s)]
*  not from us, but from them, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=754.3s)]
*  they're going to be more angry than [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=755.98s)]
*  you could imagine. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=757.9399999999999s)]
*  That's my guess. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=759.38s)]
*  Let's see how it turns out. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=760.22s)]
*  This is an epic political disaster [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=761.42s)]
*  for the Republicans. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=763.02s)]
*  The only upside of this is that you [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=763.9399999999999s)]
*  won't have to worry too much of the [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=765.86s)]
*  last two years of the Trump term [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=767.8199999999999s)]
*  because they'll be so [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=769.66s)]
*  intensely unpopular. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=770.9399999999999s)]
*  On the other hand, when they are, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=772.8199999999999s)]
*  maybe that's when they stop [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=774.3s)]
*  following the court orders. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=775.46s)]
*  And then we might, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=776.62s)]
*  depending on how things go, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=777.42s)]
*  then we might have real trouble. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=778.62s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=780.3s)]
*  an angel gets his wings. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=781.98s)]
*  Totally not true, but [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=783.38s)]
*  it does keep you updated on [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=784.38s)]
*  our live shows. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBsxVsZFaY&t=785.7s)]
