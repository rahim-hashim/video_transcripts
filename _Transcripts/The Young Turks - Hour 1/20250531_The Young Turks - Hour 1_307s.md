# Sports Writer Shares Spicy Take On Caitlin Clark-Angel Reese DRAMA
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [May 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWak8wAL_GA)
*  Have you been covering this? I actually hate the story and I'm trying not to pay any attention to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWak8wAL_GA&t=0.0s)]
*  it because it's like, I don't know what to make of it. But the whole Caitlin Clark Angel Reese [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWak8wAL_GA&t=6.96s)]
*  thing that just seems to keep getting uglier and uglier. I don't cover the WNBA, but I got, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWak8wAL_GA&t=12.24s)]
*  I mean, I have some spicy takes on that. I think it's kind of a bit overblown, honestly. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWak8wAL_GA&t=18.16s)]
*  Okay, I'm hoping it is, but then something else comes out where I'm like, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWak8wAL_GA&t=23.28s)]
*  please, let's just stop doing this. I think it's funny. I think the sort of racial [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWak8wAL_GA&t=27.2s)]
*  tensions are good for drawing overall interest. I just think people in my industry, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWak8wAL_GA&t=33.36s)]
*  the protectionist nature of just like, when you do that, you're hurting the black woman. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWak8wAL_GA&t=40.24s)]
*  And it's like, guys, Angel Reese is fine, man. She's pretty freaking rich. She's pretty influential. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWak8wAL_GA&t=48.64s)]
*  She's a powerful person. She's gonna be fine. I'm not even talking physically. I'm talking about [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWak8wAL_GA&t=58.0s)]
*  she's a powerful woman. She's good. I think there's a certain level of pearl clutching [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWak8wAL_GA&t=64.64s)]
*  and protectionism that goes on in the industry that's racial in nature. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWak8wAL_GA&t=71.76s)]
*  That I'm just like, guys, I'm sorry, man. She's not part of a vulnerable population of black women. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWak8wAL_GA&t=76.08s)]
*  She's powerful, y'all. She's powerful. She got it going on. She's good. There are vulnerable [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWak8wAL_GA&t=83.52s)]
*  black women out there. Angel Reese ain't one of them, and we're not served by pretending that she [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWak8wAL_GA&t=90.32s)]
*  is. All right. But Caitlin Clark did push her, right? That was definitely, what is it called? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWak8wAL_GA&t=95.6s)]
*  A foul? She did a foul. Bitch, she fouled her. She did a foul. Throughout the course of it, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWak8wAL_GA&t=103.28s)]
*  especially the women's game, which is, to be honest, a very physical game. That foul does not [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWak8wAL_GA&t=113.36s)]
*  rate in that sport. That's a low level in terms of contact on that foul. These girls get nasty, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWak8wAL_GA&t=119.92s)]
*  okay? I'm talking about they will put blows on each other. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWak8wAL_GA&t=129.44s)]
*  What? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWak8wAL_GA&t=133.12s)]
*  Yeah, I'm serious. That Caitlin Clark- [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWak8wAL_GA&t=134.32s)]
*  You gotta watch the WNBA. That sounds fun. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWak8wAL_GA&t=136.0s)]
*  Clark hit was low level, I promise you. I mean, I saw it. It's just that I don't watch sports [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWak8wAL_GA&t=138.72s)]
*  often, and I definitely never watched the WNBA. So I watched the video and I was like, I mean, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWak8wAL_GA&t=146.24s)]
*  that was, yeah, she did the push. The push happened, but I don't know. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWak8wAL_GA&t=151.84s)]
*  It's a normal foul. I have to understand the context, right? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWak8wAL_GA&t=154.96s)]
*  In the context of that sport, in that league specifically, in the NBA, they're just not [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWak8wAL_GA&t=157.68s)]
*  as physical as the WNBA. They just- [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWak8wAL_GA&t=163.36s)]
*  Wow. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWak8wAL_GA&t=166.24s)]
*  These girls will literally, they tussle in that sport. That's what they do. And so to pretend [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWak8wAL_GA&t=166.32000000000002s)]
*  that little tiki-tack thing Caitlin Clark did, Angel Reese just was like, you know what? I don't [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWak8wAL_GA&t=173.76000000000002s)]
*  like what just happened. I'm gonna get spicy real quick, because Angel, she's obviously annoyed by [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWak8wAL_GA&t=178.96s)]
*  Caitlin Clark. She's annoyed by the- She is, yeah. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWak8wAL_GA&t=185.04000000000002s)]
*  It's obvious. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWak8wAL_GA&t=187.68s)]
*  And I can understand the annoyance, because look, I don't think that Caitlin Clark is getting all [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWak8wAL_GA&t=188.4s)]
*  this attention because she's white. I think she's getting all this attention because she's [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWak8wAL_GA&t=197.04000000000002s)]
*  talented, right? And when the WNBA- [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWak8wAL_GA&t=200.64000000000001s)]
*  Being white doesn't hurt. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWak8wAL_GA&t=203.36s)]
*  Yeah, sure. I mean, definitely because that race dynamic comes into play. But [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWak8wAL_GA&t=204.8s)]
*  I think the racial tension has been overblown by the media. And then when that happens, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWak8wAL_GA&t=210.0s)]
*  signals to the players. I feel like the players kind of feed into it a little bit, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWak8wAL_GA&t=217.28s)]
*  and I wish that didn't happen. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWak8wAL_GA&t=221.04s)]
*  I think there's three elements that matter in this. And the players had a lot of resentment [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWak8wAL_GA&t=221.92s)]
*  for Caitlin Clark when she came into the league. That's not made up. They kept her off of Team USA. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWak8wAL_GA&t=228.8s)]
*  They did all of the crazy hard files, all the crazy stuff they was doing her rookie year. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWak8wAL_GA&t=234.0s)]
*  They were not feeling her. And I don't think it's just a racial thing. I think one, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWak8wAL_GA&t=239.6s)]
*  the league is extremely woke, and Caitlin Clark has taken a lot of pains to be apolitical. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWak8wAL_GA&t=244.96s)]
*  Also, she's straight. That's another part. She's not gay. So she's not part of the dominant culture [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWak8wAL_GA&t=251.84s)]
*  and club in that league, okay? Out in society and culture, yes, she is. But in the context of the [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWak8wAL_GA&t=259.68s)]
*  WNBA, she ain't part of that. And so you add that to the great white hope feeling [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWak8wAL_GA&t=268.72s)]
*  to a predominantly black league, it's not hard to understand why people was annoyed by her. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWak8wAL_GA&t=276.0s)]
*  You ain't woke, you ain't gay, and you ain't black. Get out of here. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWak8wAL_GA&t=281.12s)]
*  You know what? This is why they pay you the big bucks, Was, because that's the kind of context [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWak8wAL_GA&t=284.40000000000003s)]
*  and the details that I'm not reading anywhere else, I'm not hearing anywhere else. And yeah, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWak8wAL_GA&t=288.88000000000005s)]
*  thank you for keeping it real. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWak8wAL_GA&t=294.32000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, we will talk about that off camera sometime. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWak8wAL_GA&t=296.16s)]
*  Yeah. All right, sounds good. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWak8wAL_GA&t=298.48s)]
