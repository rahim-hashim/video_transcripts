According to a statement issued by the broadcaster, BBC Arabic correspondent Feras Kilani, a British citizen, along with two BBC colleagues and four Syrian freelancers, were held for seven hours on May 9 while filming in southern Syria near Golan Heights."

# Israeli Soldiers Reportedly Strip-Searched, Interrogated BBC Journalists At Gunpoint
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg)
*  According to a statement issued by the broadcaster, BBC Arabic correspondent Faris [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=0.0s)]
*  Killani, a British citizen, along with two BBC colleagues and four Syrian freelancers, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=6.16s)]
*  were held for seven hours on May 9th while filming in southern Syria near Golan Heights. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=12.16s)]
*  The team have described how they were tied up, blindfolded, strip searched, interrogated and [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=18.96s)]
*  threatened, the BBC said, adding that soldiers also confiscated and deleted material from their [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=25.36s)]
*  devices despite making clear to the soldiers on multiple occasions that they were working for the [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=31.2s)]
*  BBC. The behavior they were subjected to is wholly unacceptable. The IDF soldiers reportedly [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=37.36s)]
*  pointed their rifles at the heads of the reporters and confiscated their phones and cameras. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=44.96s)]
*  One officer speaking fluent Palestinian Arabic told Killani he would be treated differently from [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=51.52s)]
*  the rest of the crew but still demanded he stripped to his underwear under threat. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=57.36s)]
*  He was interrogated about personal details, including his children, while the rest of his [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=61.760000000000005s)]
*  team was bound, blindfolded and subjected to the same process. And listen to the chilling threat [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=66.8s)]
*  they were given by the IDF. The officer threatened us with worse consequences if we approached [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=74.48s)]
*  the frontier from the Syrian side again and said that they know everything about us and would [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=81.2s)]
*  track us down if any hidden or undeleted photo was ever published. As of now, the IDF has yet [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=87.60000000000001s)]
*  to comment on the situation. But Cenk, what do you make of this? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=96.16s)]
*  Yeah, so this is a twofer. Israel has done this very regularly recently. So one is [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=100.0s)]
*  targeting journalists because they don't want word getting out about all the horrific war crimes and [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=109.36s)]
*  ethnic cleansing and genocide that they're doing. I'm glad that they're slightly embarrassed about [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=117.28s)]
*  it but their way of going about it is to either humiliate and detain and steal the work product [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=122.64s)]
*  of journalists or just simply to murder them. A little bit later, we're gonna have stats for [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=131.68s)]
*  you guys on how they have killed more journalists than conflicts that were way larger. I mean, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=136.88s)]
*  you're gonna be shocked at those numbers. And it's not just in killing the journalists and [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=145.36s)]
*  detaining the journalists. They're trying to shut down any social media. They're trying to shut down [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=151.04s)]
*  any person in media who speaks against Israel. They're trying to shut down anyone on a college [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=155.76s)]
*  campus who speaks against Israel. I mean, Israel is doing the biggest cancel culture project that [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=160.23999999999998s)]
*  anyone has ever seen. So this is them trying to cancel all foreign press and trying to send a [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=168.39999999999998s)]
*  message to them saying, you better not try to tell people the truth about Israel. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=174.07999999999998s)]
*  If you don't lie on our behalf and you dare try to do actual reporting, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=180.08s)]
*  there's gonna be significant consequences for you. And then the second part is the humiliation. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=184.72s)]
*  They love to do this and it's a lot of what tormentors do. I feel like Israel has become [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=189.68s)]
*  one giant Stanford prison experiment where they've become the guards and they've taken on that role. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=195.92000000000002s)]
*  And so they've become like gratuitously disgustingly [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=202.96s)]
*  torturous. And so they're just going in and going, what else can we do? Yeah, let's strip [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=207.2s)]
*  them down and we'll march them around in their underwear. That'll show the Palestinians and [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=212.39999999999998s)]
*  the stupid journalists covering the Palestinians. Jesus Christ, what happened to Israel? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=217.2s)]
*  This is unbelievable. And so look, it's one thing if you hate Israel, it's another thing [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=222.39999999999998s)]
*  if you're neutral. But if you love Israel, this is what you wanted Israel to be? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=226.79999999999998s)]
*  This was your dream? God, I hope that's not the case, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=230.8s)]
*  because it's turned into something monstrous in this ridiculous effort to so-called [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=235.92000000000002s)]
*  protect themselves, right? Notice where the story is in. It's not in Israel, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=243.52s)]
*  it's not even in the occupied territories. This is in Syria. What the hell are they doing in Syria? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=250.48000000000002s)]
*  Well, they're doing greater Israel. Because I mean, look, I don't know, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=257.36s)]
*  if you're an Israeli supporter, did you know the plan was always greater Israel? Do you love [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=261.12s)]
*  that it's greater Israel and then you keep going into Arab land and taking it and pretending it's [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=268.08s)]
*  for self-defense and then slaughtering the people inside and treating them as hostages and prisoners [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=273.76s)]
*  for 58 years? Was that the goal? Was that what you dreamt about with Israel, that you always [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=278.64s)]
*  wanted to take more and more Arab land while pretending to do self-defense? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=284.88s)]
*  Or did you really actually want a peaceful Israel? Because if you wanted Israel that [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=289.36s)]
*  was lived in peace with its neighbors, you're going in the exact wrong direction. And if you [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=294.40000000000003s)]
*  wanted it to be a safe haven for Jews, how does it help to get the entire world to despise Israel [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=301.36s)]
*  by doing things like this? How does that help? So I don't know. If you love Israel, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=307.92s)]
*  you should be 10,000 times more disgusted by this story than we are. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=313.12s)]
*  And you should take action to get Israel to turn around. But if this is what you like, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=318.08000000000004s)]
*  then you become a monster too. All right, we're gonna give you more evidence in a sec. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=323.92s)]
*  But yeah, I think that regardless of what Israel or anybody who supports Israel's [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=329.52000000000004s)]
*  government's goal was, what we're looking at is just a complete lack of boundaries and a [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=335.92s)]
*  lack of consequences for anything that they've ever done. Because the first issue was Israel [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=340.88s)]
*  being founded in land that was already occupied. So that in and of itself created the issue that's [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=345.2s)]
*  still been going on. But I mean, ever since Israel's founding, America has been firmly behind [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=350.15999999999997s)]
*  their government. So I mean, this is one of the issues that Democrats and Republicans are [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=355.52s)]
*  practically identical on in terms of the handling of the Israeli state. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=360.15999999999997s)]
*  Doesn't matter what they do, they get the weapons that they request when they request them. They [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=363.44s)]
*  get upgrades when they request them. And despite the world's lack of enthusiasm for what's happening [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=368.24s)]
*  to the Palestinian people, what difference does it make if the powers that be don't do anything [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=375.68s)]
*  about it? So even if we get a real progressive to be president, which that's a huge uphill battle, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=380.96000000000004s)]
*  it's easier to get progressives in like house seats and stuff like that. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=387.28000000000003s)]
*  Nothing's impossible. But even if we did do that, I mean, sure, maybe we could get a little bit of [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=391.2s)]
*  leeway, but what would really change because that APAC money and just Israeli influence over [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=396.32s)]
*  them being one of our top allies, is one person really going to be able to change that? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=403.68s)]
*  So unfortunately, I think this is an issue that may never change that much unless everybody, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=409.6s)]
*  not just Americans, but the whole world stands up to the leaders in their government and demand [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=416.56s)]
*  change. Otherwise, it's just too ingrained in the system. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=423.12s)]
*  We've got some of the stats that show that this isn't just them humiliating journalists [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=425.76s)]
*  intermittently or this isn't an anomaly. They're also killing them in record numbers. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=432.64s)]
*  And a report published in early April found that Israel's war on Gaza has killed 232 journalists, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=438.72s)]
*  an average of 13 per month, making it the deadliest conflict for media workers [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=445.12s)]
*  ever recorded, according to a report by the Watson Institute for International and Public [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=450.47999999999996s)]
*  Affairs Costs of Wars Project. More journalists have been killed in Gaza than in both world wars, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=456.23999999999995s)]
*  the Vietnam War, the wars in Yugoslavia, and the United States War in Afghanistan combined. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=462.96s)]
*  I mean, Cenk, how do you feel when you hear those numbers, when you hear that stat and all of these [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=471.03999999999996s)]
*  wars combined, it is horrific. I literally told that to somebody that's at the ACLU at a University [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=476.88s)]
*  of Chicago panel that we did together. And she was on the left with me, we were defending [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=484.71999999999997s)]
*  freedom of speech. And so I brought it up in the context of freedom of speech. And she said, no, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=491.52s)]
*  no, no, no, there's no way that that's true. Now, why does she say that? One is, of course, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=495.84s)]
*  bias. Beloved Israel can do no wrong, even though they've slaughtered more journalists. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=500.96s)]
*  Yes, slaughtered. Whenever it's Palestinians, the New York Times says slaughtered. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=505.76s)]
*  When Palestinians doing it, whenever it's Palestinians getting slaughtered, they say, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=509.68s)]
*  killed, statistic number, right? No, they're human beings, those are journalists. By the way, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=513.76s)]
*  if you're at the New York Times and you're at other mainstream media outlets, I mean, those should be [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=518.72s)]
*  considered your colleagues. Obviously, they're not your colleagues, cuz you're not real reporters. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=524.0s)]
*  So, and that leads me to another point, which is that our media, our so-called reporters, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=528.3199999999999s)]
*  are the worst in the world, in the world. Okay, why do I say that? So how many times have you [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=533.6s)]
*  heard that amazing journalist number? The number of journalists killed, more than World War I, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=540.4s)]
*  World War II, Vietnam, etc., all that combined. How many times, outside of the Young Turks, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=545.2s)]
*  my guess is that you've never heard it. Why aren't other journalists in America outraged by that? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=549.6s)]
*  I mean, my God, when there's journalists killed in other conflicts, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=557.2s)]
*  rightfully so, they're like, this is outrageous, right? When Khashoggi was chopped up, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=560.4s)]
*  Washington Post columnist by the Saudis, we all went nuts over it. We all still remember it, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=566.4s)]
*  and that's good, that's good. So that's one journalist that the Saudis killed, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=570.88s)]
*  and we spent years talking about it. Over 200 journalists murdered by Israel. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=575.52s)]
*  Shh. And to Jackson's point, really, every reporter in the country didn't notice [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=581.9200000000001s)]
*  that the AIPAC money might be influencing our congresspeople. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=591.28s)]
*  Do you know that 87% of the people in Congress take money from AIPAC and affiliated groups? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=594.96s)]
*  And what an amazing coincidence. Every single one of them votes to give Israel endless money, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=600.72s)]
*  no matter what they do. But yet, not a single mainstream media reporter in this country [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=609.84s)]
*  noticed that? Come on, you guys are a joke, a total and utter joke. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=616.5600000000001s)]
*  You didn't notice either one of those amazing facts. No, no, golly gee, it's Israel, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=623.9200000000001s)]
*  I just couldn't see it. Okay, so, but the good news is, now online media, social media is strong [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=629.9200000000001s)]
*  enough that people are all waking up from this matrix and going, what? AIPAC's the number one [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=635.92s)]
*  donor to people in Congress, and these loser marketing executives at New York Times and CNN, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=643.52s)]
*  and that's what they are, they're not reporters. They're just marketing executives or donors. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=650.7199999999999s)]
*  They didn't notice that the largest donor and the fact that we have given over $300 billion to [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=655.04s)]
*  Israel to steal more land, to kill more Arabs, to kill more journalists, they just couldn't, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=661.92s)]
*  they didn't notice. They didn't, golly geez, that's what's happening? We didn't notice. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=667.04s)]
*  And let alone the propaganda about how they're the most moral army and the Palestinians had it [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=672.64s)]
*  coming, because they use human shields, by the way. That human shields line is literally the [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=676.4799999999999s)]
*  defense of every single government that has ever committed a genocide. They always say, well, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=681.5999999999999s)]
*  Armenians are hiding behind their own civilians. We had no choice but to slaughter them all. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=688.24s)]
*  Well, the Jews were hiding behind their own civilians, and the Croats and the Bosnians [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=692.48s)]
*  were hiding behind their own civilians, so we had to kill them all, you see? And why we did it? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=698.08s)]
*  Self-defense, self-defense. But our reporters in America haven't figured it out. Reporters all [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=703.2s)]
*  across the world, governments across the world, start rebelling against Israel. Why do you work [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=709.36s)]
*  for them? Tell me, I get why our scumbag politicians work for them. They literally get [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=715.36s)]
*  bribed. I know it's legal bribes, but it's obviously bribes. But reporters, why do you work for them? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=720.16s)]
*  And aren't you just embarrassed? So they humiliate these poor BBC reporters, strip them down their [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=726.72s)]
*  underwear, do all this stuff, right? But in a sense, aren't they doing that to everyone on cable news [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=732.48s)]
*  in America? I mean, they have to go out there and do this humiliating reports like, Israel is the [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=737.12s)]
*  most moral army. The Palestinians had it coming. They deserve it. They're the terrorists. Not Israel, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=742.88s)]
*  not Israel. Israel has killed over 500 times the number of children that Hamas killed. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=749.4399999999999s)]
*  And our dumb ass humiliated reporters go out there and go, no, Hamas and Palestinians are the savage [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=756.24s)]
*  terrorists. Israel, no way. Accidentally, they accidentally murdered 16,000 kids. They accidentally [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=764.88s)]
*  murdered 30,000 women and children. It was all an accident. They didn't mean it. They're the best. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=771.36s)]
*  Humiliating. Well, I think also not just the biggest issue, obviously, is the money and how [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=776.56s)]
*  long it's been involved. But also, this kind of reminds me of how the public and reporters and [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=783.8399999999999s)]
*  things like that have become very desensitized to issues like gun violence in America. It's so [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=791.8399999999999s)]
*  permeated in our daily news cycle. It's so much a part of what we expect that you just kind of look [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=797.6s)]
*  the other way. And unfortunately, I think that that's what a lot of the public feels. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=804.4s)]
*  For people who aren't very strong supporters of Palestinian rights, it's just kind of like, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=811.52s)]
*  well, there's another day, another thing that Israel's doing. So it's just ingrained in how [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=815.84s)]
*  we do what we do. It's just heartbreaking. It's absolutely heartbreaking. This is totally [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=822.72s)]
*  preventable. There's no need for it. And I think there's a lot of blood on the hands of [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=826.64s)]
*  international agencies and especially US politicians who enable it and block any [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=832.16s)]
*  attempt to hold this government and their military accountable because that's why this continues. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=836.56s)]
*  If there were any repercussions for this at one death, at two deaths, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=841.76s)]
*  it wouldn't happen. And it wouldn't be the numbers that we're seeing more than all of [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=846.48s)]
*  these wars combined. Yeah, our governments are all giant sellouts. They don't represent [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=850.24s)]
*  us at all. Do you think the British government represents the British people? [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=856.24s)]
*  Do you think they're enraged by what happened to BBC? No, they're gonna lie down and take it again. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=859.52s)]
*  They're gonna make excuses for Israel. They're gonna send them more money, more weapons, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=864.16s)]
*  kill more Palestinians, humiliate our journalists even more. And they're nothing compared to America. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=868.08s)]
*  I'm sick of Israeli control. And if you're saying that Israel doesn't control our politicians, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=873.52s)]
*  you're a moron or deeply, deeply biased and you live in an alternate reality, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=880.0s)]
*  a crazy la la land where facts are upside down. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4HNPqVaKMg&t=886.88s)]
