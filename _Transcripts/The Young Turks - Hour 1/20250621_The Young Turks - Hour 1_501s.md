"WASHINGTON, June 20 (Reuters) - Republican provisions to slash funding for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other financial watchdogs violate budgetary rules, the U.S. Senate's nonpartisan referee said on Friday, jeopardizing their inclusion in a sweeping tax-cut and spending bill pushed by President Donald Trump."

# Big, Beautiful Bill Dealt A MASSIVE BLOW
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU)
*  The Senate parliamentarian, remember her? She just dealt a massive blow to Trump's big, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=0.0s)]
*  beautiful bill. If Republicans listen to her, it could be a surprising bit of good news for [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=7.36s)]
*  key government agencies, but Cenk, will they? Yeah, I don't know. I'm so curious about this, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  cuz the Democrats said that the parliamentarian was the most powerful force in the universe. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=20.56s)]
*  And if she said that they could not do something, well, then they couldn't do it forever and ever [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=25.36s)]
*  So I'm actually even surprised that the word parliamentarian is even being used [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=30.48s)]
*  during Trump administration here, cuz usually when Republicans are in charge, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=36.08s)]
*  we never hear the parliamentarian again. So no, I don't know what's going to happen, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=40.0s)]
*  but I would be surprised if the Republicans gave a damn. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=44.24s)]
*  Yeah, let's get into the specifics. Senate parliamentarian Elizabeth McDonough has [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  ruled that several key pieces of the massive bill to implement President Trump's agenda [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=52.8s)]
*  run afoul of the bird rule and must be taken out of the package to allow it to pass with [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=57.76s)]
*  the simple majority vote on a special procedural fast track. These included a provision that would [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=62.879999999999995s)]
*  have placed a funding cap on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which would have [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=69.6s)]
*  cut 6.4 billion from the agency by reducing its maximum funding to 0% of the Federal Reserve's [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=73.75999999999999s)]
*  operating expenses. She also ruled against language cutting 1.4 billion in costs by reducing [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=81.92s)]
*  the pay of Federal Reserve staff, cutting 293 million by reducing the Office of Financial [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=87.36s)]
*  Research Funding and cutting 771 million by eliminating the public company accounting [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=94.0s)]
*  oversight board. Republicans are trying to pass the big, beautiful bill through a process called [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=100.88s)]
*  reconciliation, which imposes strict limits on what can be inside the bill, but allows for passage [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=107.12s)]
*  with a simple majority. If Republicans wanna keep these cuts, they would need 60 votes in the [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=112.8s)]
*  Senate, which they ultimately, they certainly would not get because they only have 53 seats. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=118.32s)]
*  From here becomes a question of whether or not they will listen to the parliamentarian. There are [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=123.6s)]
*  safeguards in place like requiring 60 votes to override her, but that is if Republicans listen [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=129.12s)]
*  to her, oblige, follow these rules. And Cenk, there are serious anti-democratic consequences [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=136.64s)]
*  if either party, whether we like it or not, if either party were to simply ignore her. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=144.48s)]
*  What do you make of this? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=150.32s)]
*  Well, okay, so if the Republicans ignore her, then I don't ever, ever wanna hear another Democrat [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=151.11999999999998s)]
*  tell me about the parliamentarian, okay? So they've used this parliamentarian as an excuse not to do [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=158.23999999999998s)]
*  their agenda the entire time that I've been covering politics. The Byrd rule, this rule, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=163.36s)]
*  the filibuster, this, that. So if the Republicans go, yeah, I don't care about the parliamentarian, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=168.88000000000002s)]
*  they just go forward, that's it. I'm done with the parliamentarian forever and ever. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=173.44000000000003s)]
*  And anyone who tells you about the parliamentarian is a giant, giant liar who doesn't actually wanna [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=176.96s)]
*  do their agenda. I think that that's probably the case already, but this will certainly determine it, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=181.52s)]
*  right? And to be fair, if the Republicans do listen to the parliamentarian and preserve the [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=186.24s)]
*  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, I'll be very surprised and go, okay, well, at least then it's [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=191.44s)]
*  even handed and that makes me feel a lot better about it. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=197.68s)]
*  I still don't believe that the filibuster should exist. I'm principled and I'm not gonna change my [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=200.72s)]
*  views on it, depending on who's in charge. I think the majority should get the rule. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=205.84s)]
*  And that's why you shouldn't vote for Republicans, cuz they try to do things like destroy the [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=210.07999999999998s)]
*  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. In case you don't know, for every dollar we spend in that [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=213.2s)]
*  bureau, we get back $20. So by trying to destroy this bureau, they would cost us a lot of money [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=218.88s)]
*  and we would go further into debt. And by the way, what money does the Consumer [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=228.56s)]
*  Financial Protection Bureau bring us back? Money that bankers stole from American citizens. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=233.28s)]
*  And they're not gonna return that money with their army of lawyers if they weren't caught [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=240.32s)]
*  red handed and actually did steal it. And so they have gotten a lot of money back for the [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=244.56s)]
*  American people. It's one of the best things in government. So of course, the deeply corrupt [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=249.36s)]
*  Republican politicians all wanna get rid of it because they work for the rich, they work for [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=254.88s)]
*  corporations, they work for bankers. And that's why they're constantly attacking anything that [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=260.0s)]
*  helps protect the average American. Sharon. I think they're gonna listen only because it serves [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=265.12s)]
*  their own interests. Some of those fiscal hawks who are against still the bill and don't wanna fight [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=273.52000000000004s)]
*  Trump directly on it, don't wanna be calling it out or go to the mat, I guess. And I think that [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=278.32s)]
*  that could work. Convenient when she's convenient, and then they'll override her when they feel like [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=285.76s)]
*  it again in the future. But I really think this is an opportunity for some who really still aren't [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=292.64s)]
*  sold on this. Yeah, I go back and forth on whether or not, I guess for me, Democrats should ignore [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=297.2s)]
*  the parliamentarian. And the warning is always, well, you set this up, Republicans are going to [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=306.08s)]
*  exploit it as well. And you look at some of the cuts that are on the table right now that they're [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=311.28s)]
*  trying to put into this bill, this birdbath. So it's called the process of looking into what [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=315.76s)]
*  the provisions are specifically and making that determination whether they can stay. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=320.96s)]
*  Thankfully pulled out right now, like you're saying, Cenk, an effort to strip the Consumer [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=325.76s)]
*  Financial Protection Bureau of its funding. That said, they're still gonna try to do that in other [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=333.2s)]
*  ways. They've already gutted it. They're already trying to go after its funding and other avenues. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=338.88s)]
*  So it feels like some of these other things they've tried to work in don't belong in there. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=342.88s)]
*  Of course, you have all these other provisions like trying to prevent states from regulating AI [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=347.04s)]
*  for 10 years. None of this has anything to do with the budget or the deficit. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=351.92s)]
*  All these things that they've tried to, all this pork they've tried to push in. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=356.40000000000003s)]
*  It's moments like this where I kind of go, I flip and I'm like, I am kind of glad that's in there. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=360.16s)]
*  That said, I don't know if they're going to listen. I don't have a lot of hope. I will be [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=365.12s)]
*  surprised if they listen to her. And they could just simply ignore the process here. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=370.0s)]
*  It would require 60 votes to override or ignore her warning. That is if they follow the process. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=375.84s)]
*  So who knows? If they pass it and try to implement it, we could see if that challenge, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=382.8s)]
*  this bird rule makes its way to the Supreme Court or something that is [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=388.08s)]
*  law and there's precedent here. It's going to be confusing and messy. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=391.52s)]
*  And I do think we shouldn't discount the anti-democratic consequences for either party [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=396.0s)]
*  to do that. Yeah, so the Republican voters often talk about how Democrats are two pro-establishment. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=401.6s)]
*  And I agree, they are two pro-establishment and I say that all the time. How about the [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=410.40000000000003s)]
*  Republican politicians? Because Republican politicians love the establishment. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=414.72s)]
*  They love bankers. They love it when bankers rob you blind. And then they go, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=420.88s)]
*  we don't want you to give that money back to the American citizens. We want a little big piece of [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=427.36s)]
*  the action, baby. Give me a little bit of campaign contribution. So, MAGA and all those guys, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=431.2s)]
*  you're calling out your totally, utterly corrupt pig politicians who are feeding at the trough of [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=437.2s)]
*  those bankers who are robbing average Americans in the middle of Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=444.32s)]
*  everywhere else. Or, yeah, I bought into propaganda about all regulations are bad. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=449.59999999999997s)]
*  You know what regulation is? It's another word for law. So you keep saying all laws are bad. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=455.52s)]
*  We shouldn't have any laws? They're not going to listen to laws anyway, so we should have laws [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=461.91999999999996s)]
*  against murder, rape, etc. What a weird extreme position. No, we should have laws to protect the [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=466.0s)]
*  average American. And the deeply corrupt Republican politicians are constantly trying to take that out [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=471.52s)]
*  on behalf of their banker donors who own them completely. And this is a perfect example of it. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=478.56s)]
*  They don't care about the budget. They drive up the deficit. They don't care about anything [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=486.32s)]
*  but serving the donor class. Every time you ring the bell below, an angel gets a swings. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=492.08s)]
*  Totally not true, but it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBVJ98ecCXU&t=497.36s)]
