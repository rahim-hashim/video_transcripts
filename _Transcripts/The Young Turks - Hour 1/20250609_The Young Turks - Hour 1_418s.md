In an interview on ABC‚Äôs This Week Sunday, Karl pressed Johnson to address why the files have not been made public despite some Republicans in the House clamoring for their release."*

# They Got Confronted With The Epstein Files Post
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q)
*  Do you know what he's talking about with the Epstein files? I mean, what is, and why haven't [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=0.0s)]
*  those files been released? Have you? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=7.16s)]
*  I mean, some of your members have said they gotta be released. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=9.16s)]
*  As Cash said in the vignette earlier, he's FBI. That's not my lane, I don't know. I can [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=12.76s)]
*  tell you that I don't think we have no concern about President Trump or his involvement or [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=17.6s)]
*  any of that. I think it's nonsense. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=21.76s)]
*  Thanks to Elon Musk's explosive post on X accusing President Donald Trump of being in [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=25.4s)]
*  the Epstein files, thus indirectly accusing him of being a pedophile. Trump's defenders [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=31.4s)]
*  are now being forced to essentially answer whether or not they think Musk was correct [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=36.48s)]
*  if he has a point, if there's something to be suspicious about. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=42.72s)]
*  So you just saw how speaker Mike Johnson nervously answered that question. Watching him squirm [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=45.72s)]
*  is always fun. But ironically, both FBI Director Cash Patel and Vice President JD Vance were [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=50.88s)]
*  confronted about Musk's post when the news broke while recording podcasts with Joe Rogan [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=57.92s)]
*  and Theo Vonn respectively. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=63.760000000000005s)]
*  And I wanna show you those clips. Take a look. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=65.2s)]
*  Time to drop the really big bomb. Donald Trump is in the Epstein files. That's the real reason [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=68.16s)]
*  they have not been made public. Have a nice day. Jesus Christ. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=73.06s)]
*  I'm not participating in any of that conversation between Elon and Joe. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=77.0s)]
*  Have a nice day, DJ. So much diggits falling away. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=80.72s)]
*  They're going back and forth about different things. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=83.6s)]
*  Does he know that Donald Trump is in the Epstein files? Or does he have access to the Epstein [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=85.76s)]
*  files? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=89.36s)]
*  I don't know how he would, but I'm just staying out of the Trump-Elon thing that's way outside [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=90.36s)]
*  of my- [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=94.32000000000001s)]
*  What the f*** are they doing? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=95.32000000000001s)]
*  I know my lane and that ain't it. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=96.32000000000001s)]
*  Wow. Elon Musk, time to drop the really big bomb, right? And I thought this was gonna [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=98.36s)]
*  be on Iran. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=103.6s)]
*  I haven't even seen, right? I haven't even seen this one. First of all, absolutely not. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=104.6s)]
*  Donald Trump didn't do anything wrong with Jeffrey Epstein. The guy is, whatever the [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=110.64s)]
*  Democrats and the media says about him, that's totally BS. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=116.94s)]
*  Totally BS, which is why the Trump administration should have no problem releasing the Epstein [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=122.11999999999999s)]
*  files. But for whatever reason, and even though that was promised by Donald Trump, by his [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=126.39999999999999s)]
*  campaign in the lead up to the 24 presidential election, we're not getting the Epstein files. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=131.12s)]
*  And one should ask why that is. What do you think, Waz? Why do you think they're not releasing [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=137.6s)]
*  it? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=142.8s)]
*  I honestly don't think it's Trump is on camera with 13-year-olds. I think it's an Israel [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=143.88s)]
*  thing. I think this guy was an Israeli agent. He was compiling dirt on American elites on [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=149.8s)]
*  behalf of the Israeli government. And because those are our boys, and it would make them [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=155.58s)]
*  look crazy for the public to know that our quote unquote ally is compiling compromising [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=160.28s)]
*  information, doing effed up stuff, compiling compromising information on our elites. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=167.72s)]
*  And for what? They're supposed to be our allies. Why are they doing that to our people? That's [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=175.95999999999998s)]
*  it. That's my guess. It's the Israelis. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=180.83999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, there are no good actors. If that theory ends up being true, and I am sympathetic [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=184.28s)]
*  to that theory, it makes a lot of people look bad. Because if that was a blackmail operation, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=191.64000000000001s)]
*  well, I mean, that means that there was some information to blackmail American politicians [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=197.72s)]
*  with. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=204.64000000000001s)]
*  And politicians and rich people, like this Jeff Wexler dude and all of these extremely [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=205.64s)]
*  powerful rich people. And it's not to say that people gotta understand how the intelligence [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=214.44s)]
*  works. It's not like they compile it and be like, all right, it's time to shake you down. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=222.79999999999998s)]
*  It's like when they need something from you, and you're like, no, I'm good, go piss off [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=227.2s)]
*  Israel. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=231.39999999999998s)]
*  You might wanna reconsider that. That's how that works. And again, it makes the elites [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=233.28s)]
*  look bad that they participated in bad behavior, particularly sexually. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=239.28s)]
*  And then it's like Israel, what are you doing? With friends like Israel, who needs enemies [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=243.84s)]
*  at this point? And that's an open question. And it is like, is our government just not [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=251.04000000000002s)]
*  gonna retaliate against these people for doing this to our guys, our citizens? That's what [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=257.03999999999996s)]
*  I think is the hold up here. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=263.52s)]
*  Now, look, I think you're right about that, to be honest. Anyway, it sucks. This is the [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=266.0s)]
*  reason why we're never gonna see the Epstein files. And by the way, I mean, based on the [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=273.59999999999997s)]
*  various people and politicians who ran with Jeffrey Epstein, members of both parties are [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=279.2s)]
*  incriminated or implicated. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=286.32s)]
*  And so it doesn't matter if it's a Democratic administration in charge or a Republican [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=288.72s)]
*  administration in charge. We're not gonna see those Epstein files. The final thing I'll say [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=293.04s)]
*  about that though is, I agree. I don't think that Israel has dirt on Trump, at least not [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=296.24s)]
*  the kind of dirt that we're talking about here. And the reason why I know that is because there [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=304.88s)]
*  have been some instances where Trump was willing to go against what Israel wanted. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=309.28s)]
*  So making a deal with Hamas in order to free one of the dual American-Israeli citizens [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=313.68s)]
*  from Gaza, that really upset Israel, but Trump did it anyway. Ending the war with the Houthis, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=320.8s)]
*  that upset Netanyahu. Trump did it anyway. Refusing- [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=327.92s)]
*  The new regime in Syria, the Israelis are not too keen on these ex-Al-Qaeda guys. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=331.28000000000003s)]
*  And the Trump administration took them off the terrorist watch list. It's just like, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=337.84000000000003s)]
*  yeah, whatever. We're fine with the Middle Easterners, police in the Middle East. Let [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=342.24s)]
*  the Saudis and the Turks figure it out and we're just gonna move on with our lives. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=347.52000000000004s)]
*  And the final thing, at least so far, we'll see if it holds and I hope it does. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=352.15999999999997s)]
*  He hasn't invaded Iran, he hasn't bombed Iran's nuclear fields. So that's something that [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=358.56s)]
*  Netanyahu and the Israeli government really, really wants the United States to do on their [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=365.59999999999997s)]
*  behalf, of course. And Trump seems unwilling to do it and wants to strike some sort of deal [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=369.52s)]
*  with Iran to prevent them from developing nuclear weapons. Hopefully, it continues going in that [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=375.2s)]
*  diplomatic direction. But I give you all of this not to rah rah cheerily Donald Trump, but to say, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=381.04s)]
*  someone who knows the Israeli government has some pretty gross dirt on him and will use it as [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=388.48s)]
*  blackmail, isn't gonna go against Israel the way that Trump has in these very narrow [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=394.24s)]
*  areas that I described. So- But he was definitely boys with [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=399.20000000000005s)]
*  Jeffrey Epstein- He was. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=402.72s)]
*  Which makes him just like Bill Clinton and a lot of these other crazy rich people. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=403.6s)]
*  Yep, that is true. That is true. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnTZ4RzO8Q&t=408.48s)]
