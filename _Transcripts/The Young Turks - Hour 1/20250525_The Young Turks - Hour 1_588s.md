"Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was shouting at Elon Musk in the halls of the West Wing last month, loud enough for Donald Trump to hear and in a language that he could certainly understand. Bessent and Musk were fighting over which of them should choose the next IRS leader‚Äîand, implicitly, over Musk‚Äôs bureaucracy-be-damned crusade. Without securing the Treasury chief‚Äôs sign-off, Musk had pushed through his own pick for the job. Bessent was, quite obviously, not having it.‚Äù

# THIS Is When MAGA Decided To Kick Elon Out
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [May 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y)
*  An explosive new report by The Atlantic has revealed that Elon Musk's time in the Trump [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=0.0s)]
*  administration was real messy, real, real messy, more messier than we thought. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=6.48s)]
*  So here's the most dramatic example. In April, Elon Musk and Treasury Secretary Scott Besant [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=12.32s)]
*  were feuding over who would get to pick the head of the IRS, the person to lead the IRS. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=20.16s)]
*  That led to a fight in the West Wing in which Besant reportedly yelled at Musk, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=26.4s)]
*  yelled the following at Musk saying, I can't say it, but he said the whole word, F you, F you, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=32.72s)]
*  F you, which is kind of unbelievable because if you've seen a single interview of Scott Besant, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=39.36s)]
*  he's like the calmest, most monotone guy on the planet. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=44.400000000000006s)]
*  But apparently, Musk set him off and he started screaming at him. Musk accused Besant of having [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  run two failed hedge funds, quote, I can't hear you, he told Besant, as they argued, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=55.36s)]
*  their faces just inches apart, say it louder. The exchange was symbolic of Musk's time in [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=62.0s)]
*  the White House. He wanted to move fast and break things without answering to anyone, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=68.32s)]
*  the Atlantic writes. Rather than taking the time to navigate and understand the quirks and nuances [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=73.44s)]
*  of the federal government, Musk instead told his team to move fast. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=80.0s)]
*  It would be better to backtrack later if necessary than to proceed with caution. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=84.64s)]
*  I mean, we're just talking about government programs that impact people's lives. But let's [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=90.56s)]
*  just break it and then if we need to fix it, we'll fix it later. I mean, we're talking about the [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=96.8s)]
*  Social Security Administration in which field offices were shut down. By the way, I think [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=101.36s)]
*  Georgia was impacted the most. They had the most number of field offices shut down as a result of [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=106.48s)]
*  what Elon Musk was doing. Elon Musk is the richest man on the planet. He doesn't need to rely on [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=110.80000000000001s)]
*  Social Security to get by in his elderly years. But for elderly Americans who do need to rely on [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=116.32000000000001s)]
*  it, too bad, we broke it, maybe we'll fix it later. One administration official told us that [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=122.56s)]
*  Musk's view was that if he hadn't fired so many people that he needed to rehire some, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=128.96s)]
*  it would mean that he hadn't cut enough. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=136.72s)]
*  You should fire more than you need to and then later you can rehire if it turns out you went [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=142.56s)]
*  too far. Yeah, because messing with people's lives like that, no big deal for him. I mean, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=148.24s)]
*  he's the richest man in the world and he already bought the presidency. So he gets to fire any [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=153.60000000000002s)]
*  of the masses that he likes and maybe we'll rehire him if it was unfair, maybe we won't, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=158.56s)]
*  who cares? Their lives don't matter, their careers don't matter, their livelihood doesn't matter, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=163.76s)]
*  only he matters. And look, this whole philosophy from Silicon Valley of move fast and break things, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=169.6s)]
*  if you're not familiar with it, it might sound weird because it's weird. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=177.36s)]
*  But what it means is in the business world is, hey, don't worry about following all the rules [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=181.28s)]
*  and etiquette perfectly, just keep going, grab as much of the market share as you can. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=189.6s)]
*  You'll figure out how to monetize it later, you'll figure out how to do it right later, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=194.4s)]
*  you'll put in processes later. But the most important thing if you want to establish [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=197.6s)]
*  your company is to grab as much market share as you can, in the beginning especially. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=202.4s)]
*  That's why they say move fast and break things, right? Don't get stuck on little things. I [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=206.32s)]
*  understand that philosophy and in the business world, you can argue with it, you can say it [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=211.84s)]
*  makes sense in some context. But in the world of the government, it makes no sense. When you break [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=216.16s)]
*  social security, just because you wanted to move fast by closing down a whole bunch of social [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=222.07999999999998s)]
*  security offices across the country, that's not acceptable. That's not your money to mess around [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=227.2s)]
*  with when you take money away from Medicare as they just did, right? No, don't break Medicare [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=233.04s)]
*  and figure it out later. When you fire hundreds of thousands of people and say maybe we'll rehire [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=238.95999999999998s)]
*  some of them because we know we broke things. We broke those people, those human beings, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=244.32s)]
*  but what's the big deal? They're not even rich, right? No, no, I hate your cavalier attitude. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=249.68s)]
*  I can't stand it and it's dumb. And all of this, by the way, smears populism, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=254.88s)]
*  because these are fake populist billionaires who don't care about the average person at all, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=260.4s)]
*  pretending to be populist. And so I don't wanna empower the Scott Besson's of the world either. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=266.64s)]
*  Right? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=271.59999999999997s)]
*  No, no, Scott Besson is, I mean, he's been part of the problem for a very long time in this [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=272.09999999999997s)]
*  country. So I didn't really have any hope hinging on Scott Besson's. But in regard to Trump's [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=277.67999999999995s)]
*  tariffs though, like the crazy astronomical across the board tariffs, Besson's a capitalist, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=284.4s)]
*  okay? They don't like these tariffs. So I don't know what he's saying behind the scenes, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=291.28s)]
*  but I'm not under any impression that he's cosigning to what Trump is wanting to do with [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=295.67999999999995s)]
*  tariffs across the board with some of our top trade partners. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=301.44s)]
*  Okay, let's talk a little bit though about the time that Elon Musk essentially told federal [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=305.35999999999996s)]
*  workers, you need to report to me every week, tell me what you did that week, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=309.92s)]
*  so you can justify your job. Well, an anonymous Trump advisor stated, how many people were fired [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=314.0s)]
*  because they didn't send in their three things a week or whatever the eff it was. I think that [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=319.28000000000003s)]
*  everyone is ready to move on from this part of the administration. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=325.36s)]
*  Now, one of the more interesting revelations though, has to do with what Trump had to say [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=330.0s)]
*  about Marco Rubio, who was also of course feuding with Elon Musk behind the scenes. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=335.2s)]
*  So they brawled a little bit. When the New York Times reported on a meeting they had in which they [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=340.8s)]
*  had a bit of a shouting match, they noted a big showdown between Musk and Secretary of State Marco [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=345.76s)]
*  Rubio. Musk complained that Rubio had fired no one other than a Doge employee. Rubio said Musk was [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=350.48s)]
*  lying and asked if Musk would like him to make a show of firing more workers, only to be forced to [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=358.4s)]
*  rehire them again. So Rubio was kind of like mocking what Musk was doing. Musk was unimpressed. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=364.96s)]
*  He told Rubio he was good on TV with the clear subtext being that he was not good for much else. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=371.44s)]
*  I'd like to say that they're both terrible on television. They're not charismatic figures, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=381.12s)]
*  they're awful. The exchange allegedly lasted for an uncomfortable period of time. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=386.47999999999996s)]
*  The Atlantic's reporting has given us a pretty damning insight into the exchange. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=391.59999999999997s)]
*  Quote, that was one of the turning points for Trump and Marco, where Trump realized Marco had [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=396.56s)]
*  a little spine, one Trump ally told us. Okay, let's pause there. So Donald Trump appointed [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=403.35999999999996s)]
*  someone he believed did not have a spine to be the Secretary of State? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=410.88s)]
*  Well, I mean, think about why he was appointed because Miriam Adelson gave so much money to [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=416.56s)]
*  Trump and Marco Rubio is a neocon and Miriam wanted him to be Secretary of State so he could [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=421.59999999999997s)]
*  represent Israel instead. So to be fair to Trump, it's a fair assumption that he had no spine, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=426.56s)]
*  because all he does is work for his donors and other governments, not ours. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=432.0s)]
*  True, true. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=435.92s)]
*  So that's why I would have been surprised too that he called him little Marco. I used to call Marco [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=436.8s)]
*  Rubio a boy, right? So I'd be surprised if the boy had a spine and if it turns out at least with [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=441.44s)]
*  Elon, he did, which I'm fairly surprised by. Me too. Now Rubio was not the only one to slam Musk [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=446.48s)]
*  during the meeting. The Atlantic described what transpired as a pylon. But according to Steve [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=452.88s)]
*  Bannon, that meeting wasn't the final straw. So he told the Atlantic that the Musk fever [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=460.15999999999997s)]
*  officially broke when it was reported by the New York Times that Musk would be getting a secret [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=466.24s)]
*  briefing from the Pentagon on China. In Bannon's view, government officials had opted to leak to [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=471.92s)]
*  the Times rather than directly confront Musk or bring their concerns to the president. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=480.16s)]
*  A troubling sign, he told us, of Musk's outsized power. And we know how Trump feels about anyone [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=485.04s)]
*  around him that has outsized power. And so does Steve Bannon, because Steve Bannon [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=491.68s)]
*  thought he was in charge in the first term and said something he shouldn't have to an author. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=496.32000000000005s)]
*  Next thing you know, he was out and hasn't come back since. So apparently the note there is watch [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=500.88000000000005s)]
*  your mouth. And by the way, I don't like that, Trump firing people over his ego, right? But, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=507.44s)]
*  I mean, this is kind of an ironic kind of credit to Trump, which is that he does have an actual [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=515.6s)]
*  team of rivals in there. There's been a lot of fake team of rivals, but these guys really [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=519.52s)]
*  don't like each other. And they were at least in there for a while. So one last thing, it drives [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5kRNr_h5Y&t=524.96s)]
