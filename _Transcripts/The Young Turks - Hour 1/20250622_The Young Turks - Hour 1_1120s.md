# Democrats Are FED UP With Party Leadership
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM)
*  Democratic voters are fed up with Democratic leaders. We've been saying it for years and now [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=0.0s)]
*  we have yet another poll proving us right. The top line from the Reuters Ipsos poll, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=5.68s)]
*  62% of Democrats think party leadership should be replaced, only 24% disagreed. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=11.6s)]
*  By comparison, only 30% of Republicans thought party leadership should be replaced. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=19.36s)]
*  Jake, what do you think this says about each party's ability to mobilize and energize its base? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=25.6s)]
*  Yeah, I'm actually super excited about this poll. I've been waiting for this [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=31.76s)]
*  kind of movement my whole life because Democratic leadership is corrupt. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=36.4s)]
*  And so back in the day before this election when I said that, and they're also incompetent, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=41.28s)]
*  they're both, they're the worst of all worlds. So before you lose your stuff, if you're on the left, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=46.64s)]
*  so are the Republicans, okay? So now, or if you're on the right, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=52.72s)]
*  but to continue about the Democrats. So before when I would say it, they'd say, no, no, no, no, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=59.28s)]
*  Mitch McConnell is deeply evil. Jane, did you know he took a billion dollars from [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=66.0s)]
*  in donations throughout his career and doled it out to all the other crook Republicans and they [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=71.84s)]
*  just serve their corporate donors? Yeah, we talk about that on the show 24 seven. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=76.32s)]
*  We just did the last story on it, right? And then I said, did you know Nancy Pelosi took a billion [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=80.24s)]
*  dollars from corporate donors in the same way McConnell did and disperse it among the Democrats, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=84.96s)]
*  etc. And people will say, how dare you? Mitch McConnell's Satan, but Nancy Pelosi is an angel. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=91.83999999999999s)]
*  No, they're all crooks. They all take campaign money. Those are legalized bribes. And then they [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=98.72s)]
*  do exactly what those donors tell them to do. Mo Brooks, a Republican from Alabama, explained [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=104.8s)]
*  when he was running for Senate. In order to get a chairmanship of a committee, you have to have [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=109.6s)]
*  a million dollars to disperse to the legislators in your party on that committee. And where do you [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=113.03999999999999s)]
*  get the million dollars? He said, Joe and Jane don't have that kind of money. So you get it from [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=118.64s)]
*  the industry you're supposed to be regulating, but you don't regulate them. Instead, you do whatever [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=123.91999999999999s)]
*  they tell you to do, okay? And that's true of Republicans and Democrats. But the whole time, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=128.64s)]
*  they kept up this facade by saying, guys, we're geniuses. We do four dimensional chests. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=135.6s)]
*  We do eight dimensional chests. So even though it looks like we're getting our asses handed to us [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=142.32s)]
*  by Republicans, but we're secret geniuses. And we know what we're doing. We're the only ones who know [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=146.32s)]
*  how to win. We're the only ones who can win. And I know we never do the policies we said we were [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=151.2s)]
*  gonna do. But hey, if you hang in there for another 200 years, we will incrementally eventually get to [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=155.44s)]
*  them. No, their donors paid them not to do those policies. And did they know what they were doing [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=160.88s)]
*  politically, strategically, the eight dimensional chess players? No, they got destroyed by Donald [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=165.92s)]
*  Trump, who I would be surprised could clear 70 in IQ points. And they got humiliated by him twice. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=173.2s)]
*  Twice, they said, you better not vote for Bernie. He can't win. The only one who can win is Hillary [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=181.68s)]
*  Clinton. Joe Biden is young and dynamic. He's the best Democrat to go against Trump again. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=188.88s)]
*  Would you come on, hairs red, a perfect campaign. And now we all know you're full of crap. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=196.24s)]
*  You don't know anything. And part of the reason why they never fight for you is because they're [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=203.04s)]
*  too busy fighting for their donors. So the fact that they are deeply unpopular is a wonderful thing, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=208.24s)]
*  not because I'm against Democrats, but because Democrats need way, way better leadership who [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=214.24s)]
*  actually fights for their voters. And other than Bernie Sanders and the people who support him, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=221.35999999999999s)]
*  I've never seen that in Democratic Party. They couldn't care less about their voters. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=226.07999999999998s)]
*  And you could tell, Sharon, one more thing. Whenever a Democrat gets into office, they go, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=230.0s)]
*  well, I could do this, but you really have, I'll do it if you guys push me to do it. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=234.88s)]
*  First of all, that's not true. The minute you start pushing them to do it, they all [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=239.84s)]
*  take your head off. You're a traitor. You're trying to help Trump, right? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=243.51999999999998s)]
*  And them and all the corrupt cronies on mainstream media. So, but even if that were true, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=247.83999999999997s)]
*  what a weird thing to say. Well, I got elected by telling you I'm gonna do all these things. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=252.48s)]
*  But the minute I get in, I'm gonna tell you I'm not going to do any of them unless you push me [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=257.03999999999996s)]
*  really, really hard to do that. Why do I have to push you? Yeah, I pushed you by voting for you. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=261.52s)]
*  And then you're supposed to do your part where you actually do it. But they never, ever, ever do it. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=267.52s)]
*  And then they turn around and go, my God, I can't believe we lost. Yeah, you lost cuz you lied and [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=272.56s)]
*  you served your donors instead. So the fact that they're deeply unpopular with their own voters is [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=277.68s)]
*  a blessing. Finally, thank God, open up your eyes, vote for people who are actually going to fight [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=282.32s)]
*  for you within the Democratic Party. Sharon. Yeah, and I think the poll is ridiculously skewed. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=289.04s)]
*  I don't think it's 62%, it's probably 90%. It's probably 90% who have this faceless, nameless, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=296.64s)]
*  lacking integrity party that they don't understand, like, don't wanna have a beer with. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=304.08s)]
*  I mean, it's literally time to burn the house down, maybe leave the garage up. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=309.36s)]
*  Bernie and AOC can at least have that section of the home. But there's no enthusiasm. They think [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=312.96s)]
*  you're dumb. They think you are spineless. You get into office and I'll say another thing they do. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=322.0s)]
*  We're here to serve all people, which sounds like an admirable thing. But if you ran on these things [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=329.44s)]
*  and this specific agenda, how come you can't get it done and you're constantly blaming the other side? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=334.16s)]
*  Even we had the numbers, you're blaming them. So I think that this is a hopeful situation to see if [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=339.12s)]
*  something can spark change, real change with both parties. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=346.0s)]
*  Well, let's take a look at what else they found in this poll. The poll found a gap between what [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=351.76s)]
*  voters say they care about and what they think the party's leaders prioritize. It was particularly [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=359.2s)]
*  wide on the issue of reducing corporate spending and political campaigns, where 73% of Democrats [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=365.28s)]
*  said they viewed putting limits on contributions to political groups like super PACs a priority. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=370.48s)]
*  But only 58% believe the leaders prioritize that. 86% of Democrats said changing the federal tax [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=375.76s)]
*  code so wealthy Americans and large corporations pay more in taxes should be a priority. More than [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=382.48s)]
*  the 72% of those surveyed think party leaders make it a top concern. What really stands out in all of [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=387.92s)]
*  these results is this disparity between what people say their priorities are and what they think the [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=394.08s)]
*  Democratic Party's priorities are. And you can see that here. And there's a bigger, much wider [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=399.36s)]
*  disconnect between what younger voters, 18 through 39, how they feel, what they prioritize and what [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=406.16s)]
*  they think the party prioritizes. Take for instance, universal health care. For Democrats, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=411.84000000000003s)]
*  ages 18 to 39, 81% say it's a priority for them. Well, only 66% thinks it's a priority for the party. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=416.96000000000004s)]
*  Across just about every issue, with the exception of abortion, younger voters don't see Democrats [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=425.28000000000003s)]
*  prioritizing the issues that matter to them. The disparity exists among voters 40 and up as well, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=430.48s)]
*  although the margins are much smaller. You can see that here. And there may be news coming on that [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=438.24s)]
*  front with regarding the Democratic Party chair, Ken Martin. His tenure may soon be over, not long [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=445.52000000000004s)]
*  after it began. His tenure has been marred by infighting, labor leaders resigning from their [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=453.2s)]
*  posts at the DNC and the ouster of two vice chairmen. Hasn't even been six months. Now, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=459.28s)]
*  party insiders and strategists are zeroing in on Martin, who they call ineffective. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=466.71999999999997s)]
*  The DNC is weaker than I have ever seen it. They have shown zero ability to chart a post-24 vision [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=472.15999999999997s)]
*  for Democrats, said a Democratic strategist with close ties to labor unions who was granted [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=479.76s)]
*  anonymity to speak freely. The longtime leaders of the teachers and state and local employee unions [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=485.44s)]
*  couldn't in good faith continue to rubber stamp what was going on with the DNC, the strategist said. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=491.68s)]
*  Other Democrats cited what they described as Martin's ham-handed approach to the DNC's [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=497.84s)]
*  influential rules and bylaws committee, which is charged with setting the 2028 presidential [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=502.56s)]
*  primary calendar. Martin purged members of the panel, including Weingarten and Saunders, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=507.84s)]
*  who had supported Martin's top opponent in the February election for DNC chair. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=513.1999999999999s)]
*  Of the 15 Democrats he took off the panel, 13 of them hadn't voted for Martin, according to an [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=518.72s)]
*  internal record obtained by Politico. Martin only reappointed four individuals for the panel [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=525.4399999999999s)]
*  who didn't back him in the chair election, according to the documents. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=531.4399999999999s)]
*  Those supporting Martin say his changes reflect a shift of power away from Washington and toward, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=535.68s)]
*  and more toward, state and local party officials. Time will tell whether the DNC walls close in on [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=542.48s)]
*  Martin, but in leaked audio published by Politico earlier this month, Martin told DNC officials, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=549.52s)]
*  quote, I don't know if I want to do this anymore. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=555.84s)]
*  So Cenk, what do you think about some of these issue-based polls and the disparity between the [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=558.4s)]
*  party priorities and the voters, but also whether or not Ken Martin is fit to even lead the party [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=563.52s)]
*  right now? So I'm gonna get back to Ken Martin in a second, but first on the leadership. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=568.48s)]
*  Do they actually wanna do things like universal healthcare, which 81% of Democrats want, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=574.4s)]
*  as you just explained? No way, not even close. If you did a secret vote among the Democrats in [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=578.4s)]
*  Congress, it'd come out like 92 to 8. They all take money from the drug companies, almost all, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=585.68s)]
*  almost all take money from the health insurance companies. They don't want universal healthcare. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=594.0s)]
*  They're lying through their teeth. I don't believe that for a second, they've never fought for it. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=598.0s)]
*  They've never even proposed it. They've never put it up for a vote. I mean, look, there's things that [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=602.48s)]
*  are less than universal healthcare, public option. It's polls at over 80%. Joe Biden said he was [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=609.9200000000001s)]
*  gonna do it. He didn't even propose it. They didn't even put it in a single bill. They're giant liars. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=615.2800000000001s)]
*  They're not gonna do any of these things. They're gonna trick you into voting for them and then [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=621.2s)]
*  do nothing so that their donors are super happy and bribe them even more. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=625.92s)]
*  So they're never gonna do any of those policies. Paid family leaves at 84%. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=630.64s)]
*  My grandmother could pass that and she's dead. I don't know how to pass a bill at 84%. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=634.5600000000001s)]
*  Then you're a moron and you should retire and you're not in leadership. You shouldn't even be in [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=641.2s)]
*  politics. You don't know how to pass a bill at 84%. Well, then Chuck Schumer, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=645.84s)]
*  Hakeem Jeffries, Joe Biden, you're all a bunch of total losers. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=650.72s)]
*  Please retire immediately if you can't pass a bill at 84%. They once proposed it as a standalone [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=656.48s)]
*  bill so that they could put the Republicans on the spot. Hey, are you for American moms or are you [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=665.9200000000001s)]
*  against American moms? Do you think they should go back to work the next day or do you think they [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=671.0400000000001s)]
*  should get 12 weeks off? I never thought about that. Really, you didn't think about it? Or did [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=674.72s)]
*  you get bribed by corporate donors to make sure that those are never introduced? And yes, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=680.5600000000001s)]
*  they're legal bribes because the Supreme Court says that money is not, money's just speech. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=686.5600000000001s)]
*  These corporations are just talking to them when they hand over million dollar checks. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=691.9200000000001s)]
*  And some of the drug companies literally give over a million dollars to some senators and even [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=695.44s)]
*  some leadership in Congress. So now there are some people doing the right thing. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=701.04s)]
*  Ro Khanna called out Chuck Schumer the other day. Why? Because Chuck Schumer, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=705.36s)]
*  when asked about, hey, are you going to limit Trump's ability to attack Iran, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=710.3199999999999s)]
*  there's a war powers resolution. It's been introduced by Tom Massey and Ro Khanna in the [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=717.04s)]
*  House. And also there's similar legislation in the Senate introduced by Tim Kaine, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=721.8399999999999s)]
*  which I'm surprised by. Okay, credit where credit is due, way to go Senator Kaine. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=726.96s)]
*  And Bernie Sanders. And Schumer is not backing it. And then when asked about it, he said, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=731.2s)]
*  well, I believe Congress and Senate Democrats, if necessary, will not hesitate to exercise our [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=738.0s)]
*  authority. What do you mean if necessary? The guy's saying that he's gonna start a war with Iran. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=746.96s)]
*  What do you need for it to be more necessary? No, he's not gonna do anything. You know why Chuck [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=751.6s)]
*  Schumer's not gonna do anything? Cuz he takes an enormous amount of money from AIPAC. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=757.6s)]
*  And so he's gonna serve AIPAC in Israel. He's not gonna do anything to stop Trump. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=761.36s)]
*  Although overwhelming majority of Democrats want him to fight back against Trump, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=766.88s)]
*  and especially on this war. But Chuck Schumer won't do it because he doesn't work for you. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=770.96s)]
*  He works for the donor class. So in terms of Ken Martin, he's a more complicated guy. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=777.6s)]
*  He has a career being a progressive and helped to pass good progressive legislation in Minnesota. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=781.84s)]
*  And they went after David Hogg. They had some real reasons and some bad reasons. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=787.9200000000001s)]
*  And but my assessment of that situation was right after David Hogg leaves and of course, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=794.4s)]
*  he's left. They'll go after Ken Martin. And so to answer your question more specifically, Jordan, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=798.64s)]
*  I'm gonna stay on the side of Ken Martin in this fight. Why? Cuz of all the people attacking him, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=805.28s)]
*  one gave his name and set it on the record. It was Rahm Emanuel. And Rahm Emanuel's like, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=813.6s)]
*  Ken Martin's gotta go. We gotta reclaim the Democratic Party. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=819.28s)]
*  Yeah, for corporate goons like Rahm Emanuel. So no, I'd rather take Ken Martin than Rahm [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=823.28s)]
*  Emanuel or anyone he supports a billion times over. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=830.5600000000001s)]
*  Martin's gonna go though, because this power struggle, the minute you start talking about [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=834.0s)]
*  directing power away from Washington into the states, he's got to go. And once Rahm, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=841.84s)]
*  who is unapologetically a bully and all the things that you said, Cenk, says he needs to go, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=849.0400000000001s)]
*  he's gonna leave them out of there. He wants to seize control back. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=856.4s)]
*  And this floundering party won't be happy until they get rid of all and anything progressive and [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=860.0s)]
*  not even worry about fighting Trump. Let him take care of himself. Let him burn himself out. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=867.52s)]
*  That's not really their goal, as you put it, and I agree. They don't work for everyday [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=872.96s)]
*  grassroots people. And yes, David Hogg was a shield, the last line of defense for Martin, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=878.24s)]
*  and now he's gone. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=885.6s)]
*  And they do this to us every time, but Jordan, what do you think? [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=886.48s)]
*  On that front, I mean, I'm not so concerned with Rahm Emanuel criticizing Ken Martin. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=889.92s)]
*  I'm not surprised he is. I think it's for different reasons why I or others might [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=896.64s)]
*  criticize Ken Martin. David Hogg, what he proposed was supporting outside primary challengers. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=901.84s)]
*  And for that reason, he drew the ire of Martin. And Martin specifically didn't push him out, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=908.96s)]
*  but Martin wasn't happy with that plan. He was ousted by other members of the DNC [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=915.6s)]
*  because somebody challenged the election results and the procedures. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=922.1600000000001s)]
*  It was tiki-tack. But I don't think that Martin is well equipped to manage this party right now. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=926.64s)]
*  The infighting is a problem in part because of him. Because on the one hand, he's saying, [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=937.6s)]
*  oh, I wanna bring this influence and this power back to the states. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=942.48s)]
*  You're gonna draw the ire of establishment folks. But also, he's keeping people like Hogg [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=946.72s)]
*  at arm's length or worse. And that's going to draw the ire of progressives who want [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=953.0400000000001s)]
*  fresh blood in the party. So he's speaking out of both sides of his mouth. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=958.5600000000001s)]
*  He's trying to appease everybody. In the end, he's appeasing nobody. It's just ineffectual. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=963.6s)]
*  And I think that was the through line with much of the criticism. He isn't handling this internal [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=968.5600000000001s)]
*  fighting well. He has fractured an already broken and feeble party. And now people think he's weak [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=973.9200000000001s)]
*  and whiny and they're tired of him. I mean, he said it himself, I don't know if I can do this [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=982.32s)]
*  anymore. Then leave, man. If you're not fully committed, get out of there. What are you doing [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=986.48s)]
*  this for? All right, three things. Number one, your criticism is valid, Jordan. And so that's [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=991.12s)]
*  why everybody should do nuance. You have criticism that's illegitimate. You could have criticism [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=995.5200000000001s)]
*  that is legitimate. And then you make up your mind, okay, which way is better off? So even though I [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=1000.08s)]
*  understand what Jordan's saying, I'm now even more sure Ken Martin is a better option [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=1005.0400000000001s)]
*  than whoever Rahm Emanuel and the corporate goons are gonna pick next. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=1012.24s)]
*  The minute Ken Martin leaves, they're gonna pick someone deeply, deeply corporate. They're [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=1015.76s)]
*  definitely going to try to rig the next primary in favor of a corporate candidate. Rahm Emanuel's [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=1020.24s)]
*  back and he's doing all this stuff behind the scenes. And so he's gonna pick the very worst [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=1026.72s)]
*  person. But the last thing I'll say is, look, we're gonna find out who Ken Martin is. What do I know? [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=1032.72s)]
*  He's not my uncle. So that's another thing that Jordan's right about. So if you say, [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=1040.16s)]
*  golly gee, I'm being attacked. This fight is too tough. Then yeah, I guess you aren't the right guy [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=1046.8s)]
*  for the job. But if you stay in fight and you prove yourself to be a progressive and you beat back the [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=1051.76s)]
*  establishment, then you'd be a folk hero. But if you wanna just quit, then okay, then I guess [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=1058.16s)]
*  you kinda screw over progressives by quitting. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=1064.96s)]
*  And I'm sure we'll get someone even way, way worse. But let's find out who Ken Martin is. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=1067.3600000000001s)]
*  Is he a fighter and is he a progressive? It's only one person who could tell us that, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=1074.56s)]
*  and that's Ken Martin. And not through his words, but through his actions. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=1078.32s)]
*  Okay. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=1084.8s)]
*  I agree. It's over. But I was gonna say that, I just think it's a far going conclusion. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=1085.62s)]
*  And I think that Rahm Emanuel is gonna take over the party. Perhaps it won't be him, [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=1092.6599999999999s)]
*  but it'll be someone who props up. Because as you said, the fix is in, the primary is [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=1096.18s)]
*  already decided and it's gonna set us back. As a party, progressives, all of it, [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=1102.98s)]
*  I think it could be decades. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LQs-wveM&t=1110.5s)]
