"BRIAN KILMEADE (CO-HOST): If we were in Washington right now, in certain rooms we would hear murmuring in the Rules Committee because they are hammering through and trying to get the bill ready to be voted for on the floor by tomorrow. If it has the current structure it has right now and let's say it gets through, what should American people know? How is this going to affect them?"

TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.

TYT‚Äôs 24/7 programming is available on YouTube TV, Samsung TV, Plus, Roku, Xumo, TCLtv+, Fubo, and more.

# Fox News' Kilmeade Makes ABSURD Claim About Medicaid Recipients
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [May 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk)
*  Medicaid got way too big because [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=0.0s)]
*  Barack Obama made Obamacare and [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=1.76s)]
*  all those states got the free [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=3.42s)]
*  money. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=4.94s)]
*  And now all of a sudden, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=5.46s)]
*  Medicaid doesn't look anything like [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=6.7s)]
*  it was supposed to and it's 95% [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=8.5s)]
*  financed by the federal government [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=10.18s)]
*  is the state program. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=12.0s)]
*  And the longer we leave it that way, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  the more permanent that becomes. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=15.18s)]
*  Right, because people get addicted [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=17.06s)]
*  to the free money. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=18.86s)]
*  Yes, people get addicted to that [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=20.02s)]
*  free money. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=21.98s)]
*  A thing that you only ever say [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=22.82s)]
*  about the poor is getting some [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=24.740000000000002s)]
*  minimal return on the money they [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=26.7s)]
*  pay in through taxes. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=28.72s)]
*  If it's billions going to Elon Musk [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=30.36s)]
*  or loans that will eventually be [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=32.66s)]
*  forgiven going to rich people under [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=34.7s)]
*  PPP or whatever, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=36.86s)]
*  that's not free money. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=38.0s)]
*  They're not addicted. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=39.44s)]
*  It's only the poor that are lazy [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=40.3s)]
*  parasites. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=42.08s)]
*  But that is Brian Kilmeade, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=43.019999999999996s)]
*  a multimillionaire talking about [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=44.78s)]
*  how people who are in $17,000 a year [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=46.86s)]
*  have it too easy and they've had it [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=49.18s)]
*  too easy for too long and they [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=51.32s)]
*  really need to stop sucking off [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  the government. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=55.019999999999996s)]
*  And anyway, there was also some [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=56.239999999999995s)]
*  moral issues with what he said, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=57.980000000000004s)]
*  not just moral issues, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=59.84s)]
*  but factual issues. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=61.2s)]
*  It's not free money, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=62.42s)]
*  we paid for it. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=63.5s)]
*  That's what taxes are. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=64.38s)]
*  That's the states getting a return [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=66.1s)]
*  on the money that they paid. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=67.9s)]
*  Americans pay into it, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=69.18s)]
*  the states pay those taxes. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=70.46000000000001s)]
*  And also, the individual people [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=71.98s)]
*  don't get checks. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=74.34s)]
*  They're not cash and [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=76.34s)]
*  Medicaid checks. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=77.3s)]
*  It's going to doctors, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=78.18s)]
*  it's going to hospitals. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=79.3s)]
*  The idea that you're going to shame [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=81.06s)]
*  people for having the minimal [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=82.9s)]
*  health insurance that they're [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=84.54s)]
*  going to have with their incredibly [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=86.24s)]
*  tight incomes. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=88.32s)]
*  And you're being told that by that [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=89.67999999999999s)]
*  guy that doesn't have to worry [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=91.36s)]
*  about a damn thing for [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=92.92s)]
*  the rest of his life in terms of [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=93.96s)]
*  his money, in terms of his health [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=95.48s)]
*  insurance is just grotesque. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=97.1s)]
*  And Kilmeade, every once in a while, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=99.64s)]
*  he's one of the few Fox people that [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=101.52s)]
*  can say something that's not [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=103.16s)]
*  absolutely godawful. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=104.6s)]
*  But this is just terrible and [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=106.52s)]
*  he's not the only one, by the way. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=107.96000000000001s)]
*  We can actually show, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=109.6s)]
*  Maria Bartiromo has been encouraging [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=110.75999999999999s)]
*  the Republicans to be even more [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=112.68s)]
*  harsh when it comes to Medicaid. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=114.24s)]
*  Look, obviously you're zeroing in [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=116.14s)]
*  on Medicaid reform right now. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=118.22s)]
*  And unfortunately, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=120.14s)]
*  you don't have any help from your [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=121.18s)]
*  colleagues, the Democrat colleagues. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=122.98s)]
*  I mean, they are attacking you, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=125.78s)]
*  saying you're going to cut [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=127.98s)]
*  people's Medicaid and yet they can't [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=129.54s)]
*  even stay awake in the meeting, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=131.70000000000002s)]
*  right? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=133.38s)]
*  The House Energy and [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=133.98000000000002s)]

*  the legislation. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=136.14000000000001s)]
*  Congratulations to contain those [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=137.1s)]

*  Everybody was rooting you on, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=144.72s)]
*  you advanced the biggest Medicaid [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=146.6s)]
*  rewrite in the program, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=148.64s)]
*  60 year history yesterday. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=150.04s)]
*  Those changes expected to generate [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=151.79999999999998s)]
*  at least $715 billion in savings. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=154.11999999999998s)]
*  But this debate over Medicaid [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=157.0s)]
*  reform is now being framed by [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=159.11999999999998s)]
*  Democrats as a life or death issue. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=161.07999999999998s)]
*  Well, you've got $36 [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=163.92s)]
*  trillion in debt. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=164.95999999999998s)]
*  Isn't it time to start looking at [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=166.51999999999998s)]
*  the mandatory spending and [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=167.92s)]
*  trying to figure out how you're [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=169.12s)]
*  actually going to cut? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=170.48s)]
*  I mean, I know nobody wants to say [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=171.39999999999998s)]
*  this, but you've got to cut stuff [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=172.88s)]
*  like Medicaid, don't you? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=174.46s)]
*  So it's unfair to say that it's [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=176.3s)]
*  cuts as she encourages cuts to [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=178.02s)]
*  happen. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=179.78s)]
*  She's celebrating the over $700 [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=180.9s)]
*  billion in cuts while pretending [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=182.68s)]
*  that nobody's going to lose their [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=184.34s)]
*  health insurance. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=185.94s)]
*  And also saying the Democrats are [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=187.42s)]
*  being hyperbolic by describing this [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=188.94s)]
*  as life or death when she's [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=190.74s)]
*  literally talking about health [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=192.02s)]
*  insurance. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=193.54s)]
*  That's the area of life and death. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=194.18s)]
*  That's how medicine works. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=196.02s)]

*  can get away with this, Cenk. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=200.94s)]
*  They're just so [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=203.64000000000001s)]

*  Yeah, so I'm going to get back to [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=206.88s)]
*  free money because I got a great [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=208.6s)]
*  number to show you guys in a second. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=210.28s)]
*  First on Bartiromo, she's like, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=212.64000000000001s)]
*  this $36 trillion in debt. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=215.12s)]
*  I mean, it's outrageous. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=217.68s)]
*  That's why I'm in favor of [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=219.92000000000002s)]
*  a $5 trillion tax cut for the rich. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=221.20000000000002s)]
*  But let's make sure that we cut [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=226.4s)]
*  Medicaid because that'll show [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=228.16s)]
*  the pores, right? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=229.84s)]
*  Like know who your master is. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=231.42s)]
*  It's people who watch, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=233.57999999999998s)]
*  it's awful CEOs and executives who [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=235.22s)]
*  watch my despicable show, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=237.76s)]
*  Maria Bartiromo says, right? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=239.7s)]
*  She doesn't care about the debt. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=242.33999999999997s)]
*  She's never cared about the debt. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=243.29999999999998s)]
*  Every time she talks about [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=244.5s)]
*  the debt, she's a giant liar. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=245.38s)]
*  She's been in favor of every giant [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=247.5s)]
*  tax cut. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=248.98s)]
*  All she wants is more money for [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=249.89999999999998s)]
*  the rich. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=251.42s)]
*  That is a whole purpose of [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=252.22s)]
*  Maria Bartiromo, okay? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=253.66s)]
*  Now, next thing is, we asked the [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=255.77999999999997s)]
*  poll here in the live show, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=258.58s)]
*  shows live of course, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=260.76s)]
*  6 o'clock Eastern every day. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=262.04s)]
*  And you guys get to participate, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=263.88s)]
*  and so I'm curious what you guys [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=265.64s)]
*  think, is will Republican voters [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=267.40000000000003s)]
*  turn on Trump if he cuts Medicaid? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=269.32s)]
*  Okay, look at that, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=272.6s)]
*  even 59% already saying yes, okay? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=273.88s)]
*  I might drive that number up [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=276.76s)]
*  because of the number of the stats [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=278.16s)]
*  I'm about to tell you. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=279.76s)]
*  First of all, they're going to cut [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=281.16s)]
*  over 8 million people from Medicaid. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=282.48s)]
*  If you think those are all [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=284.04s)]
*  Democrats, you don't know anything [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=285.28000000000003s)]
*  about Medicaid in this country, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=287.16s)]
*  okay? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=288.84000000000003s)]
*  So at least half of those folks are [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=289.7s)]
*  Republicans. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=292.26s)]
*  So there goes 4 million votes, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=293.90000000000003s)]
*  because you think they're going to [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=295.86s)]
*  be like, Trump cut my Medicaid. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=297.84000000000003s)]
*  I guarantee you what they're going [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=299.58s)]
*  to say is, I thought he was going [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=301.36s)]
*  to cut other people's Medicaid. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=302.94s)]
*  Or I thought that he wasn't going [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=304.78000000000003s)]
*  to touch Medicaid. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=306.34000000000003s)]
*  He said he wasn't going to touch [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=307.54s)]
*  Medicaid. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=308.78000000000003s)]
*  No, no, no, he's uniparty. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=309.62s)]
*  He's an establishment Republican [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=311.14s)]
*  who serves the rich. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=312.82s)]
*  And this is going to be [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=314.06s)]
*  a giant wake up call. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=314.78000000000003s)]
*  By the way, by the end of this [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=315.66s)]
*  process, they'll have cut 15 [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=317.22s)]
*  million people from Medicaid, okay? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=319.2s)]
*  So now the next part of that is 62% [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=322.03999999999996s)]
*  of Republicans either have been on [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=324.52s)]
*  Medicaid themselves or know someone [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=326.91999999999996s)]
*  else that has been on Medicaid. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=329.35999999999996s)]
*  So when you cut Medicaid, you think [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=331.96s)]
*  there's going to be no consequences [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=333.12s)]
*  for Republicans, you're wrong. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=334.32s)]
*  So will hardcore MAGA be like, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=336.03999999999996s)]
*  yes, cut, cut, cut more. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=338.08s)]
*  Yes, they will. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=340.28s)]
*  But not all of Trump's voters, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=341.79999999999995s)]
*  tens of millions of Americans are [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=343.79999999999995s)]
*  hardcore MAGA. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=345.79999999999995s)]
*  A lot of them have no idea what [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=347.0s)]
*  Trump is about to do. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=348.4s)]
*  And they're going to get in for [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=349.78s)]
*  a rude awakening. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=350.78s)]
*  In fact, here's graphic two. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=351.46s)]
*  In the most recent KFF tracking [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=353.7s)]
*  poll, more than three-fourths of [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=356.14s)]
*  Americans held favorable views of [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=358.78s)]
*  Medicaid, 77%, including 6 in 10 [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=361.41999999999996s)]
*  Republicans, 63%, and at least 8 in [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=364.14s)]
*  10 independents and Democrats, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=367.14s)]
*  81% for independents, 87% for [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=369.58s)]
*  Democrats. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=371.94s)]
*  So 63% of Republicans like [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=373.17999999999995s)]
*  Medicaid and [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=375.17999999999995s)]
*  they don't want you to cut it. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=377.12s)]
*  And they're going to cut it, and [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=378.91999999999996s)]
*  what is it in service of? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=380.36s)]
*  And that leads me to my final [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=381.44s)]
*  number. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=383.24s)]
*  So free money, okay, well, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=384.0s)]
*  they're cutting a tremendous amount [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=385.8s)]
*  from Medicaid. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=388.32s)]
*  They're going to also cut from [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=389.52s)]
*  Affordable Care Act, and [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=391.32s)]
*  they're also going to cut SNAP, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=392.94s)]
*  that's food stamps. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=394.88s)]
*  That's 1.1 trillion in cuts. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=396.47999999999996s)]
*  Well, that's a lot of cuts, okay? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=398.15999999999997s)]
*  I mean, it's kind of terrible who [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=399.59999999999997s)]
*  they're cutting from, but [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=401.56s)]
*  at least that's a number, right? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=403.08s)]
*  So where's that 1.1 trillion? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=404.8s)]
*  Finally, Maria Barbarosa is so [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=406.09999999999997s)]
*  happy because it's going to make [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=408.26s)]
*  sure that we pay down the debt, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=410.5s)]
*  right? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=412.74s)]
*  Nope, it is going to tax cuts for [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=413.26s)]
*  people with incomes above $500,000. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=416.21999999999997s)]
*  The entire 1.1 trillion is just for [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=420.14s)]
*  people making over $500,000 a year. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=424.26s)]
*  It is literally robbing the poor [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=430.7s)]
*  to pay the rich. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=432.86s)]
*  If you think this is populism, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=434.48s)]
*  you might want to buy a dictionary. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=436.2s)]
*  Yeah, this is going to be deeply [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=438.24s)]
*  unpopular. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=440.36s)]
*  It's going to be a disaster. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=441.44s)]
*  There's just no way to justify [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=443.2s)]
*  cutting Medicaid, which this idea [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=445.64s)]
*  of free money, as if it's [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=448.76s)]
*  an extravagance that people are [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=450.92s)]
*  participating in when they go to [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=453.44s)]
*  the doctor when they're sick. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=456.0s)]
*  That's what they're selling this as, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=459.2s)]
*  people getting free money, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=462.46s)]
*  some entitlement or whatever. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=464.26s)]
*  Meaning they get to go to the doctor [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=467.06s)]
*  when they have medical issues. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=469.06s)]
*  And in order to, again, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=471.14s)]
*  the richest people in our country, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=472.94s)]

*  $500,000 or more, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=478.46s)]
*  it's unconscionable. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3EXPk5bXk&t=480.1s)]
