"Benjamin Netanyahu has made it clear: His decision to allow a minuscule amount of aid to enter Gaza is a tactical one aimed at quieting international condemnation of Israel‚Äôs forced starvation of Gaza and to clear the path of a final solution imposed on the Palestinians of Gaza."

TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.

TYT‚Äôs 24/7 programming is available on YouTube TV, Samsung TV, Plus, Roku, Xumo, TCLtv+, Fubo, and more.

TYT is also available as a podcast on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, TuneIn, Amazon Music, and more.

# Trump Says Gazans Should Be TOTALLY DISPLACED
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [May 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA)
*  And you think the Israel Hamas, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=0.0s)]
*  the situation in Gaza is going to [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=1.98s)]
*  come to an end soon? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=4.0200000000000005s)]
*  The Gaza is a nasty place. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=6.5s)]
*  It's been that way for years. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=8.540000000000001s)]
*  I think it should become [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=9.620000000000001s)]
*  a free zone, freedom. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=10.5s)]
*  I call it a freedom zone. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=11.78s)]
*  It should become a freedom zone. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=13.540000000000001s)]
*  It doesn't work. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=15.18s)]
*  Every 10 years they go back, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=16.18s)]
*  they have Hamas, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=17.98s)]
*  everybody's being killed all over [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=19.06s)]
*  the place. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=21.18s)]
*  I mean, you ever see, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=21.94s)]
*  you're talking about crime stats. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=23.46s)]
*  It's a nasty place. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=25.86s)]
*  Are these people, these countries [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=27.26s)]
*  that you were just visiting, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=28.96s)]
*  are they going to have to be [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=30.200000000000003s)]
*  a part of the solution? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=31.200000000000003s)]
*  Well, they would be. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=31.8s)]
*  They would be. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=32.6s)]
*  I spoke to all three of them. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=33.2s)]
*  They would absolutely be. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=34.120000000000005s)]
*  I mean, they're really rich and [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=35.28s)]
*  really, really, really, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=37.04s)]
*  even more than rich. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=38.56s)]
*  They're good people. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=39.8s)]
*  And they would help. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=41.24s)]
*  And so money's not even [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=43.8s)]
*  the problem. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=45.72s)]
*  You got to get countries to say yes, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=46.72s)]
*  to take them. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=48.68000000000001s)]
*  Look, these are people that want to [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  be in the Middle East. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  They really want to be in [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=52.2s)]
*  the Middle East. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=53.0s)]
*  They love the Middle East. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=53.52s)]
*  I see that. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=54.400000000000006s)]
*  There's a spirit for [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=54.96s)]
*  the Middle East. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=55.72s)]
*  They didn't have to go to Sweden, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=56.4s)]
*  Germany, these different countries. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=58.5s)]
*  They could have been home in [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=61.379999999999995s)]
*  the Middle East if somebody had [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=62.82s)]
*  the brains to build beautiful [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=64.3s)]
*  communities. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=65.86s)]
*  Yeah, the US will take over the [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=68.62s)]
*  Gaza Strip, okay, and [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=70.38s)]
*  will ethnically cleanse Palestinians [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=71.78s)]
*  to Arab majority countries. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=74.1s)]
*  And I mean, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=76.98s)]
*  that's what they are, right? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=77.58s)]
*  They're just Arabs. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=78.66s)]
*  All Arabs are the same, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=79.42s)]
*  aren't they? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=80.38s)]
*  They want to be in the Middle East. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=81.18s)]
*  What difference does it make if we [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=82.34s)]
*  force them off of the land they're [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=83.7s)]
*  entitled to? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=85.22s)]
*  Their own land, okay? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=86.24s)]
*  It's so disgusting. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=88.16s)]
*  So then there was this [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=90.16s)]
*  Barak Ravid thing. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=91.08s)]
*  Let's talk a little bit about [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=92.96s)]
*  Barak Ravid over at Axios, right? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=94.12s)]
*  Doing the same BS that he did for [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=95.44s)]
*  Biden, right? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=97.8s)]
*  The constant laundering. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=99.32s)]
*  Yeah, my sources tell me that Joe [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=101.12s)]
*  Biden's applying a lot of pressure [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=102.88s)]
*  for a ceasefire. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=104.72s)]
*  And then we find out after Joe [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=105.8s)]
*  Biden's no longer in office, and [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=107.28s)]
*  this is based on what the Israeli [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=109.0s)]
*  government has said in Israeli [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=110.68s)]
*  press, we didn't get any pressure [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=112.28s)]
*  from Biden for a ceasefire. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=114.24s)]
*  We didn't get any pressure. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=116.34s)]
*  So then Barak Ravid tries the same [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=117.62s)]
*  garbage when it comes to [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=119.46s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=120.82s)]
*  Saying that Donald Trump saw he's [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=121.82s)]
*  very disturbed by these images of [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=124.22s)]
*  these starving children, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=126.5s)]
*  these children who are maimed. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=128.3s)]
*  He's applying pressure on Israel. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=130.42s)]
*  No, he's not. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=132.44s)]
*  No, he's not. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=133.58s)]
*  There's no reason to believe that [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=134.34s)]
*  Donald Trump is applying pressure [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=136.54s)]
*  on Israel to stop the slaughter in [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=138.74s)]
*  Gaza, no evidence whatsoever. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=140.8s)]
*  Later on though, I guess to his [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=142.54s)]
*  credit to some extent, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=144.76000000000002s)]
*  here's what Barak Ravid wrote. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=146.20000000000002s)]
*  An Israeli official told me that at [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=148.4s)]
*  the moment Netanyahu doesn't feel [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=149.88s)]
*  strong pressure from Trump. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=151.4s)]
*  If the president wants a hostage and [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=153.28s)]
*  ceasefire deal in Gaza, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=154.8s)]
*  he needs to put much more pressure [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=155.96s)]
*  on both sides, the official said. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=157.62s)]
*  I don't believe Trump is applying [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=159.92000000000002s)]
*  any pressure at all. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=160.96s)]
*  I think that might be one of [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=161.84s)]
*  the few examples of Netanyahu [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=163.08s)]
*  telling the truth. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=164.4s)]
*  I think Netanyahu would love Trump [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=165.48000000000002s)]
*  to go to war with Iran on behalf of [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=167.64000000000001s)]
*  Israel, and that's the one area [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=169.64000000000001s)]
*  where there's some resistance from [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=171.52s)]
*  But as it pertains to Palestinians [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=173.66s)]
*  in the Gaza Strip, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=175.22s)]
*  Trump doesn't give a damn. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=176.06s)]
*  He sees this as a business [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=177.22s)]
*  opportunity for himself. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=178.54s)]
*  Let's be clear about that. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=180.22s)]
*  Yeah, so there is one thing that [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=181.5s)]
*  Trump has done or a series of [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=183.26s)]
*  things that Trump has done that's [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=184.7s)]
*  real. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=186.5s)]
*  So he circumvented Israel on doing [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=187.01999999999998s)]
*  a deal with the Houthis. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=189.01999999999998s)]
*  He did not agree to attack Iran as [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=190.82s)]
*  Netanyahu ordered him to. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=192.82s)]
*  And he circumvented the Israelis in [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=195.01999999999998s)]
*  getting the American hostage back [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=196.89999999999998s)]
*  home. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=198.62s)]
*  So those are three tangible things [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=199.14s)]
*  that he did that Israel was [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=201.14s)]
*  unhappy about. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=202.76000000000002s)]
*  And so Biden did zero things that [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=204.24s)]
*  Israel was unhappy about. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=206.84s)]
*  Biden was barely awake, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=209.68s)]
*  obviously, right? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=211.12s)]
*  Now look, guys, I've lived in a [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=212.28s)]
*  gaslit world my whole life. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=213.88s)]
*  So when we would say these things [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=215.96s)]
*  that are super obvious, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=217.48000000000002s)]
*  mainstream media would say, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=218.52s)]
*  how dare you? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=219.88s)]
*  Joe Biden has wagged many fingers [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=220.76000000000002s)]
*  at Netanyahu. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=222.56s)]
*  He has written strongly worded [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=223.64000000000001s)]
*  letters, and you are being unfair [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=225.4s)]
*  and unreasonable to the beloved [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=227.20000000000002s)]
*  Joe Biden. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=228.84s)]
*  What happened now, guys? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=229.60000000000002s)]
*  What happened now? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=230.68s)]
*  I told you, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=231.86s)]
*  Joe Biden did absolutely nothing. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=232.48s)]
*  He's as guilty as anyone here. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=234.98s)]
*  Now, is Trump a good guy? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=236.62s)]
*  No, everything Ana said is true, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=238.66s)]
*  and he has promised to do [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=240.62s)]
*  worse than Biden. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=241.9s)]
*  But the fact that he did those [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=242.98000000000002s)]
*  three things is a tiny bit of hope. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=244.72s)]
*  Why? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=247.38s)]
*  Guys, do I think that Donald Trump [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=248.06s)]
*  is some sort of angel? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=249.94s)]
*  And God, he's such a humanitarian. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=251.22s)]
*  And there's a report out today that [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=253.3s)]
*  he's looking at the starving kids [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=255.14000000000001s)]
*  in Gaza, and that it bothers him. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=256.84000000000003s)]
*  Does it bother him? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=259.74s)]
*  That would be shocking, okay? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=260.56s)]
*  So, but what has happened is Qatar [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=263.32s)]
*  and UAE and Saudi Arabia have [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=266.24s)]
*  funneled a tremendous amount of [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=268.84000000000003s)]
*  money to Donald Trump. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=271.64000000000004s)]
*  Both to America in terms of defense [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=273.88s)]
*  contracts, etc., but [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=275.84000000000003s)]
*  also personally to Donald Trump. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=277.22s)]
*  And if you say Donald Trump will [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=279.72s)]
*  not be affected by that money, and [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=281.32000000000005s)]
*  you're on the left, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=283.08000000000004s)]
*  have you ever met Donald Trump? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=284.16s)]
*  Do you know who Donald Trump is? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=287.16s)]
*  Donald Trump is obviously [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=289.02s)]
*  affected by the money. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=290.22s)]
*  And if you're on the right and [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=291.38s)]
*  you think Donald Trump is an angel [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=292.64s)]
*  and would never be affected by [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=294.22s)]
*  money, again, I can't talk to you. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=295.58s)]
*  You're not on this planet, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=296.9s)]
*  you're on a different planet, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=298.26s)]
*  right? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=299.7s)]
*  So is it possible that the Arabs [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=300.26s)]
*  could out bribe the Israelis? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=302.86s)]
*  Yes, it is technically possible. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=305.98s)]
*  I hope they do. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=307.9s)]
*  And they do have more money, okay? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=308.58s)]
*  So how would it work? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=311.02s)]
*  There's two possible solutions [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=313.38s)]
*  here. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=314.86s)]
*  One is Israel goes in and [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=315.98s)]
*  does the smote, richenet, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=317.24s)]
*  and yahoo plan, where they keep [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=318.68s)]
*  them at minimal levels of near [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=320.48s)]
*  starvation. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=322.28000000000003s)]
*  They push them into the southern [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=323.76000000000005s)]
*  Gaza, and then eventually, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=325.6s)]
*  Trump does deals with Arab countries [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=327.34000000000003s)]
*  and some sellout Arab countries. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=329.40000000000003s)]
*  They're like, yeah, for money for [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=331.48s)]
*  my own dictatorship or whatever. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=333.6s)]
*  Yeah, I'll help Israel ethnically [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=335.92s)]
*  cleanse these people and [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=338.08000000000004s)]
*  steal Gaza and I'll put them in tent [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=339.6s)]
*  camps in Riyadh or wherever, okay? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=341.52000000000004s)]
*  Yes, that's Israel's plan. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=344.08000000000004s)]
*  And could Trump back that plan? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=345.72s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=347.2s)]
*  Is he more likely to back that [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=348.06s)]
*  plan? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=349.42s)]
*  Yes, okay. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=349.86s)]
*  There is a second plan. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=351.14s)]
*  The second plan is roughly [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=352.46s)]
*  speaking the Arab plan. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=353.9s)]
*  And so the Arab plan is, hey guys, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=355.34s)]
*  hey Trump, do a ceasefire with [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=358.21999999999997s)]
*  Hamas, get Israel to do it, and [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=360.58s)]
*  it's super easy. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=362.78s)]
*  You just say, I'm not going to [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=363.78s)]
*  give you any more money, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=364.9s)]
*  they'll do the deal instantly, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=365.78s)]
*  right? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=367.09999999999997s)]
*  It's not complicated. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=367.74s)]
*  We give them unlimited billions of [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=368.78s)]
*  dollars every year. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=370.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=372.21999999999997s)]
*  I literally can't keep track. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=372.71999999999997s)]
*  I thought it was 4 billion as [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=373.82s)]
*  a guarantee, then it turned out to [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=374.9s)]
*  be 8 billion. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=376.47999999999996s)]
*  But that 8 billion might have been [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=377.68s)]
*  on top of the 4 billion and [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=378.76s)]
*  earlier there was 20 billion. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=379.7s)]
*  My God. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=380.96s)]
*  So it's like it's unlimited supply [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=381.52s)]
*  of money to Israel because they [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=383.15999999999997s)]
*  bought all our politicians. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=384.5s)]
*  If you think they haven't bought [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=386.44s)]
*  our politicians and [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=387.59999999999997s)]
*  our politicians think this is the [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=388.32s)]
*  most moral thing to do and [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=389.47999999999996s)]
*  that's why they're sending them [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=390.4s)]
*  unlimited money, you're a moron. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=391.4s)]
*  Let's be honest, I'm sorry. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=393.08s)]
*  But that's like for P brain people. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=394.88s)]
*  No, but the politicians were not [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=396.71999999999997s)]
*  affected by hundreds of millions of [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=398.0s)]
*  dollars spent by the Israeli lobby [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=399.44s)]
*  because they're so morally pure. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=400.88s)]
*  You would have to be really one [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=402.64s)]
*  bottom 10% intelligence to believe [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=404.0s)]
*  that, right? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=405.74s)]
*  Or mainstream media reporter. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=406.70000000000005s)]
*  So in the Arab plan, however they [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=409.02000000000004s)]
*  do it, bribe Trump enough or [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=411.22s)]
*  whatever and at this point I don't [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=413.06s)]
*  even care, okay? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=415.18s)]
*  I just need that genocide to stop. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=416.22s)]
*  So then the Arabs would come in [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=418.18s)]
*  after the ceasefire and go, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=419.86s)]
*  we're not letting Hamas run Gaza [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=421.54s)]
*  Strip. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=423.46000000000004s)]
*  A coalition of Arab countries will [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=424.46000000000004s)]
*  send in forces to run Gaza Strip [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=427.06s)]
*  until they finally go through [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=429.54s)]
*  a long track record and [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=432.02000000000004s)]
*  gain independence and then you'll [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=434.24s)]
*  have an independent Palestine, okay? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=436.68s)]
*  That way, by the way, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=439.40000000000003s)]
*  you would solve the area for good. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=440.40000000000003s)]
*  You would have finally a peace [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=442.6s)]
*  solution like Israel and Egypt did. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=444.16s)]
*  In this case, it would be Israel and [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=446.16s)]
*  the Palestinians. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=447.72s)]
*  The Egyptian deal worked [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=448.68s)]
*  perfectly. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=449.72s)]
*  This deal would work, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=450.68s)]
*  the only people who say wouldn't [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=451.56s)]
*  work are people who think [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=453.0s)]
*  Palestinians are subhuman. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=454.20000000000005s)]
*  And no, they're such savage animals [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=456.0s)]
*  and they'll always resort to [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=457.88s)]
*  violence. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=459.24s)]
*  They're not like any other human [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=460.0s)]
*  beings. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=461.24s)]
*  No, every human being does a peace [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=461.74s)]
*  deal. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=463.12s)]
*  At some point gets beyond [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=463.64s)]
*  the violence, right? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=464.84000000000003s)]
*  Would that apply to Palestinians? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=466.08s)]
*  Of course it would. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=467.56s)]
*  If you say wouldn't apply to [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=468.2s)]
*  Palestinians, you're deeply racist. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=469.36s)]
*  Okay, so let's just move on from [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=471.32s)]
*  that. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=472.64s)]
*  So at that point, then you have [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=473.28000000000003s)]
*  an independent Palestinian state and [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=475.04s)]
*  an independent Israeli state. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=476.92s)]
*  And you know what happens? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=478.24s)]
*  One, Israel gets a safe haven for [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=478.8s)]
*  Jews and we all, the whole world, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=480.56s)]
*  and especially America, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=482.52s)]
*  polices that. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=483.92s)]
*  And the Arab coalition polices that. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=484.8s)]
*  The Palestinians get their [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=487.4s)]
*  independence and Donald Trump gets [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=488.6s)]
*  a Nobel Peace Prize. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=490.32s)]
*  Now, I know what people on the left [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=491.68s)]
*  are going to say, there's no way. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=493.14s)]
*  I know brothers and sisters, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=495.3s)]
*  it's less likely. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=496.86s)]
*  Way less likely. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=498.02s)]
*  But because of the bribes coming in [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=498.74s)]
*  from the Gulf, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=501.3s)]
*  it's now at least a possibility. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=502.42s)]
*  Since it's a possibility, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=505.42s)]
*  it should be accompanied upon all [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=507.14s)]
*  of us who love peace and [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=509.38s)]
*  don't want a genocide to work [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=510.86s)]
*  together to push towards that [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=512.74s)]
*  possibility instead of the [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=514.7s)]
*  possibility that is much larger. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=516.54s)]
*  Which is Israel finishes [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=519.14s)]
*  the genocide and [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=520.82s)]
*  they execute their final solution [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=522.2s)]
*  for the Palestinians in Gaza. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=524.5200000000001s)]
*  So the people who are in favor of [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=526.84s)]
*  the Israeli solution is almost all [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=528.8000000000001s)]
*  of Washington, almost all the [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=531.0s)]
*  Democrats and almost all [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=532.7800000000001s)]
*  the Republican politicians. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=534.24s)]
*  Less Democrats, the Republicans are [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=536.08s)]
*  almost completely corrupt. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=538.08s)]
*  The Democrats are only like 80% [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=539.5600000000001s)]
*  corrupt, okay? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=541.12s)]
*  And the opposition led by people [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=542.36s)]
*  like Bernie Sanders and [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=544.12s)]
*  wonderful people say enough, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=545.4000000000001s)]
*  enough, no more money, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=547.12s)]
*  not a nickel to Israel, okay? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=548.5200000000001s)]
*  But the people who want to do [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=550.9s)]
*  the right thing, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=552.26s)]
*  we have to unite. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=553.06s)]
*  If we don't unite, we won't have [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=554.14s)]
*  anywhere near enough power. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=556.1s)]
*  The other side is super powerful. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=557.98s)]
*  But at this point, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=560.82s)]
*  an overwhelming percentage of [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=561.74s)]
*  the American people are sick of [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=563.38s)]
*  this. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=565.02s)]
*  That every day we work hard, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=565.7s)]
*  we come home and go, sorry, hon, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=567.82s)]
*  but we can't afford a new TV. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=570.22s)]
*  We can't afford this. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=572.86s)]
*  We can't afford that. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=573.7s)]
*  Why? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=574.38s)]
*  We had to send money to Israel to [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=575.02s)]
*  murder more Palestinian children so [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=576.46s)]
*  they could steal Gaza and finish [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=578.3s)]
*  their final conquest, okay? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=580.04s)]
*  So sorry, I can't pay the rent. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=582.48s)]
*  We're going to be homeless. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=584.52s)]
*  Maybe we can go on Medicaid. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=585.8s)]
*  We can't go on Medicaid. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=586.96s)]
*  We can't do anything because our [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=588.36s)]
*  money went to Israel to slaughter [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=589.8s)]
*  these people. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=591.3199999999999s)]
*  So anyone who agrees with us, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=592.24s)]
*  again, I don't care. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=593.92s)]

*  the political spectrum, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=596.86s)]

*  there's something wrong with you, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=599.68s)]
*  right? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=601.4399999999999s)]
*  I don't care where you are on [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=601.96s)]

*  put pressure on Trump to actually [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=608.22s)]
*  take the Arab deal rather than [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=610.5s)]
*  the Israeli deal. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=612.58s)]
*  It's not easy, super hard. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=615.1s)]
*  It's at least easy to understand if [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=616.82s)]
*  you care about the Palestinians. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpvmWo31dA&t=618.94s)]
