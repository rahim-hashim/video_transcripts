"Fox Business host Stuart Varney interviewed Rep. Randy Fine (R-FL) on Friday and kicked off the interview by asking him about Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN), who angered the right on Thursday by walking away from a reporter asking for a statement about the shooting of two Israeli embassy staffers in Washington, DC.

Fine made headlines on Thursday when he told Fox News, ‚ÄúIn World War II, we did not negotiate a surrender with the Nazis, we didn‚Äôt negotiate a surrender with the Japanese. We nuked the Japanese twice in order to get unconditional surrender. That needs to be the same here.‚Äù

# Randy Fine Asked If He Feels 'Comfortable' Around Ilhan Omar
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [May 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg)
*  You are one of three Jewish Republicans in the House. Are you comfortable working alongside [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=0.0s)]
*  Ilhan Omar? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=6.1000000000000005s)]
*  That's Republican Congressman Randy Fine, and we'll get to his answer in a second. But [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=7.98s)]
*  first, there's more context. In the wake of the shooting of two Israeli embassy staffers, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=13.02s)]
*  Randy Fine rushed to Fox News to offer this response. Take a look. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=18.98s)]
*  Congressman, there is a ceasefire deal on the table right now that the White House is [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=24.18s)]
*  hoping both Israel and Hamas will sign on to. Does this shooting change anything when [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=27.86s)]
*  it comes to the course of the war or the negotiations to end it? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=32.86s)]
*  Well, I think it speaks to the importance of the only end of the conflict is complete [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=36.86s)]
*  and total surrender by those who support Muslim terror. In World War II, we did not negotiate [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  a surrender with the Nazis. We did not negotiate a surrender with the Japanese. We nuked the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=47.3s)]
*  Japanese twice in order to get unconditional surrender. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=52.42s)]
*  That needs to be the same here. There is something deeply, deeply wrong with this culture and [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=56.300000000000004s)]
*  it needs to be defeated. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=62.64s)]
*  Now, Cenk, I want to bring you in here. Before we get to Fine's response on the question [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=64.3s)]
*  of whether he feels safe working alongside Ilhan Omar, what do you think he's going to [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=70.2s)]
*  say? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=75.78s)]
*  He's going to say something absolutely despicable because he's Randy Fine, a genocidal maniac. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=76.78s)]
*  So now I'm going to do the thing that I like to do, which is shoe on the other foot, okay? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=82.44s)]
*  So let's take out Muslim and put in a Jewish or Jew and see how this plays out. First, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=87.2s)]
*  Stuart Varney. Imagine that he's talking to Ilhan Omar or Rashida Tlaib and he says, now [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=92.2s)]
*  Congresswoman, Randy Fine, and by the way, throw in other, like Randy Fine is a disgusting [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=98.2s)]
*  guy, but throw in a perfectly innocent Jewish Congressman, Jamie Raskin. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=105.92s)]
*  Congresswoman, does it trouble you to walk by a Jew like Jamie Raskin? You're like, what [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=112.92s)]
*  in the world, right? And he says it about Ilhan Omar and everyone's like, oh, fine, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=117.4s)]
*  not big news at all. Nobody on cable news is covering it, no congressional hearings, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=123.04s)]
*  nothing, right? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=126.68s)]
*  Randy Fine on the original comments from yesterday that we covered that we just showed you parts [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=127.68s)]
*  of there. He says, not Muslim fundamentalist terror, not Muslim radical, not Islamist, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=130.82s)]
*  whatever code words that he just drops the code words and says Muslim terror, okay? As [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=138.57999999999998s)]
*  if all Muslims are responsible for any acts of terrorism. Okay, take out Muslim and put [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=143.45999999999998s)]
*  in Jewish or Jew. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=149.42s)]
*  Imagine if Ilhan Omar came on cable news and said, well, you gotta watch out for the Jew [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=152.06s)]
*  terror, and then went on to say, there's something deeply, deeply wrong with Jewish culture. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=156.35999999999999s)]
*  Because that's exactly what he said about Muslims, verbatim. When you say it about Muslims, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=163.98s)]
*  no one cares. There's no anti-Islamophobia task force, no universities getting raided, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=170.32s)]
*  nobody's getting arrested. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=178.66s)]
*  It's just a cable news anchor on television and a US congressman saying the worst things [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=180.54s)]
*  on earth and not a peep. But wait, don't worry, as Jordan's about to show you, Randy Fine [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=187.94s)]
*  can always take it to 11. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=194.62s)]
*  Yeah, let's take a look at Randy Fine's response to that question. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=196.66s)]
*  Constance, you are one of three Jewish Republicans in the House. Are you comfortable working [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=200.42000000000002s)]
*  alongside Ilhan Omar? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=205.58s)]
*  Well, look, I stay as far away from her as I can. Ilhan Omar is not pro-America, and [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=207.94s)]
*  frankly, she endorses and supports Muslim terror. So I think that what happened a couple [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=213.78s)]
*  nights ago for her is probably considered a good thing, not a bad one. And it's very [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=218.57999999999998s)]
*  troubling that the radical left created this. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=222.5s)]
*  Look, these protests are directly tied to what we've heard on college campuses. When [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=225.5s)]
*  they talk about globalizing the Antifada resistance by all means necessary, and that shows up [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=230.98s)]
*  in the manifesto from this shooter, that's where this stuff comes from. And it comes [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=237.04s)]
*  from Ilhan Omar, college campuses, and everywhere else. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=241.52s)]
*  Now, you may remember that both Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib have both been censured [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=244.52s)]
*  by their House colleagues for various comments that some in Congress found to be inflammatory. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=250.96s)]
*  Rashida Tlaib, for instance, was censured after saying, from the river to the sea, Palestine [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=257.96s)]
*  will be free, an aspirational call for freedom. Her critics said it was a call for genocide. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=263.28s)]
*  Now, Cenk, between these attacks that you're seeing here and Randy Fine's comments yesterday, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=269.08s)]
*  calling for Gaza to be nuked, will Randy Fine be censured? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=275.59999999999997s)]
*  Of course not, of course not. You could say the most bigoted racist things about Muslims, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=280.59999999999997s)]
*  Palestinians, etc. And Congress will do absolutely nothing. They might cheer you on. They'll [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=288.64000000000004s)]
*  be like, wait, Randy, do you need us to send a bigger check to Israel? Because we can do [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=293.84000000000003s)]
*  that, because they haven't slaughtered enough Muslims yet, right? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=297.84000000000003s)]
*  And then look at all the lies and terrible things he says, that Ilhan Omar endorsed what [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=301.24s)]
*  happened yesterday, the shooting of the two Israeli embassy staffers. Of course, she did [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=305.92s)]
*  the exact opposite. She condemned it strongly, as any decent person would, of course. But [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=310.40000000000003s)]
*  he just goes out and lies and smears her like that. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=316.28000000000003s)]
*  But by the way, Randy Fine, on the other hand, has endorsed the slaughter of 53,000 people [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=319.44s)]
*  in Gaza. That's literal, right? He says, she's endorsing terror. And so is, by the way, apparently [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=324.0s)]
*  all college campuses. Okay, so if you're an American on a college campus, Randy Fine thinks [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=329.24s)]
*  that you're supporting terrorism. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=334.72s)]
*  You better shut up, otherwise, Randy Fine is gonna make sure that if you criticize Israel, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=337.96000000000004s)]
*  you're gonna be in a lot of trouble, and he's gonna call you a terrorist, okay? Now, meanwhile, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=343.6s)]
*  he literally said yesterday, let's nuke Gaza, which would murder 2 million people, which [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=349.8s)]
*  is at a minimum terrorism. I mean, at a minimum, that would be the lightest thing I would call [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=356.4s)]
*  it, right? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=364.36s)]
*  Total genocidal maniac, and he's like, you see what's wrong with the Muslims? The Muslims [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=365.92s)]
*  love terrorism. That's why I wanna slaughter them all. Okay, no, I don't see it. I see [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=370.16s)]
*  a monster, a pig, and a fascist. And if you're in his district and you don't vote that guy [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=374.92s)]
*  out, and by the way, among all other things, as he funnels all of your money to Israel, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=381.04s)]
*  okay, all right, enjoy Randy Fine. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=386.20000000000005s)]
*  I mean, that's your representative? Everybody in that district thinks, boy, no one represents [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=389.28000000000003s)]
*  me better than this monster. Wow, okay, we'll see in the next election if that holds. All [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=394.84000000000003s)]
*  right, Jackson, what do you think? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=400.8s)]
*  Well, to the point that you stated before about how you could just switch out Muslims [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=402.92s)]
*  and put Jews, the points he made by themselves are just lazy, cuz we weren't just in Germany, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=408.48s)]
*  just indiscriminately going after Germans. It was Nazis in particular, terrorist groups [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=414.84000000000003s)]
*  in particular. And then, nuking Japan is one of America's, one of the darkest things we've [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=419.20000000000005s)]
*  ever done. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=425.72s)]
*  It's one of the most embarrassing, unnecessary things we've ever done. The war was already [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=426.72s)]
*  over by the time that happened. Russia had already invaded and gotten in there. It was [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=430.8s)]
*  done, it was not necessary, and yet we still did it. And he used it as if like, see, we [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=435.84000000000003s)]
*  had to do it. No, we didn't. So it's as if he doesn't really have any depth or substantive [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=441.20000000000005s)]
*  understanding of the things that he's talking about. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=447.92s)]
*  Of course he doesn't. But as he pointed out, it's up to the people in his district to vote [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=450.88s)]
*  him out or not. But unfortunately, there's a big appetite for stupid in this country [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=456.32s)]
*  right now on all this. Just people in politics in general, there's just a whole lot of stupid [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=461.28000000000003s)]
*  going on. Otherwise, the Democrats would not have lost to Donald Trump twice. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=466.44s)]
*  Yeah, taking your shoe on the other foot analysis here, Cenk, we do have an analogous situation. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=472.6s)]
*  There was a Jewish man in Florida who saw two Israeli tourists in Miami, shot at them [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=480.24s)]
*  thinking that they were Palestinian. And did anybody rush out to say, well, we have to [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=488.12s)]
*  nuke Israel? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=494.88s)]
*  Did anybody rush out and say, like you were saying earlier, I don't feel comfortable working [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=496.52s)]
*  with Jewish colleagues in Congress? No, of course not, because that's ludicrous. It's [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=501.68s)]
*  offensive, it's bigoted. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=507.4s)]
*  And for some reason, that's okay if they're Muslim. That's for some reason, it's okay [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=509.52s)]
*  if Palestinians are on the receiving end of violence or if Muslims are on the receiving [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=515.64s)]
*  end of discrimination. And until there is a collective response to quash this out, this [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=521.2s)]
*  type of behavior isn't just going to fester, it's going to be rewarded. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=527.8s)]
*  Because like you're saying, Jackson, there are a lot of stupid, racist, bigoted people [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=531.92s)]
*  in this country, and they are continuing to be fed. They're throwing red meat on these [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=536.64s)]
*  biases and it is rewarded politically. So until people push back against the bogus criticism [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=541.6s)]
*  on members of Congress, like Ilhan Omar, like Rashida Tlaib, like the pro-Palestinian movement, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=548.5600000000001s)]
*  until they stop using college protesters as scapegoats, none of this is going to stop. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=554.64s)]
*  Okay, I'm going to say one last quick thing here. Ilhan Omar got censured and even her [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=560.48s)]
*  own House Democrats threw her under the bus and condemned her because she said about Benjamin [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=570.48s)]
*  Netanyahu and his influence in America, it's all about the Benjamins. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=577.12s)]
*  Yeah. Okay, that's literally his name and they're using lobbyist money, which is about money, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=581.76s)]
*  literally, right? That is apparently so outrageous, morally outrageous, that even her own party [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=588.96s)]
*  condemned her strongly. That's just about goddamn lobbyists. We all agree that it's about the [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=596.8s)]
*  Benjamins. I mean, it's absurd, it's insanity. Right wing, you really think that you should be [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=602.24s)]
*  censured for saying that lobbyists influence politicians with money? Really? Nobody thinks [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=607.12s)]
*  that, right? This guy says we should murder everyone in Gaza, no censure. No talk of censure, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=613.12s)]
*  his own party celebrates him. The Democrats do absolutely nothing against them because [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=621.12s)]
*  the anti-Semitism task force. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=627.9200000000001s)]
*  Look, is there anti-Semites in the country? Definitely. Am I worried about it? I'm a little [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=630.72s)]
*  worried about it, yeah. Okay, but if we're worried about bigotry, you think that there isn't more [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=635.5200000000001s)]
*  bigotry against Muslims in America? Well, you'd have to be insane to think that, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=643.7600000000001s)]
*  insane to think that. And here it is, perfect proof. He says murder them all and no one cares. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=648.5600000000001s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below, an angel gets his wings. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=655.6s)]
*  Totally not true, but it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRRHxnkeYVg&t=658.6400000000001s)]
