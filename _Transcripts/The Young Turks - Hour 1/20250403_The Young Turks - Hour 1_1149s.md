‚ÄúIn the long run, we‚Äôre all dead,‚Äù Sen. John Kennedy (R-Louisiana) told CNN‚Äôs chief congressional correspondent Manu Raju for The Lead With Jake Tapper. ‚ÄúShort run matters too. Nobody knows what the impact of these tariffs is going to be on the economy.‚Äù"

# Republican Allies HATE Trump's Tariffs
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [April 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24)
*  Look, I think it is a mistake to assume that we will have high tariffs in perpetuity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=0.0s)]
*  I don't think that would be good economic policy. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=5.08s)]
*  I am not a fan of tariffs. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=7.16s)]
*  If the result is our trading partners jack up their tariffs and we have high tariffs [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=8.8s)]
*  everywhere, I think that is a bad outcome for America. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=14.0s)]
*  Tariffs are a tax on consumers, and I'm not a fan of jacking up taxes on American consumers. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=17.84s)]
*  So my hope is these tariffs are short lived and they serve as leverage to lower tariffs [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=22.92s)]
*  across the globe. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=28.64s)]
*  Republican Senator Ted Cruz, who typically kisses up to President Donald Trump, has decided [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=30.16s)]
*  to come out against Trump's tariff policies. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=36.04s)]
*  In fact, he is hoping that Trump is bluffing here, that these tariffs will be short lived. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=40.08s)]
*  But the uncertainty about the future of the American economy has certainly had an impact [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=46.2s)]
*  on the stock market. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=51.56s)]
*  The stock market is just reeling over this news. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=53.36s)]
*  And they don't believe that this is necessarily going to be a temporary situation. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=56.6s)]
*  There are other people on the right who have been speaking out against what Trump is doing [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=61.72s)]
*  here. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=66.44s)]
*  But what do you make of this? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=67.44s)]
*  Do you think that Ted Cruz is right in his prediction that this is just gonna be temporary? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=68.44s)]
*  It fits in with exactly the theory I'm telling you guys. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=72.4s)]
*  And look, I want everybody left, right, center, everybody pay attention. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=75.28s)]
*  And if I'm wrong, hold me accountable, okay? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=79.6s)]
*  So I think that Ted Cruz is saying that because he knows that as soon as they do the tax cuts [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=82.2s)]
*  for the rich and for corporations, they're gonna get rid of these tariffs because the [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=87.03999999999999s)]
*  stock market wants the tax cuts and doesn't want the tariffs. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=90.75999999999999s)]
*  And the stock market and the donor class always gets what they want 100% of the time. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=94.12s)]
*  Do you think that Trump is implementing these tariffs in the short term to cause some pain [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=99.28s)]
*  among American consumers? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=105.84s)]
*  And then they're gonna be desperate for those tax cuts as well? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=108.52s)]
*  Because right now, Donald Trump's tax plan is not pulling well, it's not popular. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=111.32s)]
*  Because Americans aren't dumb, they know that it's mostly a big gift to the rich and corporations. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=116.25999999999999s)]
*  Do you think that he's maybe inflicting some pain on ordinary American consumers to drum [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=121.91999999999999s)]
*  up support for his tax plan? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=126.96s)]
*  Yeah, maybe that's a really interesting theory I hadn't thought of, right? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=128.48s)]
*  And so you might get a twofer there. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=131.48s)]
*  Don't worry, the tariffs are gonna magically raise $6 trillion so we can give away $6 trillion [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=134.51999999999998s)]
*  to the rich. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=138.79999999999998s)]
*  Also, boy, you could really use a tax cut now after I've punished the living crap out [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=139.8s)]
*  of you by raising prices so much. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=143.72s)]
*  That's an interesting theory. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=146.04000000000002s)]
*  There's a third thing here. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=147.24s)]
*  As we talked about earlier in the show, Trump actually believes in tariffs. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=149.68s)]
*  He does. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=152.84s)]
*  But in a comical way, right? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=154.0s)]
*  He thinks they're magic, that we can get rid of the income tax, it'll create trillions [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=155.76000000000002s)]
*  of dollars. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=159.56s)]
*  So I think he thinks it's a threefer, a word I think I just made up, where he thinks, no, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=160.56s)]
*  it'll work, right? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=166.24s)]
*  He's the only one who thinks it'll work. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=167.48s)]
*  Plus, the other two things, which is why the rest of his team are doing it, and he's also [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=169.56s)]
*  doing it. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=174.95999999999998s)]
*  So I think those are all reasons why he's doing this. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=175.95999999999998s)]
*  God, I feel there's chaos. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=179.04s)]
*  I feel internal chaos right now, right? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=182.51999999999998s)]
*  Because I feel like there's finally an opportunity to implement smart tariffs that could be beneficial. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=185.16s)]
*  Sure, tariffs are always gonna have some short-term pain, I acknowledge that. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=193.2s)]
*  But this was an opportunity to implement targeted smart tariffs that actually in the long run [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=197.32s)]
*  are beneficial to American workers. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=202.76s)]
*  And I'm just angry because I feel like an opportunity is being wasted here. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=205.64s)]
*  Yeah, actually real quick on that, and then I'm gonna tie later, Wisconsin and Florida [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=209.48s)]
*  election results to this story. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=214.78s)]
*  Yeah, it's part of why you're seeing the Republican rebellion. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=216.32s)]
*  But Anna, if you care about tariffs and doing it right, and you're a real populace, whether [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=219.16s)]
*  you're on the left or the right, and you think that it could help our manufacturing base [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=222.72s)]
*  if we targeted it right and executed it right, this is gonna do enormous damage. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=226.64s)]
*  We'll never talk of tariffs again. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=231.56s)]
*  After the short-term pain this causes, and after they pull it, and you don't get any [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=233.29999999999998s)]
*  of the long-term benefits cuz they pulled it, nobody will ever talk of tariffs again. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=237.2s)]
*  So if you were in that camp, that camp is about to be lit on fire. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=241.44s)]
*  Because guys, look, understand this, okay? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=245.04s)]
*  There's a reason why most of the jobs in the American economy are service sector jobs. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=247.51999999999998s)]
*  And that's because we have outsourced all of our manufacturing jobs, or most of our [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=254.44s)]
*  manufacturing jobs. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=259.1s)]
*  And I don't think it's been beneficial for American workers to just rely on the service [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=261.16s)]
*  sector for work. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=266.16s)]
*  It's been pretty disastrous. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=268.06s)]
*  In fact, the Lever had previously published this. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=269.24s)]
*  We don't have a graphic on it, but I wanna read it to you because I think this is definitely [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=272.72s)]
*  true and it's so weird to see things flipped around now. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=276.36s)]
*  Because they had written that when Bill Clinton rammed the North American Free Trade Agreement [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=280.0s)]
*  at NAFTA through a Democratic Congress in the early 1990s, the most Democratic trade [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=284.28s)]
*  exposed districts in America quickly became the country's most Republican districts. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=291.0s)]
*  So voters actually turned on the Democratic Party as a result of NAFTA and some of these [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=297.71999999999997s)]
*  free trade agreements for obvious reasons, right? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=302.84s)]
*  Those free trade agreements absolutely decimated American jobs. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=306.05999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, and by the way, there's something that no one's talking about in the context of all [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=309.03999999999996s)]
*  these trade deals and tariffs, etc. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=313.08000000000004s)]
*  Which is that the number one problem isn't that we have trade deficits, or even that [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=315.16s)]
*  other countries impose some tariffs on us. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=319.84000000000003s)]
*  The number one problem is that the trade deals are not written by us, as in the US government [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=322.44s)]
*  and our representatives. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=327.56s)]
*  They're written by corporations. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=328.56s)]
*  So all the trade deals are geared towards helping multinational corporations. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=330.70000000000005s)]
*  I mean, it's literal. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=335.72s)]
*  The legislators literally give it to the corporate lobbyists. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=338.28000000000003s)]
*  The corporate lobbyists write the trade deals and then bring it back. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=340.84s)]
*  So what do you think is gonna happen? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=343.84s)]
*  They're gonna let the companies outsource your jobs, cuz it's gonna cost them less money. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=346.96s)]
*  The corporation isn't going to write the trade deal to benefit you and give you higher wages [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=351.84s)]
*  and more jobs. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=356.32s)]
*  Yes, that's exactly right. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=357.32s)]
*  That's the actual cancer that Trump is not addressing at all, and of course, neither [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=359.4s)]
*  are the Democrats. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=363.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, and by the way, I mean, how did they placate Americans, not all Americans, right? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=364.15999999999997s)]
*  A lot of Americans have been angry and frustrated, and I think that led to a situation in which [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=369.88s)]
*  someone like Donald Trump gets elected. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=374.56s)]
*  But how did other Americans feel placated or get placated? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=376.68s)]
*  Well, it was through cheap goods, right? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=380.56s)]
*  You exploit labor in other countries. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=383.84s)]
*  They get paid way less, but it's okay. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=386.0s)]
*  Americans will be happy because they're gonna have their cheap plastic goods. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=389.48s)]
*  And look, for some, that was good enough, but for others, we'd rather have better jobs [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=393.08s)]
*  and American-made goods. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=397.36s)]
*  But look, again, I really do feel like an opportunity for those targeted tariffs is [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=398.92s)]
*  being squandered here. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=402.92s)]
*  Now let's move on to Fox Business, where Charles Payne got into a bit of an argument with one [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=404.40000000000003s)]
*  of his co-hosts. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=409.56s)]
*  So Dagan McDowell is her name, and she doesn't seem to be very happy about these tariffs. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=410.96000000000004s)]
*  Payne is a little more open-minded, take a look. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=416.76s)]
*  BMW is gonna rethink South Carolina because it's not going to import tariffed parts, engines [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=419.76s)]
*  from Germany, than to send those vehicles to export them. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=428.52s)]
*  So again, it will mean if that plant stays open, it will mean fewer jobs potentially, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=435.84s)]
*  because they're gonna make those vehicles somewhere else. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=442.21999999999997s)]
*  Well, where are they gonna sell them now? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=444.96s)]
*  They sell them to China. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=447.08s)]
*  They sell them to China and they sell them to Europe. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=448.16s)]
*  Every American customer who can buy a BMW could be replaced overnight by a Chinese customer. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=450.16s)]
*  They export them to China. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=454.32000000000005s)]
*  No, no, but I'm saying you can't make up for- [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=456.92s)]
*  They import the parts, which will be tariffed, and then they will export them from the United [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=459.24s)]
*  States where they're manufactured, back to Europe, where they will be tariffed again, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=464.20000000000005s)]
*  and then to China and nations around the globe, right? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=470.18s)]
*  So these are the problems that US manufacturer faces because the parts are coming from somewhere [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=475.46s)]
*  else. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=484.85999999999996s)]
*  They can also just make the parts here. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=485.85999999999996s)]
*  They can make the car there. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=486.85999999999996s)]
*  No, they can't. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=487.85999999999996s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=488.85999999999996s)]
*  That's a fallacy. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=489.85999999999996s)]
*  No, it's impossible. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=490.85999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, 10 years, 15 years, 20 years, how about it? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=491.85999999999996s)]
*  It wouldn't take that long. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=494.21999999999997s)]
*  Anyway- [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=495.21999999999997s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=496.21999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it would take that long. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=497.21999999999997s)]
*  I don't know about 15 years, but it would take several years. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=499.46s)]
*  Yeah, look, this is just anecdotal, but it backs up everything I've ever read. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=502.94s)]
*  One of our members just wrote in, I read it during the break, about how they moved the [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=506.42s)]
*  plant to Colorado. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=510.62s)]
*  Same exact plant in the US, it took 12 years. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=511.62s)]
*  Wow, 12 years? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=514.58s)]
*  12 years. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=516.3s)]
*  So these things, building a plant is an enormous enterprise. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=517.3s)]
*  It's not a thing you do in three months. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=519.98s)]
*  If you did it in three years, it would be amazing, right? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=522.82s)]
*  So these tariffs are not gonna be around for three years, 12 years, 15 years. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=525.76s)]
*  She's 100% right. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=530.18s)]
*  So Payne also spoke to someone by the name of Ed Yardeny for a one-on-one interview. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=532.1s)]
*  And Yardeny is not holding back. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=539.14s)]
*  I think he's just calling it like he sees it, and I think he makes some really good [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=542.02s)]
*  points here. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=546.14s)]
*  So let's take a quick look at that. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=547.14s)]
*  The markets interpreted as basically bad for the stock market, bad for the US economy, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=549.14s)]
*  for the global economy. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=553.82s)]
*  And I think there's clearly a real potential here for all this to add up to at least stagflation [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=554.82s)]
*  if not an outright recession in the second half of the year. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=561.9000000000001s)]
*  So the market's down because suddenly all that uncertainty is driving valuations lower [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=567.0600000000001s)]
*  and earnings expectations are being notched down. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=571.74s)]
*  But you know what? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=575.4200000000001s)]
*  I think that the reaction here, the stock market may get the attention of the White [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=576.4200000000001s)]
*  House. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=581.1800000000001s)]
*  I know they said they don't pay attention to the market, but they have to pay attention [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=582.1800000000001s)]
*  to a day like today. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=584.94s)]
*  A big drop in the stock market can create a recession by having a big negative wealth [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=586.9s)]
*  effect. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=591.42s)]
*  And I also think that there's gonna be a lot of negotiations going on here. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=592.42s)]
*  I mean, some of these tariffs are just ridiculous. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=595.82s)]
*  So not only that, later in the interview, Yardeny mentioned that Donald Trump really [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=600.1s)]
*  wants interest rates to go down. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=605.74s)]
*  He's been pushing the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, the head of the Federal Reserve to [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=607.42s)]
*  lower interest rates. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=611.46s)]
*  And while in this last public disclosure, the Fed did not lower interest rates. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=613.26s)]
*  They did say we're planning on lowering interest rates two more times in the rest of this year. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=620.26s)]
*  Now it seems unlikely that that would happen because how are you gonna lower interest rates [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=626.9s)]
*  when there are inflationary pressures brought forth as a result of Donald Trump's tariffs? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=631.62s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, so there's a whole host of problems here. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=636.82s)]
*  But first, I wanna address the stock market issue. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=640.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=642.3s)]
*  So some people, as in almost all mainstream media normally, say that if the stock market [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=643.3s)]
*  goes down, that's bad for our economy. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=648.9399999999999s)]
*  That's not necessarily true at all. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=651.42s)]
*  And they say, it's bad for the average American, the stock market goes down. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=652.8599999999999s)]
*  Well, it depends. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=656.8599999999999s)]
*  And now I think some of the Trump fans are making the opposite mistake. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=658.78s)]
*  They're like, yeah, we stuck it to the stock market and we stuck it to Wall Street, so [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=662.14s)]
*  it's good for the average American. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=666.3399999999999s)]
*  No, not necessarily, it depends, right? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=668.02s)]
*  So what does it depend on? [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=670.98s)]
*  So if we stuck it to the stock market because we decided that American government is going [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=672.4200000000001s)]
*  to negotiate drug prices, so the drug prices come down and we're closer to actual free [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=676.78s)]
*  market rather than this crazy monopoly, corporate cronyism advantage that Big Pharma has because [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=682.26s)]
*  they purchased our government, right? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=690.74s)]
*  Well, it's true, the stock market would go down because you would have the drug companies [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=692.5s)]
*  have reduced earnings. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=697.74s)]
*  But those reduced earnings were just profit taking off of us, right? [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=699.5s)]
*  The US taxpayers and the US citizens and consumers. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=702.58s)]
*  So that stock market going down would be a good thing in regards to that particular thing. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=705.42s)]
*  And you can't negotiate drug prices and not have those companies' stock price go down. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=710.38s)]
*  They will go down and they should go down. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=715.38s)]
*  Yes. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=717.1s)]
*  They're artificially inflated by basically robbing us. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=718.1s)]
*  So on the other hand, if you do tariffs like this and people go, all right, well, now the [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=722.1s)]
*  price of aluminum is higher, price of steel is higher, price of everything is higher, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=725.86s)]
*  right? [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=730.02s)]
*  Well, that gets calculated in because then you won't make as much profit. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=731.02s)]
*  That means your company's not worth as much and hence your market cap goes down. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=735.34s)]
*  So then that happens to enough companies, the stock market goes down. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=740.08s)]
*  That is not helpful because all you're doing is devaluing those companies. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=743.8000000000001s)]
*  You're not getting any benefit out of it. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=748.3000000000001s)]
*  Also it's hurting your pensions, the 401ks, etc. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=750.3000000000001s)]
*  So please guys, there is no easy answer for stock market go up or down, good or bad. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=753.26s)]
*  No, you have to look at the actual policy and see if it helps the average American or [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=760.02s)]
*  hurts it. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=764.46s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=765.46s)]
*  And you give a specific example. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=766.46s)]
*  There is no specificity here. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=768.62s)]
*  I mean a 10% baseline tariff on all imports to the United States. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=770.14s)]
*  And then you have that tricky, fizicky math that the Trump administration did to slap [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=775.66s)]
*  on much higher tariffs on specific countries with no rhyme or reason. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=779.4s)]
*  But people like Charlie Kirk feel that there is rhyme and there is reason and he's about [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=785.24s)]
*  to defend Trump in this next clip. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=789.4s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=791.0s)]
*  It's necessary. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=792.0s)]
*  We have been on borrowed time. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=794.2s)]
*  We have been on borrowed future promises. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=796.52s)]
*  And you are not a nation if you do not make stuff in your nation. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=802.0s)]
*  So you might say, what does that mean? [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=805.84s)]
*  A lot of tariffs, that's what that means. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=808.0s)]
*  It's gonna be a lot of tariffs with China. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=810.44s)]
*  And they could reciprocate. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=812.88s)]
*  And I'll be very honest, it might be harder to go buy piles of plastic that you do not [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=815.24s)]
*  need. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=820.0s)]
*  Do you want to be reliant on the Chinese Communist Party? [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=821.72s)]
*  Do you want to be subservient to a foreign land? [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=825.52s)]
*  Are we a colony or are we a country? [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=828.32s)]
*  Well, look, fact of the matter is, this isn't just about China. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=831.12s)]
*  This is about literally every trade partner that the United States has. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=836.52s)]
*  And these tariffs are not reciprocal, thanks to the weird math that the Trump administration [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=840.64s)]
*  used to determine which percentage they're gonna slap on to any given country. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=845.6s)]
*  Bad faith countries as they've determined or good faith countries, which get a little [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=851.72s)]
*  bit more of a deal, I guess. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=855.7s)]
*  But the way Charlie Kirk is framing it makes it appear as though this is just about China [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=858.1600000000001s)]
*  and plastic items that we import from Chinese manufacturers. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=863.6800000000001s)]
*  This goes way beyond that. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=868.5600000000001s)]
*  I mean, we're talking about cars getting hit with the 25% tariffs. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=869.84s)]
*  Foreign made car parts getting slapped with a tariff as well. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=874.8000000000001s)]
*  So even if the cars are manufactured here in the United States, if they're using parts [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=879.1600000000001s)]
*  that were made in other countries, well, that's obviously going to have a tariff attached [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=883.62s)]
*  to it. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=889.3000000000001s)]
*  And that's going to increase the value of the cars that are being sold in the US. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=890.3000000000001s)]
*  And so I understand the argument. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=894.4200000000001s)]
*  The thing that drives me nuts is I'm not just against tariffs. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=896.38s)]
*  Again, I think that tariffs make sense if there's a rationale, there's logic behind [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=901.38s)]
*  it, and it's specifically done in order to protect American workers and certain American [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=907.38s)]
*  industries. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=912.66s)]
*  That's not what's happening here. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=913.66s)]
*  Yeah, so there's an argument to be made that Biden should use a tariff. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=915.26s)]
*  But first, on Super Chat, Deb Long wrote in and was joking around about how he tariffed [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=919.2199999999999s)]
*  an island that only is inhabited by penguins. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=926.86s)]
*  So that's why it's so thoughtless. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=930.3s)]
*  Did anybody bother to check who we were tariffing, how much, why? [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=933.38s)]
*  What industry is the anti-penguin tariffs going to help, right? [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=939.92s)]
*  So now, the reality is that you could do tariffs that helped. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=944.5999999999999s)]
*  And in fact, we don't need to make everything here. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=947.36s)]
*  We need to make some things here, and we need to have some manufacturing, etc. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=950.52s)]
*  But especially things that could be related to national security. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=955.0799999999999s)]
*  So for example, Anna and I probably talked about the Chips Act under Biden more than [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=957.7199999999999s)]
*  probably any show combined, right? [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=962.04s)]
*  And so do we need to make chips here for semiconductors? [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=964.4399999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=968.92s)]
*  Is that a national security issue? [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=969.92s)]
*  I would argue yes, okay. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=973.28s)]
*  Pharmaceuticals, I think we need to make here in the United States. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=974.9599999999999s)]
*  I mean, during COVID, there were pharmaceutical drug shortages in the United States because [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=977.8399999999999s)]
*  the drugs are manufactured elsewhere and we had issues with our supply chains. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=982.4s)]
*  Yeah, so that would be targeted, that would make sense. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=986.0s)]
*  So for example, Biden, instead of doing the Chips Act where he just gave over $50 billion [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=989.4s)]
*  in corporate subsidies with no strings attached, and then Intel and other chip makers laughed [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=993.44s)]
*  in his face afterwards and fired a whole bunch of American workers. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=1000.2800000000001s)]
*  I'd be super curious to see how this debate would work out between economists, because [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=1003.8000000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=1008.4000000000001s)]
*  But I wonder if you could have done a tariff there on Taiwan that mainly produces most [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=1009.72s)]
*  of our chips for the semiconductors, instead of giving a giant $50 billion corporate subsidy, [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=1015.0s)]
*  right? [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=1020.8000000000001s)]
*  I don't know the answer to that, but that's how we should be thinking about it. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=1022.16s)]
*  Let's have an actual analysis of each industry and does it make sense or does it not? [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=1025.3999999999999s)]
*  And what's the best way to go? [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=1030.32s)]
*  But this was just a nuclear blast on all the countries, on all the different products, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=1031.72s)]
*  and it can't possibly last, it's way too drastic. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=1038.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=1041.44s)]
*  And by the way, and other members wrote in, and guys, I love doing the show with you guys, [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=1042.44s)]
*  you're making a lot of terrific points. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=1047.48s)]
*  So saying, this is gonna unite a lot of the world, including BRICS, right? [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=1049.58s)]
*  So those- Yes, yep. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=1053.02s)]
*  Brazil, India, etc. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=1054.46s)]
*  Unite them against us, that's exactly right. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=1056.74s)]
*  That's another reason why if you were targeted, maybe with Taiwan on chips, then you're not [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=1059.26s)]
*  uniting the world. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=1065.22s)]
*  You're actually addressing the need that you have. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=1066.6599999999999s)]
*  Instead, when you blast it out to everyone, you force them to unite against you. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=1068.86s)]
*  So finally, I promised, why are some Republicans like Ted Cruz and John Kennedy and Rand Paul, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=1073.22s)]
*  rebelling on this one when they normally never rebel? [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=1079.22s)]
*  For a couple reasons. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=1081.8999999999999s)]
*  Number one, there's just too many of them. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=1082.8999999999999s)]
*  And Trump, when there's only a couple, can go, primary him, get rid of him, right? [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=1085.1399999999999s)]
*  But now they're in open rebellion, so that's harder to do. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=1090.2s)]
*  Second of all, all of their corporate donors are saying that they hate this. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=1093.22s)]
*  So Ted Cruz reports to his donors even more than he reports to Trump, so that's part of [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=1096.9399999999998s)]
*  it. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=1101.8999999999999s)]
*  Third reason is Wisconsin and Florida, those elections just happened. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=1102.8999999999999s)]
*  This one by a lot in Wisconsin, and even though they lost in Florida, they made up [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=1107.18s)]
*  20 points in those races. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=1111.22s)]
*  Just a couple of months, Trump's in, and they already lost 20 points in Florida. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=1114.02s)]
*  We're lucky that they were deep red districts. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=1119.3s)]
*  So now the Republicans are actually worried, in the Senate and the House, are actually [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=1121.5s)]
*  worried about losing their seats and their power. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=1125.14s)]
*  And finally, as Ted Cruz pointed out, they all kind of know, they're not going to stick [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=1128.44s)]
*  around. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=1132.8200000000002s)]
*  Because of the giant tax cuts for corporations, these tariffs are gone. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=1133.82s)]
*  So there's not going to be much of a price to pay for opposing Trump on this. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=1138.22s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=1141.98s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below, an angel gets his wings. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=1142.98s)]
*  Totally not true, but it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4FS1XopA24&t=1145.74s)]
