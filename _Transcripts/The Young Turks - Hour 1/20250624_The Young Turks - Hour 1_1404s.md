TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.
The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.
On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.
Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.
Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.
TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.
TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.
TYT‚Äôs 24/7 programming is available on YouTube TV, Samsung TV, Plus, Roku, Xumo, TCLtv+, Fubo, and more.
TYT is also available as a podcast on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, TuneIn, Amazon Music, and more.

# TYT RESPONDS To Leftist Criticism
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc)
*  I don't care about the left. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=0.0s)]
*  I don't care about the right. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1.3800000000000001s)]
*  I care about results. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=2.58s)]
*  And I'm sorry, this false dichotomy, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=3.86s)]
*  this BS like tribalism has only [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=6.82s)]
*  hurt the country on areas where we [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=9.18s)]
*  can work together, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=11.58s)]
*  we should work together. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=12.74s)]
*  Trump has done some positive things [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=14.06s)]
*  today, which is a bit shocking. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=15.98s)]
*  So we'll see if it holds. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=17.82s)]
*  Brace for impact. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=20.18s)]
*  Yeah, I know, my God. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=21.06s)]
*  So I've been getting yelled at [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=22.98s)]
*  online all day. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=25.54s)]
*  So what's new? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=28.02s)]
*  I know, right? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=28.88s)]
*  You're saying that Trump enforcing [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=30.04s)]
*  a ceasefire against Israel is [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=32.36s)]
*  a good thing? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=34.4s)]
*  No, boo, we don't want Israel to [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=35.56s)]
*  have a ceasefire. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=37.96s)]
*  No, but wait, we do want Israel to [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=40.12s)]
*  comply with a ceasefire. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=42.04s)]
*  No, you have to hate Trump anyway. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=44.56s)]
*  Okay, all right, well anyway, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=45.96s)]
*  we'll adjudicate, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=47.2s)]
*  we'll sort that out, okay? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  I think one of the best things that [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=49.68s)]
*  you can do to kind of understand [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=51.32s)]
*  this current political moment, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=52.84s)]
*  because a lot of things don't make [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=54.36s)]
*  sense if you're kind of operating [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=56.0s)]
*  based on the old partisan lens. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=57.78s)]
*  I wish that things were as cut and [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=61.019999999999996s)]
*  clear as they might have been in [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=63.26s)]
*  the early aughts, but they're not. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=65.42s)]
*  They're not, and it's hard to make [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=67.86s)]
*  sense of how things are changing and [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=70.17999999999999s)]
*  realigning. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=72.46s)]
*  We'll talk about this tomorrow, so [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=74.14s)]
*  I have time to produce it, but [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=75.86s)]
*  Candace Owens was on Pierce Morgan [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=77.22s)]
*  today for a one on one interview. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=78.82s)]
*  That interview blew my mind, okay, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=81.3s)]
*  because everything she said was [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=83.58s)]
*  accurate, everything she said was [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=85.53999999999999s)]
*  true, and everything she said is [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=88.16s)]
*  reminiscent of what you would hear [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=89.96s)]
*  from a left wing show arguing [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=91.97999999999999s)]
*  against essentially aiding and [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=93.64s)]
*  abetting Israel in its genocide in [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=95.44s)]
*  Gaza, for instance. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=97.56s)]
*  Yeah, so I'll say it, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=99.72s)]
*  they had a whole giant Pierce [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=100.92s)]
*  Morgan episode about this massive [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=102.36s)]
*  split in MAGA. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=104.19999999999999s)]
*  But I went on Kyle and [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=105.84s)]
*  Crystal just a couple of days ago, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=106.88s)]
*  and they think there's no split at [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=108.52s)]
*  all. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=109.96s)]
*  No, there's definitely a split, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=110.47999999999999s)]
*  right? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=111.75999999999999s)]
*  I mean, but that's what they said, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=112.28s)]
*  so I don't know if they're on this [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=113.88s)]
*  planet, and when I asked them if [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=115.4s)]
*  they're on this planet, they seem [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=116.86s)]
*  to get mad, and they were, by the [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=118.7s)]
*  way, to be fair to them, they're [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=120.42s)]
*  representing their audience, and [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=122.06s)]
*  their audience doesn't see it at [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=123.9s)]
*  all. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=125.62s)]
*  That's because they're not getting [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=126.18s)]
*  accurate information. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=128.26s)]
*  If you think there's no MAGA split [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=129.9s)]
*  in the country, you're a little [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=131.7s)]
*  cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=133.34s)]
*  So hold on, hold on, I wouldn't say [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=134.74s)]
*  they're not getting accurate [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=135.94s)]
*  information. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=137.14000000000001s)]
*  I trust that Crystal and [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=137.82s)]
*  Kyle are giving accurate [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=138.86s)]
*  information. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=139.9s)]
*  I just mean in general. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=140.46s)]
*  Hold on, but what I think is an [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=141.46s)]
*  issue, and I was guilty of this, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=143.26s)]
*  this was an issue that I had in [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=145.4s)]
*  the way that I was covering stories [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=147.18s)]
*  some years ago. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=149.24s)]
*  It's that you end up in a bubble [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=151.36s)]
*  and you don't even realize it, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=152.88s)]
*  right? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=154.38s)]
*  That's definitely right. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=155.0s)]
*  And when you're in that bubble, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=155.72s)]
*  there's certain information that's [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=157.1s)]
*  not getting to you. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=158.84s)]
*  You have to literally actively seek [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=159.76s)]
*  it out because of these algorithms [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=161.88s)]
*  serving up what the algorithm [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=164.0s)]
*  thinks you want to know or [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=165.84s)]
*  thinks you want to see. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=167.3s)]
*  And so it doesn't mean that you [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=169.04s)]
*  have to agree with everything that [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=170.8s)]
*  Candace Owens believes in, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=172.88s)]
*  obviously we don't. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=174.60000000000002s)]
*  But that interview was fire. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=176.52s)]
*  Everything she said in that [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=178.52s)]
*  interview was correct. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=179.8s)]
*  And if you can't give her credit [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=180.8s)]
*  for saying things that we on [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=182.48000000000002s)]
*  the left believe, you really have [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=183.92000000000002s)]
*  to ask yourself, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=185.8s)]
*  how are you operating? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=186.76000000000002s)]
*  Are you operating based on [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=188.16000000000003s)]
*  supporting a specific tribe [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=190.04000000000002s)]
*  no matter what? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=192.0s)]
*  Yes, that's definitely what [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=193.24s)]
*  they're doing. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=194.24s)]
*  And if you do that, well, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=194.76000000000002s)]
*  then you're not driven by policy. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=195.88000000000002s)]
*  You're not driven by actually [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=197.32000000000002s)]
*  accomplishing the policies that we [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=198.72000000000003s)]
*  think will make the country better. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=200.16000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, look, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=201.72000000000003s)]
*  it's not about Kyle and [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=202.32000000000002s)]
*  Crystal at all. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=203.32000000000002s)]
*  I mean, oftentimes, I think [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=204.06s)]
*  sometimes these days, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=205.82s)]
*  it used to be oftentimes, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=207.34s)]
*  they're usually among [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=208.82s)]
*  the more reasonable. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=210.06s)]
*  But these days, if you're on the [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=211.14s)]
*  left and you're watching any of the [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=213.34s)]
*  other shows, you're not getting [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=215.73999999999998s)]
*  accurate information at all. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=218.07999999999998s)]
*  They're telling you that every, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=220.29999999999998s)]
*  the actual Trump voters are liars [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=222.18s)]
*  and they love war. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=224.1s)]
*  That's not true at all, right? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=225.85999999999999s)]
*  So some of the Trump voters will do [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=227.42s)]
*  whatever Trump wants, but [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=229.45999999999998s)]
*  a lot of them are actually into [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=231.06s)]
*  war. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=232.8s)]
*  And they're making it seem like [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=233.64000000000001s)]
*  almost all the other left wing [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=235.24s)]
*  shows as if the most extreme [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=236.6s)]
*  Magagai represents all 77 million [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=238.14000000000001s)]
*  Trump voters. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=240.28s)]
*  And if you believe that, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=242.08s)]
*  then you'll hate them. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=243.16s)]
*  Of course, you'll want to call [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=244.08s)]
*  them fascists and racists and [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=245.5s)]
*  Nazis and all those things. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=246.84s)]
*  But that's maniacal. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=248.72s)]
*  No, as you get closer to [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=251.56s)]
*  the middle, there's a lot of former [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=253.16s)]
*  Obama voters, former Bernie voters, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=255.6s)]
*  anti-war voters, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=258.16s)]
*  anti-establishment voters. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=259.4s)]
*  And almost none of the other left [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=261.5s)]
*  wing shows are acknowledging that. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=262.86s)]
*  They're out in la la land. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=264.18s)]
*  And honestly, yes, most of [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=265.70000000000005s)]
*  the other left wing shows are [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=267.26s)]
*  totally lying to their audience. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=268.84000000000003s)]
*  And they're saying no, no, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=270.90000000000003s)]
*  no, there's no split. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=272.06s)]
*  They all will do whatever Trump [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=273.34000000000003s)]
*  wants. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=274.86s)]
*  They're all the same voter. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=275.38s)]
*  They're all hardcore Maga and [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=276.90000000000003s)]
*  they're all fascist. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=278.3s)]
*  And by the way, as Kyle pointed at [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=279.42s)]
*  me and said, yes or no, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=281.5s)]
*  it's Maga fascist. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=283.02000000000004s)]
*  Well, what an asinine question. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=284.3s)]
*  What do you mean by Maga? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=287.42s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=288.54s)]
*  And do you mean Trump voters? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=289.42s)]
*  Because no, not all Trump voters [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=290.64s)]
*  are fascist. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=292.28000000000003s)]
*  But if you say that on another [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=293.04s)]
*  left wing show, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=294.28000000000003s)]
*  they'll lose their minds. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=295.04s)]
*  They'll say no, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=296.72s)]
*  you have to call them fascists. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=297.4s)]
*  I'm the purest, I'm the purest, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=298.84000000000003s)]
*  I'm the most left. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=300.16s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=301.28000000000003s)]
*  Give me clicks, give me clicks. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=301.8s)]
*  I'm not interested in getting into [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=303.84000000000003s)]
*  the business of other shows and [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=305.8s)]
*  how they conduct business. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=307.46s)]
*  You do you boo, right? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=309.28000000000003s)]
*  But look, I just think that there [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=310.44s)]
*  is an interesting dynamic at play [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=313.2s)]
*  when breaking points, for instance, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=315.76s)]
*  which I love, I listen to and [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=319.21999999999997s)]
*  watch breaking points almost on [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=321.02s)]
*  a daily basis at this point. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=322.92s)]
*  Crystal knows better than anyone, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=325.5s)]
*  Sagar and [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=327.82s)]
*  Jetti is very critical of going to [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=328.46s)]
*  war in Iran, very critical. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=330.52s)]
*  He's not a left winger. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=333.26s)]
*  How could you possibly say there [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=333.94s)]
*  was an split? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=335.5s)]
*  How could you possibly say that? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=336.78s)]
*  And what they'll do, I swear to God [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=338.62s)]
*  and I know it, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=340.09999999999997s)]
*  they'll move the goalposts. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=340.65999999999997s)]
*  So look, you can look at it. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=342.58s)]
*  We put the interview up on [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=344.26s)]
*  tyt.com. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=345.34s)]
*  And as you watch it, I just want to [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=345.86s)]
*  notice what happens, right? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=348.40000000000003s)]
*  I say I don't agree with Trump and [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=352.04s)]
*  I say, but I think we can get some [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=353.68s)]
*  of the Trump voters. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=355.40000000000003s)]
*  Honestly, they're not listening at [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=357.68s)]
*  all, then they just go back to, so [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=359.48s)]
*  here's what's wrong with Trump. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=361.16s)]
*  And I'm like, yeah, I agree, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=362.92s)]
*  that's what's wrong with Trump. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=364.32s)]
*  So let's talk about how to get [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=366.52s)]
*  the voters in the middle. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=367.44s)]
*  They're like, okay, now, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=368.40000000000003s)]
*  here's what's wrong with Trump. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=369.64s)]
*  So I get frustrated. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=371.0s)]
*  I'm like, wait, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=372.96000000000004s)]
*  are we having the same conversation [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=373.76s)]
*  here? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=375.6s)]
*  And so part of that is framing it [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=376.5s)]
*  as we're tougher and [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=378.70000000000005s)]
*  meaner on Trump voters. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=380.06s)]
*  We got them, right? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=381.90000000000003s)]
*  Cenk, look at him being soft on [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=383.82s)]
*  Trump voters. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=385.86s)]
*  That's not a real leftist. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=387.14000000000004s)]
*  And as Kyle said, look, man, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=389.66s)]
*  I don't catch- [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=391.22s)]
*  Well, I mean, you're not [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=391.86s)]
*  a leftist, number one. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=392.74s)]
*  Yeah, right, but I'm on the left. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=393.70000000000005s)]
*  I'm massively on the left, right? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=396.86s)]
*  And leftists don't represent [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=398.98s)]
*  the majority of the left. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=400.70000000000005s)]
*  I mean, whatever words we use, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=402.34000000000003s)]
*  right, radical left, whatever. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=403.90000000000003s)]
*  They're a small sliver, right? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=405.35999999999996s)]
*  But they always make it seem like [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=407.88s)]
*  we're the true left. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=409.56s)]
*  Well, the polling doesn't indicate [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=410.79999999999995s)]
*  that at all, at all, okay? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=412.88s)]
*  So Kyle was like, yeah, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=414.76s)]
*  you're coddling them and [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=416.52s)]
*  he used some profane language, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=418.0s)]
*  etc. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=419.85999999999996s)]
*  I'm okay, I'm a grown up, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=420.4s)]
*  that's fine, I don't care, right? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=421.91999999999996s)]
*  But by the way, if I said that to [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=424.47999999999996s)]
*  Kyle and I said, you know what? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=426.52s)]
*  By helping Trump and [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=428.67999999999995s)]

*  away their voters, driving away [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=432.23999999999995s)]
*  the voters that are anti-war, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=434.41999999999996s)]
*  anti-establishment in the middle, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=436.02s)]
*  you're coddling their balls, Kyle. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=437.85999999999996s)]
*  Well, hey, it's okay, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=439.9s)]
*  we're all adults here, right? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=440.84s)]

*  But if I said that to him in [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=443.34s)]
*  the middle, I bet you he would have [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=444.29999999999995s)]
*  been super mad. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=445.53999999999996s)]
*  Is that how you coddle balls? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=446.58s)]
*  I don't know, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=448.09999999999997s)]
*  I think he did it that way. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=448.82s)]
*  I don't have enough experience [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=450.58s)]
*  with it, Kyle seemed to demonstrate [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=452.17999999999995s)]
*  it pretty accurate, I guess. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=454.02s)]
*  Anyway, seriously, guys, look, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=455.78s)]
*  it is what it is. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=457.17999999999995s)]
*  We have differences of opinion [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=457.85999999999996s)]
*  these days. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=459.26s)]
*  I'm not saying cancel them, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=459.97999999999996s)]
*  don't watch them. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=461.78s)]
*  I mean, Ana just told you she [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=462.96s)]
*  watches Breaking Points, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=464.32s)]
*  I go on Breaking Points, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=465.52s)]
*  I have these conversations. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=466.68s)]
*  I'm trying to have conversations [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=469.32s)]
*  where we discuss what is the best [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=471.68s)]
*  strategy to take power away from [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=474.16s)]
*  Trump and bring those [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=476.64s)]
*  anti-establishment, anti-war, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=478.24s)]
*  anti-corruption voters to our side. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=480.8s)]
*  And by our side, I don't mean [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=484.48s)]
*  establishment Democrat. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=485.48s)]
*  If you're going to go in that [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=486.48s)]
*  direction, they're never going to [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=487.24s)]
*  say yes. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=488.0s)]
*  And by the way, I also don't mean [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=488.88s)]
*  radical left, because if you go in [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=489.88s)]
*  that direction, they're never [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=491.2s)]
*  going to say yes. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=492.34s)]
*  But if you go populist left, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=493.86s)]
*  Corburny, economic populism, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=495.58s)]
*  they will say yes. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=497.84s)]
*  So please, it's not about watch [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=499.54s)]
*  this show or that show, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=501.34s)]
*  watch all the shows, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=502.58s)]
*  get all of the opinions, okay? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=503.54s)]
*  Make sure you're getting the facts. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=505.7s)]
*  And at the end of the day, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=507.58s)]
*  think through, okay, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=508.98s)]
*  it's easy for me to get tribal and [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=510.38s)]
*  say, I hate those guys. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=512.58s)]
*  That's an easy thing. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=514.3s)]
*  And by the way, Kyle said, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=516.34s)]
*  you used to do that, and some of [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=517.38s)]
*  you guys wrote in yesterday and [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=518.66s)]
*  stuff. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=519.98s)]
*  Yeah, first of all, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=520.78s)]
*  I do it to their politicians all [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=521.72s)]
*  the time. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=522.96s)]
*  You fight up, you look up, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=523.5200000000001s)]
*  you fight the politicians, okay? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=524.96s)]
*  That's the difference. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=526.84s)]
*  I want to emphasize that. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=527.8000000000001s)]
*  I want to say it again, because [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=530.2800000000001s)]
*  people keep conflating the [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=531.96s)]
*  politicians with the voters. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=533.48s)]
*  I'm not interested in attacking [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=535.6400000000001s)]
*  voters. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=536.88s)]
*  I am interested in attacking [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=537.4000000000001s)]
*  the politicians. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=538.88s)]
*  Bingo. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=539.96s)]
*  And by the way, and look, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=540.6400000000001s)]
*  Chris and Kyle are pretty good on [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=541.72s)]
*  this, not some of the other shows, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=543.2800000000001s)]
*  but also holding the Democrats [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=544.88s)]
*  accountable, right? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=546.48s)]
*  Exactly, yeah. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=547.76s)]
*  Because if you don't hold [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=548.2800000000001s)]
*  the Democrats accountable, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=549.08s)]
*  you got no credibility. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=549.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, the Republicans are terrible [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=551.26s)]
*  and they're all the devil. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=552.5s)]
*  But the Democrats and [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=553.5799999999999s)]
*  Kamala Harris run perfect campaigns [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=554.4599999999999s)]
*  and Joe Biden's a saint. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=556.02s)]
*  You gotta be kidding me, no way. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=557.3s)]
*  But luckily, most people have [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=559.06s)]
*  moved on past that, right? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=559.9799999999999s)]
*  And they were never in that camp [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=561.0999999999999s)]
*  in the first place. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=562.14s)]
*  So look, look around, watch [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=563.26s)]
*  everything, and then see what do [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=565.26s)]
*  you think is the better strategy? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=567.42s)]
*  And Kyle said that the better [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=569.54s)]
*  strategy and repeated online [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=571.18s)]
*  throughout is, we're going to win [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=572.8199999999999s)]
*  the left and liberals, and [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=574.66s)]
*  then win the left. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=576.06s)]
*  But that's what we've been trying [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=577.3399999999999s)]
*  to do, and we just lost twice to [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=579.24s)]
*  Trump doing that same exact [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=580.96s)]
*  strategy. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=582.6s)]
*  You have to win the anti-establishment [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=583.48s)]
*  voters. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=586.08s)]
*  You do that through populist left. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=587.12s)]
*  I don't even think Kyle and [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=589.48s)]
*  Chris will disagree with that. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=590.52s)]
*  I don't know if some of the [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=592.24s)]
*  radicals or the establishment, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=593.28s)]
*  the establishment guys will [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=594.64s)]
*  certainly disagree. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=595.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=596.6800000000001s)]
*  Maybe some of the radicals will [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=597.1800000000001s)]
*  disagree because you can't ever [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=598.64s)]
*  agree with anyone on the other [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=600.28s)]
*  side about anything, right? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=601.84s)]
*  But overall, please use your mind. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=604.28s)]
*  Please, by that I don't mean it [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=606.52s)]
*  like in a derogatory way. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=608.14s)]
*  Use your own independent [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=609.7s)]
*  judgment. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=610.78s)]
*  Don't take my word for it. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=611.42s)]
*  Don't take Kyle's word for it. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=612.54s)]
*  Don't take Randall's word for it, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=613.7s)]
*  okay? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=615.26s)]
*  Think through what is the best [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=615.98s)]
*  strategy? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=617.46s)]
*  Is the best strategy to call the [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=618.26s)]
*  other voters fascists and [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=620.02s)]
*  drive them away? [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=621.46s)]
*  Or is the better strategy say, hey, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=623.02s)]
*  if you actually do agree with us, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=624.7s)]
*  we're not going towards you. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=626.26s)]
*  They're coming towards us. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=627.46s)]
*  Anti-establishment, anti-war, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=629.02s)]
*  anti-corruption, then great, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=631.02s)]
*  you're welcome. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=632.78s)]
*  Welcome to come here. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=633.7s)]
*  And I say that about [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=635.34s)]
*  the Young Turks. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=636.02s)]
*  Yeah, if you're an independent [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=637.04s)]
*  voter, and you believe in populism, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=638.3199999999999s)]
*  and you actually meant all those [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=639.96s)]
*  things, you are definitely welcome [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=641.4s)]
*  here. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=643.16s)]
*  And go ask the other [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=644.12s)]
*  left-wing shows, are they welcome? [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=644.88s)]
*  Now that I've stated it this way, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=647.16s)]
*  they'll seem like jackasses if they [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=648.4399999999999s)]
*  say they're not. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=649.88s)]
*  So they might pretend that they [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=650.76s)]
*  are, but every single day, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=652.4399999999999s)]
*  they're like, fascists, go away. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=653.96s)]
*  Go away, fascists. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=655.92s)]
*  Don't vote left. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=656.88s)]
*  Don't support the left. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=657.76s)]
*  Well, if you do that, yeah, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=659.04s)]
*  they're not going to support [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=660.0799999999999s)]
*  the left. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=661.16s)]
*  They're going to go away, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=661.68s)]
*  just like you told them to. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=662.52s)]
*  One of the things that Candace [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=663.3199999999999s)]
*  Owens said today, and look, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=664.72s)]
*  it takes balls to say this. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=667.0600000000001s)]
*  I don't think I have the balls to [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=668.74s)]
*  say it, but she literally said, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=669.98s)]
*  no, I don't want regime change. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=671.62s)]
*  I think we should have a talk about [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=673.4200000000001s)]
*  regime change in Israel. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=675.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=678.22s)]
*  And then she talked about how she [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=678.9000000000001s)]
*  believes that Israel has carried [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=680.94s)]
*  out more terroristic acts than [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=683.0s)]
*  Iran has. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=684.7800000000001s)]
*  Which, look, yeah, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=686.0200000000001s)]
*  that was strong. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=687.38s)]
*  But my point is, she is willing to [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=688.6600000000001s)]
*  look at the broader picture, right? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=690.86s)]
*  Not just what's happening at this [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=694.22s)]
*  moment, but what has happened [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=695.6s)]
*  historically with the formation of [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=697.24s)]
*  Israel, the wars that have been [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=699.36s)]
*  fought on behalf of Israel. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=701.4000000000001s)]
*  And she's calling it like she's [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=703.4000000000001s)]
*  seeing it. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=705.5600000000001s)]
*  And so, if there is a contingent of [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=706.32s)]
*  Trump voters, and she did vote for [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=708.76s)]
*  Trump, and now she's speaking out [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=711.24s)]
*  against him because of what [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=713.64s)]
*  happened in Iran with the bombing [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=715.44s)]
*  of the nuclear sites and all that. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=717.5s)]
*  If there's a contingent on the [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=719.6400000000001s)]
*  right that consists of this anti-war [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=721.44s)]
*  strategy on the topic of preventing [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=723.74s)]
*  wars, I will work with them. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=726.6600000000001s)]
*  I will work with them, period. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=728.94s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=732.7s)]
*  I don't care if they're right [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=733.4200000000001s)]
*  wingers, if they are legitimate in [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=734.98s)]
*  being anti-war, not wanting to [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=736.98s)]
*  engage in regime change on that [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=738.72s)]
*  specific issue, yes, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=740.5s)]
*  I will work with them. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=741.82s)]
*  You want to know why? [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=743.1s)]
*  Because preventing war, to me, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=744.9s)]
*  is more important than being pure [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=746.82s)]
*  to the left. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=748.78s)]
*  I don't care about the left. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=750.14s)]
*  I don't care about the right. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=751.5s)]
*  I care about results. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=752.76s)]
*  And I'm sorry, this false dichotomy, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=754.0s)]
*  this BS tribalism has only hurt [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=756.88s)]
*  the country on areas where we can [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=759.28s)]
*  work together, we should work [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=761.58s)]
*  together. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=763.58s)]
*  And I do think that there's [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=764.12s)]
*  a contingent on the right, voters, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=765.48s)]
*  and yes, a few media folks who are [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=767.44s)]
*  sick of the regime change wars. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=769.24s)]
*  They're sick of the forever wars, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=771.72s)]
*  and they're not full of crap, okay? [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=773.32s)]
*  Because they literally say things [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=774.92s)]
*  publicly that could ruin them, but [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=776.64s)]
*  they say it anyway. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=778.4s)]
*  Yeah, so look, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=779.76s)]
*  last couple things here. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=780.48s)]
*  So on that interview, there was [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=782.1s)]
*  times where Candace went too far. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=783.86s)]
*  Yes, supporting Kanye West and [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=786.46s)]
*  all that nasty stuff. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=787.86s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't even get to that [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=789.0200000000001s)]
*  part, no, that's a disaster. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=790.22s)]
*  And even when she says, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=792.0200000000001s)]
*  I want regime change in Israel, and [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=793.26s)]
*  Piers says, yeah, I mean, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=794.9000000000001s)]
*  we should get rid of Netanyahu, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=796.1s)]
*  also good so far. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=797.64s)]
*  And then she later talked about [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=798.82s)]
*  using the military in the context [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=800.58s)]
*  of Israel, and I'm like, okay, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=802.5200000000001s)]
*  bring it down, okay? [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=804.3000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=805.5400000000001s)]
*  Okay, so now having said that, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=806.3000000000001s)]
*  she's saying some of the things [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=808.3000000000001s)]
*  that we on the left, me, Amy [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=810.3199999999999s)]
*  Goodman, Bernie Sanders have been [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=811.9599999999999s)]
*  saying for 20 years, but [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=813.9599999999999s)]
*  we couldn't get anybody to pay [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=815.3599999999999s)]
*  attention, and this sucks about [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=816.8399999999999s)]
*  American media. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=818.4399999999999s)]
*  It's super toxic about American [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=819.16s)]
*  media, but it's true. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=821.16s)]
*  If you say it on the left, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=823.04s)]
*  they're never going to pay [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=824.04s)]
*  attention. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=825.0799999999999s)]
*  The minute anyone on the right [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=825.76s)]
*  says, they're like, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=827.24s)]
*  that's such an interesting point. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=828.28s)]
*  You know what? [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=830.8399999999999s)]
*  And we'll talk about it later in [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=831.8399999999999s)]
*  the show, Tom Massey, Candace Owens, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=833.0799999999999s)]
*  when they say, hey, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=834.8399999999999s)]
*  what has Israel done for us? [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=835.88s)]
*  Like, if you ask that, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=838.3599999999999s)]
*  we've been asking that question for [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=839.38s)]
*  20 years on the left, and [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=840.62s)]
*  nobody paid attention. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=841.58s)]
*  The minute those two asked [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=842.42s)]
*  the question, the American media's [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=843.58s)]
*  like, wait a minute, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=845.3000000000001s)]
*  that is a provocative question. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=846.46s)]
*  What has Israel done for us, right? [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=848.9s)]
*  And the answer is zero, nothing, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=851.34s)]
*  nothing. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=852.9s)]
*  They've taken, taken, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=853.42s)]
*  started wars, etc. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=854.62s)]
*  So, okay, guys, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=856.0600000000001s)]
*  this is last thing here, simple [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=857.46s)]
*  concept, but it hasn't been treated [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=859.78s)]
*  as a simple concept. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=862.3000000000001s)]
*  You can agree with some things and [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=863.94s)]
*  disagree with other things about [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=866.54s)]
*  a person. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=869.24s)]
*  And I'm saying it like I'm almost [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=869.92s)]
*  being patronizing, right? [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=871.72s)]
*  I get it, but that's because so [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=873.52s)]
*  many people say back, no, you can't. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=875.38s)]
*  You either have to be 100% for [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=878.24s)]
*  Trump or 100% against Trump. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=879.98s)]
*  Same thing for Candace Owens, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=882.4399999999999s)]
*  Tucker Carlson, etc. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=883.72s)]
*  If you even give them credit on [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=885.16s)]
*  a thing where they're agreeing with [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=886.84s)]
*  you, no, that's toxic, terrible, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=888.8s)]
*  normalizes, blah, blah, blah. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=890.92s)]
*  They make up a bunch of words. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=893.48s)]
*  So you're legitimizing, [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=895.12s)]
*  platforming. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=896.12s)]
*  There's no normalizing, okay? [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=896.6999999999999s)]
*  Candace Owens, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=898.02s)]
*  it has been normalized, okay? [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=899.0999999999999s)]
*  She has a massive audience, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=901.3s)]
*  massive platform. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=903.0999999999999s)]

*  She's wildly popular. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=908.8199999999999s)]
*  No, it goes to a super arrogant [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=910.6999999999999s)]
*  sense of entitlement that I think [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=912.5s)]
*  actually comes more from [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=914.18s)]
*  the establishment Democrats. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=915.4s)]

*  Kamala shouldn't go on. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=922.54s)]
*  It would normalize, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=923.62s)]

*  Kamala Harris, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=931.88s)]

*  Yeah, that's why no one [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=943.4399999999999s)]

*  And that's another thing I was [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=948.88s)]
*  surprised by. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=950.0799999999999s)]
*  I thought that they would see [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=950.64s)]
*  the bro shows are an open rebellion, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=952.36s)]
*  right? [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=954.68s)]
*  Rogan again today, beating up Trump [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=955.38s)]
*  on immigration, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=957.58s)]
*  not even the wars, right? [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=958.52s)]
*  Tim Dillon, Theo Vaughn, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=960.1s)]
*  massively beating up Israel and [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=961.54s)]
*  saying what are they doing for us [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=963.26s)]
*  and get out of the wars and so on. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=964.98s)]
*  I'm like, and they're like, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=966.82s)]
*  nope, I don't see it. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=968.0600000000001s)]
*  And they said that Rogan was like, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=968.86s)]
*  I don't know, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=970.54s)]
*  I don't want to paraphrase. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=971.1800000000001s)]
*  You can watch the interview for [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=972.5s)]
*  yourself tyt.com slash press. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=974.54s)]
*  But he put Rogan in the same batch [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=976.66s)]
*  as Maga, I believe. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=978.82s)]
*  I'm like, no, no, no, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=980.26s)]
*  Rogan has a whole bunch of right [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=981.86s)]
*  doing positions I don't agree with. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=984.0s)]
*  But he's not Maga. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=986.08s)]
*  That's a different category. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=987.64s)]
*  He's in the brosphere. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=989.16s)]
*  They're more independent. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=990.5600000000001s)]
*  They're not in that same category. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=991.6800000000001s)]
*  They agree there's a lot of [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=995.16s)]
*  overlap, right? [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=996.4s)]
*  But on war and even on immigration, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=997.64s)]
*  he's like, why are they kidnapping [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=999.5600000000001s)]
*  people off the streets in the [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1001.24s)]
*  middle of the country, right? [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1002.5600000000001s)]
*  He's actually been good on [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1003.8000000000001s)]
*  the topic of immigration. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1005.08s)]
*  I remember Rogan got a lot of [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1006.4s)]
*  backlash in Trump's first term. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1008.44s)]
*  Because he hated Trump's immigration [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1011.12s)]
*  policies and spoke out against it. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1013.3s)]
*  So look, I think Americans are a lot [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1015.1s)]
*  more complicated and [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1017.74s)]
*  complex than all left or all right. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1019.38s)]
*  I think most people are a mix of [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1022.1s)]
*  some conservative views, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1024.3s)]
*  some liberal views, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1026.26s)]
*  some far left views, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1027.7s)]
*  some far right views. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1029.22s)]
*  It's a mix. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1030.78s)]
*  Ordinary people are a hodgepodge of [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1031.74s)]
*  political views. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1033.86s)]
*  And so I think the issue that I [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1035.1s)]
*  have in general is this effort or [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1037.26s)]
*  this obsession to impugn people's [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1039.58s)]
*  character based on their views on [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1042.0s)]
*  one issue or their opinion on one [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1044.56s)]
*  issue or the other. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1047.1200000000001s)]
*  Or which side they're on. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1048.8s)]
*  Or which side they're on, yeah. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1050.92s)]
*  It's just pure, pure tribalism. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1052.1200000000001s)]
*  It's like tribalism crack. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1054.24s)]
*  So you know you're on tribalism [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1056.24s)]
*  crack when the other side comes to [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1058.28s)]
*  you and you reject them. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1060.48s)]
*  We're not going to them. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1063.28s)]
*  They're like, you're doing [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1064.56s)]
*  the strategy Kamala Harris and [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1065.52s)]
*  Joe Biden did where they try to get [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1066.68s)]
*  Republicans in the suburbs. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1068.04s)]
*  No, they did that strategy by [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1069.84s)]
*  wrapping their arms around Dick [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1071.24s)]
*  Cheney, Liz Cheney and [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1072.84s)]
*  conservative corporatist positions. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1074.14s)]
*  That's a terrible strategy. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1076.78s)]
*  No, but when the other side comes [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1080.38s)]
*  to you and goes, you're right, [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1081.74s)]
*  we're anti-war, you're right, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1082.9s)]
*  we like the idea of anti-corruption. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1084.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you could say, hey, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1085.94s)]
*  you picked the wrong guy for [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1086.94s)]
*  that, Donald Trump. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1087.94s)]
*  But the right guy is Bernie [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1089.02s)]
*  Sanders and others. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1090.08s)]
*  You could have that conversation [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1090.98s)]
*  like grownups and like human beings. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1092.42s)]
*  Or you could do what a lot of [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1094.54s)]
*  the other left is doing. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1095.78s)]
*  Fascist, wrong tribe, I hate you. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1097.02s)]
*  Right? [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1101.08s)]
*  Well, then that brother isn't going [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1101.82s)]
*  to have a conversation with you. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1103.1799999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1104.52s)]
*  And he's not going to come to your [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1105.02s)]
*  side. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1106.44s)]
*  Again, I find it so obvious, but [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1106.96s)]
*  yet there is a real massive school [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1109.8799999999999s)]
*  of thought that says, no, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1112.8s)]
*  don't try to get those voters to [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1114.96s)]
*  come to your side. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1117.28s)]
*  Call them evil and shun them. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1118.44s)]
*  And shun Rogan when he agrees with [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1121.8s)]
*  you, shun Candace Owens, [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1123.48s)]
*  shun Tucker, shun all of them. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1124.8799999999999s)]
*  Even when they take positions that [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1127.48s)]
*  are textbook, [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1129.54s)]
*  left-wing anti-war positions, right? [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1130.3799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1132.78s)]
*  Look, guys- And that's just, [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1133.28s)]
*  to me that's mental. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1134.58s)]
*  But if you think that makes sense, [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1135.58s)]
*  okay, good, there's tons of [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1137.26s)]
*  left-wing shows that are doing that. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1138.46s)]
*  You'll be thrilled. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1140.1s)]
*  You'll go on there and [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1141.1399999999999s)]
*  they'll just, they agreed with us. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1141.86s)]
*  They're liars. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1144.26s)]
*  They're fascists. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1145.62s)]
*  Ha ha, we drive them away. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1146.74s)]
*  We drive all their voters away. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1148.94s)]
*  My God, there's like dozens of [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1150.62s)]
*  shows like that. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1151.82s)]
*  So you'll enjoy that. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1152.82s)]
*  So look, the final thing I'll say [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1153.42s)]
*  is, I became politicized in the lead [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1155.02s)]
*  up to the preemptive warning, [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1157.18s)]
*  the preemptive war in Iraq. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1158.8799999999999s)]
*  And at that time, and for [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1160.52s)]
*  a long time after that, [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1162.32s)]
*  every single Republican, [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1164.1999999999998s)]
*  every single Republican, [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1166.26s)]
*  we're talking about voters, members [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1168.12s)]
*  of the media and the politicians, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1170.4399999999998s)]
*  were neocons. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1172.54s)]
*  Every single one of them, [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1173.6799999999998s)]
*  there wasn't an anti-war [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1175.26s)]
*  conservative to be found. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1176.6399999999999s)]
*  And it brings tears to my eyes that [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1178.32s)]
*  today that has changed. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1180.84s)]
*  That is a good thing. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1182.6799999999998s)]
*  Because we have to end this [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1184.28s)]
*  paradigm. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1185.8999999999999s)]
*  It is crushing our country, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1186.4799999999998s)]
*  and so look, if you think I'm a bad [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1188.54s)]
*  person, if you think Cenk's a bad [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1190.54s)]
*  person for being willing to work [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1192.44s)]
*  with anyone on the right who agrees [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1194.28s)]
*  with our anti-war stance, [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1196.18s)]
*  then you can go ahead and [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1197.58s)]
*  think we're bad people. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1198.8999999999999s)]
*  I really don't give a damn. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1200.06s)]
*  Yeah, I care. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1201.22s)]
*  Because I want to see results. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1201.74s)]
*  I want to see change, and [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1203.18s)]
*  you're not going to get it by [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1204.5s)]
*  living and dying in an echo [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1205.94s)]
*  chamber. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1207.3s)]
*  Because of that, I'm forced to say [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1208.02s)]
*  one super last thing, guys. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1209.54s)]
*  Of course. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1210.82s)]
*  Of course. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1211.34s)]
*  So guys, I covered the Iraq war. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1211.86s)]
*  Young Turks was on the air in 2002 [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1214.74s)]
*  in the lead up to the Iraq war. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1216.6s)]
*  And so that was Ben Manquist and [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1218.6s)]
*  I back then. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1220.24s)]
*  And we were one of only two national [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1220.8s)]
*  shows against Iraq war. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1223.12s)]
*  The other one was by the legend, [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1225.1999999999998s)]
*  Amy Goodman. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1227.28s)]
*  So Democracy Now and [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1228.72s)]
*  the Young Turks going, no, [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1229.76s)]
*  don't go in, don't go in. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1231.28s)]
*  And they were doing the same exact [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1232.76s)]
*  playbook as they are on Iran now, [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1234.4399999999998s)]
*  right? [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1236.12s)]
*  Now here we are, we both survivors, [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1236.72s)]
*  lone survivors of original digital [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1238.72s)]
*  media, right? [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1240.72s)]
*  And now we're both against [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1242.52s)]
*  the Iran war. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1243.84s)]
*  And tip of the hat to Amy Goodman, [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1244.94s)]
*  total legend. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1246.6200000000001s)]
*  We appreciate you, sister, okay? [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1247.5s)]
*  Still going strong by it. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1249.38s)]
*  Yeah, and so now that is why what [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1250.26s)]
*  Ana said, if you didn't live [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1253.1000000000001s)]
*  through it, you don't know it. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1255.54s)]
*  I was tearing my hair out in [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1258.66s)]
*  the lead up to the Iraq war. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1260.3400000000001s)]
*  They didn't attack us. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1262.22s)]
*  They didn't attack us, it's a lie. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1263.94s)]
*  And the weapons of mass destruction, [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1266.26s)]
*  that's not even true. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1267.7s)]
*  And we're not going to be greeted [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1268.8200000000002s)]
*  as liberators, it's crazy, right? [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1270.5s)]
*  And at the time, [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1273.22s)]
*  there wasn't a single Republican [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1274.2s)]
*  you could find. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1275.76s)]
*  Every Republican was pro-war. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1277.0800000000002s)]
*  Correct. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1278.8s)]
*  And anytime you say, you saw your [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1279.3s)]
*  best friend Saddam Hussein? [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1280.92s)]
*  Support the troops. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1282.5600000000002s)]
*  That's what everyone on the right [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1283.8400000000001s)]
*  would say. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1285.6000000000001s)]
*  And almost everyone in the middle [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1286.28s)]
*  because of so much brainwashing by [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1287.68s)]
*  mainstream media, right? [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1289.24s)]
*  Now we have allies on the right, [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1290.92s)]
*  and it's unbelievable. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1293.4s)]
*  It's a great thing that they're [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1295.5600000000002s)]
*  allies. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1298.0800000000002s)]
*  And even in this preposterous [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1299.1200000000001s)]
*  fantasy land thinking that they're [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1301.04s)]
*  flying in unison, who cares? [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1303.3s)]
*  because they're telling their [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1306.1399999999999s)]
*  viewers to be anti-war. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1308.06s)]
*  They're telling their viewers, [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1310.26s)]
*  be careful about Israel driving [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1311.74s)]
*  this agenda like they did it in [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1313.18s)]
*  the Iraq war. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1314.5s)]
*  So all of those viewers and [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1316.02s)]
*  voters are getting that message. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1317.62s)]
*  And now we have allies and [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1319.78s)]
*  tons of people on our side are [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1321.42s)]
*  trying to drive those allies away. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1323.46s)]
*  Having fought with no allies at all [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1326.62s)]
*  against Iraq war, trust me, [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1328.62s)]
*  you're in infinitely better shape [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1330.54s)]
*  with allies. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1332.6s)]
*  And then they'll say, yeah, but [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1333.52s)]
*  what good does it do? [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1335.28s)]
*  Well, without allies, [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1337.3999999999999s)]
*  without Maggie pushing back, [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1338.72s)]
*  would Donald Trump have been as [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1340.4399999999998s)]
*  clear about Israel, you're going to [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1342.28s)]
*  do the ceasefire, you're going to [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1344.3999999999999s)]
*  bring your planes back? [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1346.3999999999999s)]
*  Maybe he would have, and [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1348.12s)]
*  maybe he wouldn't have. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1349.4399999999998s)]
*  And would he have been, remember [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1351.36s)]
*  when he first said we're going to [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1352.8799999999999s)]
*  put ground troops into Gaza, [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1354.28s)]
*  Maggie pushed back ferociously, and [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1355.6799999999998s)]
*  he reversed it in 24 hours? [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1357.48s)]
*  Again, if you watch those shows, [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1359.52s)]
*  you don't know that probably. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1360.84s)]
*  because they don't tell you when [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1362.3799999999999s)]
*  it works, right? [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1364.58s)]
*  So I do know having half of MAGA [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1366.1399999999999s)]
*  push back against this or half of [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1368.6599999999999s)]
*  Trump's voters overall push back [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1371.1399999999999s)]
*  against this is definitely at least [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1373.6399999999999s)]
*  a little helpful so that we get to [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1376.26s)]
*  a moderation and don't bring [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1378.58s)]

*  And at the very least guys, [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1385.62s)]
*  get caught trying, trying to build [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1387.4199999999998s)]
*  an alliance to stop a war because [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PSHKD_xEc&t=1389.74s)]
