"TEL AVIV ‚Äî Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was abruptly summoned from his ongoing corruption trial to provide testimony in a separate case Monday afternoon after two of his aides were arrested amid mounting allegations of financial ties between Netanyahu‚Äôs office and Qatar, a country with which Israel has no formal ties and which maintains relations with Hamas."

# State Dept Spokesperson GASLIGHTS Reporters After Israel Kills Paramedics
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [April 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU)
*  The UN's humanitarian affairs office has said that 15 paramedics, civil defense and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=0.0s)]
*  a UN worker were killed, in their words, one by one by the IDF. They have dug bodies up, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  they said, in the shallow grave that have been gathered up. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=14.24s)]
*  I can tell you that for too long, Hamas has abused civilian infrastructure, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=17.28s)]
*  cynically using it to shield themselves. Hamas's actions have caused humanitarians to be caught [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=24.16s)]
*  in the crossfire. At what point are people gonna get sick and tired of that lame excuse [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=29.2s)]
*  of Hamas was using them as human shields? Now that was State Department spokesperson, Tammy Bruce, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=36.8s)]
*  immediately deflecting when asked about the 15 dead Palestinian paramedics [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=42.96s)]
*  that were found in a shallow mass grave. And when Bruce was pressed on her answer, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=49.92s)]
*  she doubled down even more. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=56.559999999999995s)]
*  But this is specifically a question on any, it's a question about accounting and accountability, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=57.839999999999996s)]
*  given that may have been the use of US weapons. So it's a question about the State Department [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=65.03999999999999s)]
*  rather than Hamas. Is there any action? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=69.03999999999999s)]
*  Well, every single thing that is happening in Gaza is happening because of Hamas. Every [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=72.39999999999999s)]
*  single dynamic. I'll say again, I've said it, I think in every briefing. All of this could stop [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=79.67999999999999s)]
*  in a moment if Hamas returned all the hostages and the hostage bodies they are still holding [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=86.16s)]
*  and put down its weapons. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=93.12s)]
*  Yes, Hamas is responsible for the IDF bombing every hospital, every university, every refugee camp, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=96.32s)]
*  killing hundreds of journalists, killing hundreds of doctors, medics, striking [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=104.64s)]
*  humanitarian aid trucks as Palestinians desperately try to get their hands on food and water. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=112.0s)]
*  I mean, yeah, it's all Hamas using innocent people as human shields, right? It was Hamas [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=118.4s)]
*  that convinced the IDF to shoot children in the head. Snipers shot children in the head. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=124.8s)]
*  That's according to American doctors on the ground in Gaza who kept seeing children with [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=134.24s)]
*  gunshot wounds in their heads coming to the hospital. I'm sick of it. It's so shameful [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=140.08s)]
*  that our country is aiding and abetting this. Shameful. I'm embarrassed by it. I feel a lot [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=146.96s)]
*  of shame for it. Cenk, go ahead. Yeah, so in a minute we're gonna tell you about how [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=153.04000000000002s)]
*  Netanyahu's up on corruption charges involving maybe people that work with them taking money [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=156.48000000000002s)]
*  from Qatar. But it's okay, Hamas made them do it because Hamas is the excuse for everything [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=161.28s)]
*  Israel does now. In this case, they say human shields. Wait, what does human shields have to [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=166.16000000000003s)]
*  do with? You shot and murdered the medics. Hamas wasn't anywhere near them. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=169.52s)]
*  That's why this is an issue. If you'd killed Hamas, it wouldn't be an issue. Hamas was nowhere near [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=174.96s)]
*  them and you murdered them and they were medics. So, okay, under this rubric, well, everything in [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=179.84s)]
*  Gaza is Hamas's fault. So we could just go in and boom, execute people and go, Hamas made me do it. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=187.20000000000002s)]
*  And in fact, to Anna's point, they kinda are. The American doctors coming back and saying [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=194.32s)]
*  an extraordinary number of kids under the age of five with headshots from snipers from hundreds [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=200.08s)]
*  of yards away. They're not human shields. They're taking them out with headshots. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=207.6s)]
*  But it's all Hamas's fault. Why do you think they didn't do the very last part of the ceasefire deal [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=212.56s)]
*  where they were actually gonna get all the hostages back? You think that was an accident? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=218.32s)]
*  No, if they got all the hostages back, they couldn't blame everything on Hamas. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=222.64000000000001s)]
*  And they'd have no reason to keep murdering and slaughtering in Gaza. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=226.08s)]
*  The real reason they're doing it is because they wanna take the land and they're not hiding it. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=230.16000000000003s)]
*  They have maps of greater Israel. They talk about it openly. They're gonna take all that land. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=233.84s)]
*  So the hostages is a giant piece of propaganda for Israel. That's why they didn't do the last [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=238.48000000000002s)]
*  part of the ceasefire. But you might have thought, well, that's to be fair. I mean, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=246.48000000000002s)]
*  of course, the Israeli State Department is gonna do Israeli propaganda, but that was the US State [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=249.68s)]
*  Department. Now, look, I know what everybody's thinking. There is no difference between the US [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=254.4s)]
*  State Department and the Israeli State Department. You've never seen in your lifetime the US State [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=259.52s)]
*  Department say, Israel's wrong and we condemn them. Even when they murder Americans, which they've [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=263.84000000000003s)]
*  done a number of times now in the occupied territories recently. Have you even heard the [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=269.04s)]
*  US State Department even mildly complain? They'll be like oppressively say, it's unfortunate that [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=273.52s)]
*  an American citizen was killed. But I'm sure it was Hamas's fault, even though Israel sometimes, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=278.4s)]
*  literally again, sniper shots from hundreds of yards away, headshot, okay? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=282.79999999999995s)]
*  So it's super embarrassing that we serve another country. And literally everyone knows it. And in [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=288.47999999999996s)]
*  fact, even the Israel supporters now online are bragging about it going, yeah, that's right. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=296.08s)]
*  What are you gonna do about it? Cry harder. Ha ha, we run this place. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=299.91999999999996s)]
*  It's beyond shameful. So the IDF has confirmed that they did in fact open fire on the [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=304.8s)]
*  paramedics vehicle, but claimed that it was unmarked and was advancing suspiciously. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=314.32s)]
*  That's what they claim. Now the Palestinian Red Crescent alleges that both of the vehicles were [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=320.48s)]
*  in fact marked as humanitarian personnel. And the workers within the vehicle also [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=326.32s)]
*  were clearly marked just like the journalists who have the press [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=333.6s)]
*  vests on are clearly marked as journalists, but they get killed anyway. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=336.88s)]
*  Now of the 15 dead paramedics or medics, I should say, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=341.44s)]
*  eight were from the Palestinian Red Crescent, six were from Gaza Civil Defense Emergency Unit. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=345.2s)]
*  And one was a staffer from UNRWA. Now according to the UN, the teams were killed one by one on [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=351.28000000000003s)]
*  March 23rd as they went to retrieve casualties in Rafa. The IDF said an initial assessment [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=358.0s)]
*  determined that the troops killed a Hamas operative named Mohammed Amin Shobaki and [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=364.8s)]
*  eight other militants. However, none of the dead staffers from the Red Crescent and Civil Defense [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=371.84s)]
*  had that name and no other bodies were reported found at the site. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=377.28s)]
*  The IDF did not immediately respond to requests for names of the other alleged militants killed [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=383.28s)]
*  or for comment on how the emergency workers came to be buried in that shallow grave. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=389.52s)]
*  Yeah, look, again, the whole world knows they're lying. They can't point to a single Hamas member [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=394.64s)]
*  there, but they think it doesn't matter. We can do the most outrageous lie. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=399.67999999999995s)]
*  And they're right. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=403.44s)]
*  And we'll get this US State Department and the US President and every politician in America [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=404.23999999999995s)]
*  to repeat that lie for us. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=409.44s)]
*  Yeah, they're right. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=410.71999999999997s)]
*  And by the way, we think the right wing in America is mindless. So we'll just get them to be our [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=411.44s)]
*  robots and they'll go out there. If Trump says it and his State Department says it like dogs, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=416.8s)]
*  they'll go out there and say, of course, Israel should be able to slaughter anyone and we should [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=421.92s)]
*  write them a blank check. I think they're gonna find out that that's not gonna last too much longer. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=426.15999999999997s)]
*  But we'll find out, because Nannyahu already knows about the American left. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=431.28s)]
*  He's now starting to say they're like radical Islamists. So we're about to be terrorists. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=436.64s)]
*  When the right wing turns on Israel, you'll also be terrorists, because Israel runs this place. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=441.52s)]
*  Well, the idea of continues its rampage in Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=446.8s)]
*  is facing some problems domestically. So yesterday, two of his aides were arrested [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=453.6s)]
*  in connection to, get a load of this, improper payments with the country of Qatar. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=459.2s)]
*  Now, here's what we know according to the judge overseeing the case. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=465.2s)]
*  The judge writes that in the period under investigation, an American lobbying company [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=469.68s)]
*  called the Third Circle, owned by lobbyist Jay Footlick, formed a direct connection with [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=474.24s)]
*  Netanyahu aide Jonathan Urich in order to put a positive spin on Doha's role as a facilitator [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=480.32s)]
*  in the hostage deal negotiations between Israel and Hamas. The judge adds that Qatar [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=489.03999999999996s)]
*  also wanted Urich to spread negative messaging about Egypt's role in the negotiations as part [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=495.04s)]
*  of efforts to improve Qatar's image on the issue. Now, there's an Israeli businessman by the name of [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=502.40000000000003s)]
*  Gil Berger, and he's also involved in all of this. Last week, he told Israel's public broadcaster [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=509.20000000000005s)]
*  that he transferred money to the other Netanyahu aide by the name of Eli Feldstein [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=515.28s)]
*  on behalf of a US lobbyist working for Qatar. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=523.04s)]
*  Last year, Feldstein was charged with and arrested for leaking classified information [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=527.1999999999999s)]
*  to foreign news outlets. Now, Netanyahu was summoned to court to testify in his aides' case. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=533.12s)]
*  However, Netanyahu is not a suspect himself. So in a video statement released after what he said [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=539.28s)]
*  was an hour of testimony, Netanyahu accused Israeli police of seeking to topple his right-wing [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=545.52s)]
*  government. So Netanyahu is currently attempting to replace Ronan Barr, who's the head of the [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=551.52s)]
*  Israeli Shin Bet. And Shin Bet is overseeing the Qatar case alongside Israeli police. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=558.0s)]
*  Netanyahu, who's also by the way facing numerous corruption charges, is also trying to replace [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=564.48s)]
*  Israel's attorney general. So protests or protesters have taken to the streets of Israel, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=569.04s)]
*  accusing the prime minister of undermining Israel's democracy. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=574.24s)]
*  Yeah, so look, there's two different issues here. One is what the hell did they do with Qatar? [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=578.88s)]
*  Because they funneled money to Hamas through Qatar. I thought Hamas was the devil and Hamas [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=583.28s)]
*  made you do everything. So why did you finance them all these years? Or was it super convenient [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=587.76s)]
*  for the right-wing in Israel to say, look at terrible Hamas. We must destroy everything in [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=594.56s)]
*  Gaza and take all that land because of Hamas who we funneled all this money to and supported. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=600.56s)]
*  Interesting. And now when we're about to find out what your aides did, and by the way, maybe [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=606.32s)]
*  even taking money for themselves because there's bribery and money laundering, etc. charges in there. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=610.1600000000001s)]
*  All of a sudden you wanna fire the attorney general and the head of Shin Bet. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=615.12s)]
*  Okay, so now we're gonna find out, like we are in Turkey and to some degree here in America, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=618.72s)]
*  does Israel have a democracy that remains? Because if you let him remove the attorney general and the [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=624.8000000000001s)]
*  head of the police basically, you're saying it's lawless. Just like Erdogan removing his top [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=630.56s)]
*  political opponent, Putin did it earlier, etc. Here in America, we're fighting Trump, saying [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=637.4399999999999s)]
*  ignoring the courts. So I don't think Israel's a democracy in the first place because they [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=642.88s)]
*  occupy five and a half million other people. It doesn't count if you don't let other people [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=648.3199999999999s)]
*  you occupy vote. But within Israel, they had a couple of good things. They had a good functioning [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=653.4399999999999s)]
*  press that would challenge the government frequently. They have good protests, people [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=658.8s)]
*  go on the streets and fight for what they believe in. There's things to praise inside there, right? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=662.24s)]
*  It's democracy like. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=667.76s)]
*  Yeah, it's kind of democracy. But if you take away anyone investigating the executive branch, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=669.12s)]
*  in this case Netanyahu, you don't have a democracy left. So we'll see, is Israel in favor of becoming [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=674.7199999999999s)]
*  an authoritarian government, not just for the Palestinians, but for the Jewish citizens as well. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=680.3199999999999s)]
*  Or if they're gonna fight back against Netanyahu, only time will tell. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXDU7odWlU&t=685.12s)]
