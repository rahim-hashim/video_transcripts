# Report: FEMA Head Admits Something DISTURBING
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Ay6UMoM8A)
*  very much authority to get everything done I need to do. There's somewhere south of 20% [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Ay6UMoM8A&t=0.0s)]
*  that decide that they are going to get in the way change. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Ay6UMoM8A&t=10.24s)]
*  You can ask anybody that those 20% of people are a problem. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Ay6UMoM8A&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  And they have to be sidelined. So don't get in my way. If you're those 20% of people, I will run right over you. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Ay6UMoM8A&t=20.6s)]
*  That was David Richardson. Yeah, Richardson. He's the new head of FEMA and he looks mad. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Ay6UMoM8A&t=33.56s)]
*  He looks like a mad guy, all right? Look at that picture. Why are you so mad? Why don't you smile [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Ay6UMoM8A&t=42.44s)]
*  more bro? What's going on? Anyway, he's making headlines. In fact, he made headlines [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Ay6UMoM8A&t=47.48s)]
*  about a month after warning his staff to not get in his way. And now he's making [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Ay6UMoM8A&t=52.599999999999994s)]
*  headlines because of the, I don't know if I believe this. Allegedly, he claimed that [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Ay6UMoM8A&t=59.959999999999994s)]
*  he didn't know that hurricane season is a thing. How do you not know? I live in California. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Ay6UMoM8A&t=67.08s)]
*  Hurricanes don't happen in California. I know hurricane seasons are a thing. I don't believe [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Ay6UMoM8A&t=72.12s)]
*  that he doesn't know. So I don't know. We're asking in a poll in the live chat shows six to eight [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Ay6UMoM8A&t=76.04s)]
*  Eastern Monday through Friday. Be part of the show. Whether you think he's serious or joking, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Ay6UMoM8A&t=81.24000000000001s)]
*  but on face alone, I don't think that guy ever jokes. Yeah, that's actually a really good point, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Ay6UMoM8A&t=86.60000000000001s)]
*  Cenk. That's a really good piece of evidence. Look at that photo. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Ay6UMoM8A&t=92.36000000000001s)]
*  And look at the angry speech. I'll run you over. Yeah, that guy doesn't have a sense of humor at all. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Ay6UMoM8A&t=95.16000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so you've seen me angry once or twice on the internet, right? So it's not like I don't know how [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Ay6UMoM8A&t=100.68s)]
*  to be angry, but then I also know how to joke around, right? And that guy looks like he's never [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Ay6UMoM8A&t=105.56s)]
*  joked in his life. Okay, you know what? I like to be with the in crowd. And since the audience is [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Ay6UMoM8A&t=110.36s)]
*  saying that he was being serious, I agree with you. He was being serious. He doesn't know that [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Ay6UMoM8A&t=116.2s)]
*  hurricane season exists, which is insane. He is the current head of FEMA under the Trump [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Ay6UMoM8A&t=119.4s)]
*  administration, even though he hasn't been confirmed for the role. Now, according to [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Ay6UMoM8A&t=125.56s)]
*  four sources who spoke to Reuters, Richardson made the remark during an all hands [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Ay6UMoM8A&t=129.88s)]
*  briefing this week. All hands meetings usually go very smoothly and everyone's usually happy [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Ay6UMoM8A&t=135.32s)]
*  afterwards. Now, hundreds of FEMA staffers and interagency partners were present. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Ay6UMoM8A&t=139.95999999999998s)]
*  And staff was unclear as to whether or not he was joking. So the Department of Homeland Security [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Ay6UMoM8A&t=145.23999999999998s)]
*  has responded to the report by saying, obviously he was joking. Here's their statement. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Ay6UMoM8A&t=151.64s)]
*  Despite mean spirited attempts to falsely frame a joke as policy, there is no uncertainty about [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Ay6UMoM8A&t=157.72s)]
*  what FEMA will be doing this hurricane season. FEMA is laser focused on disaster response and [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Ay6UMoM8A&t=163.88s)]
*  protecting the American people. FEMA under Richardson is activated in preparation for [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Ay6UMoM8A&t=170.84s)]
*  hurricane season. However, Richardson's comment purporting ignorance about hurricane season [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Ay6UMoM8A&t=176.44s)]
*  spread among agency staff, spurring confusion and reigniting concern about his lack of familiarity [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Ay6UMoM8A&t=182.12s)]
*  with FEMA's operations, said three sources. And look, I do think that this is potentially an issue. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Ay6UMoM8A&t=189.24s)]
*  He has absolutely zero disaster response experience, which seems like you should have [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Ay6UMoM8A&t=195.16s)]
*  if you're gonna be the head of FEMA. But he was previously the Assistant Secretary for the [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Ay6UMoM8A&t=201.88s)]
*  Department of Homeland Security's Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office, and also served as a [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Ay6UMoM8A&t=207.0s)]
*  ground combat officer in the Marine Corps. So- [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Ay6UMoM8A&t=214.28s)]
*  Yeah, no, he has some experience now because he created an emergency and now he's gotta manage it. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Ay6UMoM8A&t=217.56s)]
*  Okay, but look guys, putting the speculation aside about whether he was kidding or not, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Ay6UMoM8A&t=224.04s)]
*  they were looking to cut FEMA funding. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Ay6UMoM8A&t=229.72s)]
*  Exactly, yeah. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Ay6UMoM8A&t=231.4s)]
*  So and these are the guys who complained, my God, Biden's FEMA isn't giving to [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Ay6UMoM8A&t=232.28s)]
*  Trump supporters in North Carolina. So let's cut FEMA so you get less help. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Ay6UMoM8A&t=236.68s)]
*  And we've had members write in all over, a tornadoes, this, that, the other thing. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Ay6UMoM8A&t=241.16s)]
*  In their experience, FEMA was very slow to respond because I don't know whether it's this [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Ay6UMoM8A&t=246.52s)]
*  brother has no experience in it, doesn't care about it, or because they're looking to cut, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Ay6UMoM8A&t=252.2s)]
*  cut, cut, and they don't really care about you. That's the important part. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Ay6UMoM8A&t=256.44s)]
*  Yeah, so according to a source who spoke with Reuters, the back and forth on updating [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Ay6UMoM8A&t=259.56s)]
*  the agency's disaster plan and a lack of clear strategic guidance [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Ay6UMoM8A&t=264.28s)]
*  happened to be some issues under his leadership. And yeah, we should be concerned, especially as [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Ay6UMoM8A&t=269.96s)]
*  these natural disasters happen more frequently with more intensity, not good. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Ay6UMoM8A&t=275.16s)]
*  Yeah, and remember, I mean, you want to talk about serious or not serious. Donald Trump is the guy who [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Ay6UMoM8A&t=282.2s)]
*  drew with a sharpie the path of a hurricane because he lied about it. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Ay6UMoM8A&t=288.28s)]
*  So he changed the path of the hurricane on the map that he showed the country. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Ay6UMoM8A&t=292.92s)]
*  Yeah. And people got panicked because they thought they were in a hurricane zone when they weren't. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Ay6UMoM8A&t=297.56s)]
*  And Trump's like, who cares if they're all panicking and they're all worried about that [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Ay6UMoM8A&t=302.68s)]
*  they're going to die. Keeping people on their toes. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Ay6UMoM8A&t=306.6s)]
*  Yeah, it's more important that I be right. So give me a sharpie. Okay, no, whether people get [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Ay6UMoM8A&t=309.0s)]
*  out of here. The hurricane is now going this way. I mean, a bunch of goofballs. Do they care to make [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Ay6UMoM8A&t=314.44s)]
*  sure that you're okay in an emergency? Of course not. Every time you ring the bell below, an angel [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Ay6UMoM8A&t=319.24s)]
*  gets a swings. Totally not true, but it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Ay6UMoM8A&t=324.04s)]
