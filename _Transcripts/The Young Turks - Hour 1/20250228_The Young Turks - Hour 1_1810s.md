On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful.

We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

# Shouting Match Between Trump, Vance & Zelensky During Oval Office Press Conference
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [February 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4)
*  You have nice ocean and don't feel now, but you will feel it in the future. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=0.0s)]
*  God bless. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=5.84s)]
*  You don't know that. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=6.84s)]
*  God bless. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=7.84s)]
*  You don't know that. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=8.84s)]
*  God bless. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=9.84s)]
*  You will not have war. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=10.84s)]
*  Don't tell us what we're gonna feel. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=11.84s)]
*  Have you said thank you once? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=12.84s)]
*  A lot of times. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=13.84s)]
*  No, in this entire meeting. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=14.84s)]
*  You said thank you. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=15.84s)]
*  We gave you military equipment. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=16.84s)]
*  You wanted military equipment. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=17.84s)]
*  And you met our brave, but they had to use our military. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=18.84s)]
*  What about the rest of you? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=21.76s)]
*  If you didn't have our military equipment. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=22.76s)]
*  You invited me to speak. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=24.76s)]
*  If you didn't have our military equipment, this war would have been over in two weeks. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=25.76s)]
*  What if anything? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=30.520000000000003s)]
*  What if a bomb drops on your head right now? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=31.520000000000003s)]
*  Okay? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=34.52s)]
*  Why did they break it? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=35.52s)]
*  This is gonna be great television, I will say that. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=36.52s)]
*  All right, so as you can see, that was a joint press conference with President Donald Trump, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=39.52s)]
*  Vice President, JD Vance, and Ukrainian President, Vladimir Zelensky. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=45.52s)]
*  Things got a little out of hand today. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=49.96s)]
*  The negotiations between Ukraine and the US have collapsed, at least for the time being. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  We have more video to show you. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=57.879999999999995s)]
*  But Cenk, what do you make of this? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=59.44s)]
*  This is crazy. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=61.4s)]
*  Yeah, so we gotta get you the details which are just coming in now. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=62.4s)]
*  Because what happened before the meeting, it turns out, is the most critical part. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=67.16s)]
*  And what probably led to the blow up in the meeting. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=71.4s)]
*  We're asking you in the live chat, who's at fault here, Zelensky or Trump and Vance? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=74.25999999999999s)]
*  That's a little complicated in my opinion. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=79.68s)]
*  I think there's plenty of blame on both sides. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=81.44s)]
*  And I don't say that in a both-side-ism kind of way. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=85.2s)]
*  I think that, as you'll see here in the commentary, I think Zelensky did one thing to trigger [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=88.44s)]
*  all this. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=93.36s)]
*  But ultimately, especially when you find out what happened before the meeting, the blame's [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=94.56s)]
*  gonna shift over the folks who are trying to get something out of Ukraine that doesn't [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=98.96s)]
*  make any sense. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=104.82s)]
*  And that's totally wrong. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=105.82s)]
*  So I think it is Trump and Vance, ultimately. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=106.82s)]
*  But let's take you through the twists and turns first. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=109.03999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's back to you. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=111.16s)]
*  Okay, so yeah, we do have some details, but it's still a developing story. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=112.16s)]
*  But in the exchange, it began whenever Trump asked if he was aligning, or he was asked [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=116.24s)]
*  if he was aligning with either Ukraine or Russia too much. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=122.12s)]
*  Trump argued that because he's trying to make a deal with both Russia and Ukraine, he's [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=126.6s)]
*  not aligning with either of them. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=130.46s)]
*  And he just wants what's better for us here in the United States. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=132.44s)]
*  JD Vance then, he jumped in on Trump's answer to bash President Joe Biden. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=135.79999999999998s)]
*  Don't know why that was relevant, saying that Biden was all talk and no action. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=141.67999999999998s)]
*  But Trump's administration was doing the right thing by engaging in diplomacy, as he just [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=146.45999999999998s)]
*  saw in that clip. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=151.44s)]
*  That was diplomacy that was happening. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=152.44s)]
*  And then Zelensky jumped in on that statement. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=154.61999999999998s)]
*  And he started telling JD Vance that previous efforts at diplomacy between Ukraine and Russia [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=157.83999999999997s)]
*  resulted in Russia invading Ukraine in 2022. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=163.79999999999998s)]
*  And he asked what would be different this time? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=168.23999999999998s)]
*  And that is when things really started to go off the rails. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=170.78s)]
*  Let's take a look. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=173.48s)]
*  I'm talking about the kind of diplomacy that's gonna end the destruction of your country. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=174.48s)]
*  Yes, but if you- Mr. President, Mr. President, with respect, I think it's disrespectful for [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=178.12s)]
*  you to come into the Oval Office and try to litigate this in front of the American media. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=182.04s)]
*  Right now, you guys are going around and forcing conscripts to the front lines because you [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=185.7s)]
*  have manpower problems. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=190.2s)]
*  You should be thanking the president for trying to bring it into this conflict. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=191.92s)]
*  Have you ever been to Ukraine that you say what problems we have? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=195.11999999999998s)]
*  I have been to- I've actually watched and seen the stories. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=198.28s)]
*  And I know what happens is you bring people, you bring them on a propaganda tour, Mr. President. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=204.1s)]
*  Do you disagree that you've had problems bringing people into your military? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=209.51999999999998s)]
*  And do you think that it's respectful to come to the Oval Office of the United States of [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=213.92s)]
*  America and attack the administration that is trying to prevent the destruction of your [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=217.84s)]
*  country? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=222.32s)]
*  Okay, so then Zelensky replied to all of that by suggesting that Russia could possibly threaten [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=223.32s)]
*  the United States in the future before long, which Trump did not like. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=230.28s)]
*  Here's that. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=235.08s)]
*  During the war, everybody has problems, even you, but you have nice ocean and don't feel [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=236.08s)]
*  now, but you will feel it in the future. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=242.8s)]
*  You don't know that. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=246.52s)]
*  God bless, God bless, you will not have a war. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=247.52s)]
*  Don't tell us what we're going to feel. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=250.04000000000002s)]
*  We're trying to solve a problem. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=251.72s)]
*  Don't tell us what we're going to feel. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=253.34s)]
*  I'm not telling you. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=254.76000000000002s)]
*  Because you're in no position to dictate that. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=255.76000000000002s)]
*  Remember that. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=258.04s)]
*  You're in no position to dictate what we're going to feel. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=259.04s)]
*  We're going to feel very good. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=263.72s)]
*  We're going to feel very good and very strong. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=265.76s)]
*  You're right now not in a very good position. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=269.32s)]
*  You've allowed yourself to be in a very bad position and it happens to be right about [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=271.84s)]
*  now. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=275.79999999999995s)]
*  You're not in a good position. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=276.79999999999995s)]
*  You don't have the cards right now. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=278.79999999999995s)]
*  With us, you start having cards. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=281.4s)]
*  Right now you're playing cards. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=283.4s)]
*  You're gambling with the lives of millions of people. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=286.4s)]
*  You're gambling with World War III. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=289.88s)]
*  You're gambling with World War III. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=292.44s)]
*  And what you're doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country, that's back [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=295.44s)]
*  to you far more than a lot of people said they should have. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=301.72s)]
*  That's giving me a headache. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=305.88s)]
*  But afterwards, they all shook hands and everybody started to get along a lot better. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=306.88s)]
*  Just kidding. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=312.16s)]
*  That's not what happened at all. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=313.16s)]
*  Here's more. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=314.16s)]

*  Okay. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=384.82s)]

*  But then Russia went on to violate it. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=396.54s)]
*  But Trump was like, don't talk about my boy Putin like that. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=398.74s)]
*  Things got extra heated. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=402.21999999999997s)]
*  Here's that. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=403.46s)]
*  What if the bomb drops on your head right now? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=404.46s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=407.26s)]
*  Why did they break it? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=408.26s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=409.26s)]
*  They broke it with Biden because Biden, they didn't respect him. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=410.26s)]
*  They didn't respect Obama. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=413.06s)]
*  They respect me. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=414.98s)]

*  He did, maybe. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=421.18s)]
*  Maybe he did. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=422.66s)]
*  I don't know what happened. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=423.66s)]
*  But he didn't break them with me. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=424.66s)]
*  He wants to make a deal. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=426.18s)]
*  I don't know if he can make a deal. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=427.18s)]
*  The problem is, I've empowered you to be a tough guy. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=429.26s)]
*  And I don't think he'd be a tough guy without the United States. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=433.70000000000005s)]
*  And your people are very brave. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=436.86s)]
*  But you're either going to make a deal or we're out. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=439.1s)]
*  And if we're out, you'll fight it out. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=441.74s)]
*  I don't think it's going to be pretty. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=444.70000000000005s)]
*  But you'll fight it out. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=446.54s)]
*  But you don't have the cards. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=447.54s)]
*  But once we sign that deal, you're in a much better position. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=450.02000000000004s)]
*  But you're not acting at all thankful. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=453.78000000000003s)]
*  And that's not a nice thing. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=455.98s)]
*  I'll be honest, that's not a nice thing. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=457.06s)]
*  All right, I think we've seen enough. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=459.06s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=461.74s)]
*  This is going to be great television, I will say that. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=462.74s)]
*  So there was supposed to be another joint conference after that, later that day. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=468.42s)]
*  But the White House has canceled it, as you can imagine. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=473.1s)]
*  Trump also issued the following statement on Truth Social. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=476.34s)]
*  It said, this is a statement from President Donald J Trump. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=479.54s)]
*  We had a very meaningful meeting in the White House today. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=483.26s)]
*  Much was learned that could never be understood without conversation under such fire and pressure. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=486.3s)]
*  It's amazing what comes out through emotion. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=491.82s)]
*  And I have determined that President Zelensky is not ready for peace if America is involved. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=493.62s)]
*  Because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=498.46s)]
*  I don't want advantage, I want peace. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=502.86s)]
*  He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=505.02s)]
*  He can come back when he is ready for peace. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=509.34s)]
*  Go to your room, you can come back when you're ready to talk. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=512.46s)]
*  But now that we've shown you the whole dramatic situation, the whole confrontation, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=515.14s)]
*  we should note that according to a report by Fox News, tensions were already high going into this meeting. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=519.34s)]
*  They report, according to sources close to Zelensky, tempers had flared even before the event began. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=525.66s)]
*  The Ukrainian president was apparently presented with a minerals for security agreement by the Trump administration [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=531.9s)]
*  prior to the press event. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=538.26s)]
*  But the deal included no security guarantees to protect Ukraine from another Russian invasion. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=539.94s)]
*  Zelensky had warned repeatedly ahead of his trip to Washington DC that in order to reach a mineral agreement, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=545.82s)]
*  Kiev needed these security assurances. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=552.86s)]
*  Even so, he angered Trump and Vance by rejecting the deal, a source said. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=555.3000000000001s)]
*  And then John Hudson tweeted that the Trump administration is considering ending all ongoing [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=560.5s)]
*  shipments of military aid to Ukraine in response to Zelensky's remarks in the Oval Office on Friday, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=565.98s)]
*  and has perceived intransigence in the peace process per senior administration official. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=571.74s)]
*  This is complicated because we know that these highly diplomatic negotiations and [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=577.98s)]
*  it feels weird calling this diplomacy because it was so undiplomatic, but that's what this is, right? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=584.74s)]
*  So whenever you have these big world global conflicts, geopolitical conflicts that involve [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=589.6999999999999s)]
*  millions and millions of people, as Trump pointed out, everything also feels so fickle, right? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=595.6999999999999s)]
*  It's so big, but also so fickle, so easily breakable. And I am worried that just because [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=601.22s)]
*  Zelensky lost his temper a little bit or appeared ungrateful in the eyes of Trump and Vance, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=608.1s)]
*  that millions and millions of people could indeed suffer for it. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=613.46s)]
*  So Cenk, what do you make of all this? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=616.6600000000001s)]
*  So I'm going to say what I think Zelensky did wrong and then Trump and Vance, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=619.14s)]
*  but understand that the mineral rights are what's causing all of this. And understand that the top [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=623.62s)]
*  mineral we're talking about is lithium. That's what goes into Tesla's batteries. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=631.46s)]
*  So that's the curveball here. Elon somehow got involved in this mess. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=636.4200000000001s)]
*  And now we can't get to a negotiated peace that we all want because now there's a third actor involved, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=642.02s)]
*  America slash all of Elon Musk corporations saying, no, I want a piece of the action. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=650.74s)]
*  Where the hell did you come from? And why are you making this harder? Okay, so I'll get back to that. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=656.58s)]
*  So in terms of what Zelensky did wrong, look, I watched the whole thing. You got 40 minutes [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=661.7s)]
*  in the beginning, things are going relatively okay. Then where did it start to go wrong? [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=667.22s)]
*  It was Zelensky asking Vance a question. Now normally they're answering the [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=674.1800000000001s)]
*  reporters questions and Zelensky asked a question of Vance that did challenge him. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=678.5s)]
*  Now it wasn't rude, but it was challenging, right? So he didn't call him any names. He didn't say the [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=684.5s)]
*  things that Trump and Vance said that you just saw with your own eyes. But Zelensky started that [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=689.94s)]
*  interaction. Okay, then from then on, JD Vance took apparently great offense to that. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=695.7s)]
*  And then just started insulting him and Ukraine and the war effort. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=701.14s)]
*  And then it devolved and you saw the rest. Okay, so you could say, hey, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=704.82s)]
*  if you're Zelensky and you're coming hat in hand and we've given them, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=709.0600000000001s)]
*  we've assigned $183 billion to go there. We've already spent $140 billion. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=713.78s)]
*  A little bit complicated because the weapons do go there, but there are older weapons. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=719.38s)]
*  The money's actually going to defense contractors in America to get new weapons for us to keep. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=722.98s)]
*  But 140 billion of weapons kind of has already gone to Ukraine. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=728.5s)]
*  And also assistance outside of weapons. So as we're giving this to Ukraine, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=734.1s)]
*  of course we're hoping that they're grateful for it, etc, etc. But now to be fair to Zelensky, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=739.78s)]
*  he has said that he's grateful for it and thanks the American people and the government, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=745.38s)]
*  I don't know, 200 times, 2000 times. So Vance is making it seem like he's never done it. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=749.78s)]
*  And I guess he caught feelings because Zelensky asked him a question and he thought that that was [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=756.3399999999999s)]
*  disrespectful. Give us your goddamn minerals. We're not gonna give you any security guarantees. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=761.9399999999999s)]
*  And how dare you disrespect us? So now when you get to the fault of Vance and Trump, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=767.3s)]
*  guys, I'm not like other people. And I think you all know that in a lot of ways. But what I mean by [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=774.9s)]
*  that is I mind that mess a lot less than I mind the substance, right? If we had that mess of a [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=780.8199999999999s)]
*  conflict in the Oval Office, everyone's like, a gas, the diplomacy is brewing up. Well, kind of, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=787.62s)]
*  maybe, but it really depends on the substance and the result. So if you got that kind of weird [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=792.5s)]
*  shouting match that we don't expect it is unprecedented in our lifetimes where the president [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=797.4599999999999s)]
*  yells at one of our allies in the Oval Office with cameras in there. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=802.42s)]
*  But maybe chalk it up to transparency. Okay, I mean, that's a really generous take on it. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=805.9399999999999s)]
*  But when you get to the substance, no, look at all these things that Trump and Vance in that [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=812.9s)]
*  confrontation are just giving away leverage to Russia in everything they say. They say, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=819.54s)]
*  you don't have enough manpower and you've got problems on the front lines. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=824.9s)]
*  When you bring people into your country, you're just doing a propaganda tour like he's the bad [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=829.14s)]
*  guy. And then like Russia's not doing propaganda, the Ukrainians are doing propaganda. Trump said [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=833.0600000000001s)]
*  over and over again, you're not in a good position. You don't have any cards. You might create World [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=838.98s)]
*  War III. You're not winning. So guys, why that's so important, no matter what side of the political [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=843.86s)]
*  divisions you are here in the US. I hope that all of us wanna get to peace. When you are trying to [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=850.1800000000001s)]
*  get a deal with the other side, that is yes, Russia, Russia is the other side here. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=856.26s)]
*  You wanna show as much strength on your side as possible. I mean, we're in good shape. Ukraine's [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=862.26s)]
*  in good shape. We can keep this war going forever. We don't want to. We wanna get to a settlement, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=866.26s)]
*  but we're really strong. That's how you create enough leverage so you can get to a compromise [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=870.8199999999999s)]
*  and a deal and to peace. That should be your goal. But every piece of leverage you give away, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=875.9399999999999s)]
*  Ukraine's in terrible shape. It's not winning. It doesn't have the right cards. It doesn't have [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=882.1s)]
*  enough manpower and we might take its money away. Then Russia's gonna go, why do I wanna deal? [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=886.02s)]
*  I don't wanna deal. I want everything now. I wanna keep the land. I might want more land. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=890.18s)]
*  I don't even know if I want peace if it turns out I'm gonna be able to take this country [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=895.3s)]
*  when America withdraws. So if you're trying to get to peace, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=898.8199999999999s)]
*  Trump and Vance could not have played it worse. But that gets the heart of it, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=901.9399999999999s)]
*  which is that I don't think they're trying to get to peace. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=907.3s)]
*  Look, I gave Trump credit for, hey, listen, you wanna drive towards peace? Great. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=909.86s)]
*  I give Biden discredit for not trying to get to peace at all between Ukraine and Russia. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=914.5s)]
*  I didn't see any effort at all. It seemed like they were thrilled to be draining Russian resources [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=919.3000000000001s)]
*  at the expense of the Ukrainian people and our budget, right? So if Trump was actually driving [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=923.86s)]
*  towards peace, even if it was a painful piece, which is what all peace negotiations are at the [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=931.86s)]
*  end and deals are, no problem. But if we're not trying to drive towards peace and we're just [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=937.0600000000001s)]
*  trying to get a whole bunch of minerals from them, then again, it's not a negotiation and [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=941.7s)]
*  it isn't diplomacy, it's just a robbery. And I'll remind you guys of this if you missed [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=947.3000000000001s)]
*  the earlier show. The way that this all took a giant curveball when Trump started calling [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=950.98s)]
*  Zelensky a dictator and pretending that Ukraine invaded Russia instead of the other way around. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=956.26s)]
*  It's because all of a sudden, our treasury secretary went to Ukraine and met with Zelensky [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=962.5s)]
*  and passed him a piece of paper that said, we want $500 billion of your [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=968.5s)]
*  mineral rights in Ukraine for free. And Zelensky's like, what? And he's like, sign it out, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=973.14s)]
*  sign it out. And Zelensky's like, I'm not gonna sign it now. This gives away the natural resources [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=978.26s)]
*  of my people. And you guys, again, have given 140 billion, I really appreciate it. But why am I [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=982.74s)]
*  giving you back 500 billion? And who am I giving it to? It doesn't even clarify. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=988.82s)]
*  Because, guys, this is super important for you to understand, especially if you're in the right wing [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=993.38s)]
*  or if you watch mainstream media and you've listened to this propaganda your whole life. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=997.14s)]
*  When we rob the natural resources of another country, whether it's in the Middle East for oil [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1001.46s)]
*  or in this case, not minerals, in Ukraine, we don't get it. The American taxpayers don't get [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1007.54s)]
*  any of it. American corporations get it. And in this case, the corporation that needs [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1013.06s)]
*  lithium the most is Tesla. So this is a dirty deal the whole way through. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1018.8199999999999s)]
*  And that's why Zelensky seemed to have a short temper there. I think he did have a short temper. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1024.6599999999999s)]
*  But the reason is because he probably didn't even want this deal. They come in, they go, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1028.8999999999999s)]
*  minerals for security. He's like, God damn it, where the hell did this [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1032.82s)]
*  mineral thing come from? But okay, fine, I'll pay the ransom. And then they come in and they go, [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1035.46s)]
*  switcheroo, just kidding, no security guarantees, but give us the minerals anyway. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1040.1799999999998s)]
*  As I've told you before, it reminds me of the big Lebowski, where they say, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1044.5s)]
*  we want some money anyway, Lebowski. Well, that doesn't make any sense. Is this a deal or is it [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1047.54s)]
*  not a deal? And what happened in negotiating with Russia? We've totally forgotten that. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1053.54s)]
*  Instead, we're badgering and bashing and negotiating against our own ally. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1057.3s)]
*  And now I see the right wing say, Ukraine's not an ally. Guys, I mean, I don't know what topsy [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1062.26s)]
*  turvy world you're living in, where Ukraine is not an ally, but what Russia is? And what, [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1066.98s)]
*  Ukraine is the aggressor when we all saw with our own eyes Russia invade them? [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1072.42s)]
*  Yes, there's nuance in Russia wanting to not have NATO encroach on their borders. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1076.82s)]
*  But there's no nuance that Russia definitely invaded Ukraine. Ukraine is definitely our ally. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1081.86s)]
*  We took away their nukes and said, if you give your nukes away after the Soviet Union dissolve, [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1088.02s)]
*  we will protect you. How is that not our ally? So right now, the cause of peace has been set back [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1093.86s)]
*  greatly. And the number one culprit is the thing that the media is barely talking about, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1101.54s)]
*  which is that our random insistence that American corporations get the natural resource of Ukraine [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1106.5s)]
*  in the middle of these negotiations, an issue that had not arisen at all before. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1112.82s)]
*  All right, Moz. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1117.62s)]
*  Well, you make some good points. One of the things you said that actually then you also [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1118.42s)]
*  elaborated on, which talks to the fact that you said you're not as worried about what was happening [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1123.54s)]
*  that the quorum and all that stuff. But then you also came back and said that the problem is [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1129.38s)]
*  the there's a negotiation going on and basically they revealed their cards [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1134.9s)]
*  to Putin. I mean, Putin now has a much higher upper hand on this situation because he knows [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1141.94s)]
*  that America does not have Ukraine's back and they did it in front of cameras. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1148.5800000000002s)]
*  It's kind of like when Vito Corleone tells Sonny, don't talk about the family business in front of [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1151.78s)]
*  other people. And that's what they were doing here. So that's the danger in doing what they [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1157.3000000000002s)]
*  just did. It felt like JD Vance was this obsequious son who was angry at his brother [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1161.78s)]
*  and started yelling and say, you don't respect dad. And Zelensky's going, I respect that. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1170.18s)]
*  What do you mean I don't respect? You don't respect that. You're gonna feel the pain too. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1174.58s)]
*  We're not gonna feel the pain. I mean, it was just like, what is going on? And part of what I [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1178.74s)]
*  thought he was saying when he said you're gonna feel the pain, it's not just that Russia may [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1184.26s)]
*  start a war with America, but also the results of these types of things where you end up with [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1188.98s)]
*  people fleeing war-torn areas, people fleeing countries that have been attacked. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1194.74s)]
*  And then here we are as Americans going, we don't want anyone else coming to America [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1199.46s)]
*  from these other countries. And yet we're involved in causing chaos in these countries [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1203.94s)]
*  so that those people will wanna come here. And it goes back to your point also of the [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1208.9s)]
*  natural resources and how this is colonialism. This is modern colonialism. This is what we're [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1215.1399999999999s)]
*  doing and we're getting in cahoots with Putin. And what I watched was that Trump and JD Vance [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1220.5s)]
*  are Russian assets. That's what I saw. Yeah, I think that, look, I don't wanna [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1227.78s)]
*  get into whether they're Russian assets. I genuinely don't know what Trump has with [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1235.7s)]
*  Putin, if they have deals or not. Guys, right now, as you're gonna find out later in the program [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1243.3s)]
*  with the other stories we're doing, there's just brazen bribery going on. There's a guy who runs a [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1247.54s)]
*  crypto company that just gave Trump's meme coin or whatever the F they're doing, $75 million. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1253.06s)]
*  They're just literally bribing the president. And now Elon Musk is saying, [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1261.1399999999999s)]
*  we're gonna cancel Verizon's deal with the FAA. Okay, you're doing $2.4 billion in cuts. No, [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1265.78s)]
*  no, we're not cutting. We're reallocating to where? Starlink. That's your company. That's crazy. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1270.26s)]
*  That's crazy. The robbery has begun and the mineral in Ukraine is part of that robbery. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1275.06s)]
*  So guys, here, one more thing. One of our members wrote in something, the same exact thing that I [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1282.9s)]
*  was thinking, and he put it well, Eclectic Miscellane on tyt.com says, so now we're yelling at world [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1287.62s)]
*  leaders in the Oval Office. Okay, Trump, now do Netanyahu. See, I think that contrast is really [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1293.7s)]
*  interesting, cuz everybody can see, and by the way, the right wing was also aggrieved about this. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1300.5s)]
*  When Netanyahu comes in, Trump is the nicest guy in the world. Mr. Prime Minister, great to see you. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1305.8600000000001s)]
*  He literally put in the chair for him like he was his butler or something. Trump did for Netanyahu. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1311.7s)]
*  So kid gloves for Netanyahu and allies that are on your team, whatever team that is, not Team America, [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1317.54s)]
*  but Team Trump and Team Jared Kushner, etc. And whatever moronic plans you have for waterfront [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1324.58s)]
*  property in Gaza, all of a sudden, everybody's hunky dory. To your point, Maz, I don't know why [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1331.38s)]
*  Trump treats Putin like he's his best friend. But at the end there, we showed you a piece of it. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1336.74s)]
*  He made Putin look like the victim. He's like, poor me and Vlad, we've been through so much. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1341.78s)]
*  We went through the Russia Russia hoax and poor Vladimir and how he was treated by Biden and [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1346.8999999999999s)]
*  all this stuff. Now we don't say that. Guy now has invaded how many places? Georgia, Ukraine, [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1351.86s)]
*  Crimea. It goes on and on and on. And he's encroaching against our allies. And you make [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1358.1s)]
*  it seem like he's the victim, but Netanyahu is like the world's greatest guy. So I don't know [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1364.34s)]
*  who's funneling money to Trump or Elon Musk or to all these guys. But if you think that Trump and [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1369.9399999999998s)]
*  those guys don't care about their own personal well-being and their finances, you're unbelievably [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1376.02s)]
*  naive. So get to the American people's business. The American people don't care about your stupid [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1382.66s)]
*  company deals and whatever deals you have with Putin or Netanyahu or whoever's putting money into [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1390.74s)]
*  your stupid meme coin. We want peace and yelling like this in the Oval Office while you take away [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1396.9s)]
*  one piece of leverage from us after another, after another, after another. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1404.34s)]
*  Doesn't get you closer to peace. It gets you much, much further away from peace. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1407.9399999999998s)]
*  And so look, it's the last thing for me. If you wanna get to say, okay, you know what, [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1412.34s)]
*  we're tired of paying for this. We can debate that. And I think that's a legitimate conversation. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1418.5s)]
*  And I would say, hey, look, you're keep saying this is an existential threat. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1425.62s)]
*  They've given about the same amount we have, maybe a little bit more than us. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1429.3799999999999s)]
*  European Union is a little bit larger than us. Their GDP is a little bit lower than us. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1434.6599999999999s)]
*  But I can make an argument for the European Union carrying two-thirds of the load or three-quarters [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1438.34s)]
*  of the load here in this war. But that's about the American taxpayers. And we're not having that [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1442.4199999999998s)]
*  conversation. Instead, we're having a random conversation about lithium rights. This is crazy. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1448.6599999999999s)]
*  And this is not how you take care of the American people or world peace. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1454.8999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I think what stood out to me in that interaction was, first of all, [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1459.22s)]
*  it felt like a waste of energy because now that's gonna be the conversation, [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1463.86s)]
*  especially in right-wing circles. I think we can expect to see a lot of conversations [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1468.1s)]
*  and discussions, especially on social media, about who was in the right, who lacked decorum, [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1472.58s)]
*  who was behaving in a way that they shouldn't have been lacking, have been acting. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1478.18s)]
*  But at the end of the day, and Trump was the one who actually pointed this out, [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1482.1s)]
*  millions and millions of lives are at stake here. Millions and millions of lives are going to be [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1486.02s)]
*  affected in one way or another. So whatever these tantrums are that these big, strong men [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1489.94s)]
*  are having, that these rich, powerful men are having, they need to get over it. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1495.06s)]
*  Whatever ego, bruising they've endured here, they need to get over it because people are actually [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1498.82s)]
*  going to suffer on the ground. And here are just these people who are in a very cozy, [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1503.62s)]
*  comfortable office. And I'm not saying that Zelensky lives this way normally because usually, [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1509.3s)]
*  I know he is very involved in the war effort back home. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1514.82s)]
*  But it's easy for Trump to say something like, you're a little ungrateful, so you need to be [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1517.78s)]
*  careful because otherwise millions and millions of lives are gonna be affected. Coming from [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1523.46s)]
*  somebody like Trump that is so rich because he makes decisions impulsively at theme that do [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1527.54s)]
*  impact millions and millions of people right here at home and around the world, right? [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1534.26s)]
*  He has no problem doing that. He has no sense of responsibility to these people apart from the fact [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1538.34s)]
*  that he needs their loyalty. And so he's willing to throw them a bone every once in a while. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1544.58s)]
*  So this whole interaction feels more like it's just going to overwhelm the headlines and overtake [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1549.22s)]
*  the discussion regarding what happens as far as the United States relationship to Ukraine and to [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1556.4199999999998s)]
*  Russia and our role in whether or not we continue funding Ukraine and their defense against Russia [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1561.9399999999998s)]
*  or whatever. And again, coming from Trump, this is the guy who just said that he wants to make [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1568.74s)]
*  the Gaza Strip into some kind of luxury resort. He tweeted this weird AI video which featured him [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1574.26s)]
*  making a new Riviera in the Gaza Strip with a big Trump statue there. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1583.46s)]
*  That's that guy. He's not worried about the millions of lives of the Ukrainian people or [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1587.46s)]
*  the Russian people. And then to Cenk's point, yeah, this is all about resources. This is all [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1592.5s)]
*  about lithium. This is all about Elon Musk and his businesses. That's why we're involved in [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1597.86s)]
*  Greenland. That's why we're involved in Panama. That's the only reason why we're involved [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1602.58s)]
*  geopolitically anywhere in the world. And that is the case throughout history. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1606.82s)]
*  The United States loves to pretend that we go on these crusades around the world, [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1611.62s)]
*  protecting democracy here. But we are very selective over which conflicts we choose to [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1615.9399999999998s)]
*  get involved in. And there's a reason why some of these conflicts are deemed to be more important [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1621.3s)]
*  than others. Because some of them we have something to get out of and the other ones we just don't. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1625.9399999999998s)]
*  It's not worth it for us to get involved, regardless of how much we posture about [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1630.26s)]
*  what is the right thing to do. And we're the world's superheroes and we're the ones who are [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1635.46s)]
*  going to protect all these people. That's just the PR aspect of things. That is just the [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1639.14s)]
*  politicization of what is actually going on. And what's actually going on is going on [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1644.02s)]
*  is business and the business of warfare. And what that means is, as Maz put it, [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1649.22s)]
*  colonization, colonialism. And by the way, one other thing to keep in mind [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1654.74s)]
*  Zelensky was jet lagged. Now I don't know if you guys have ever flown to the other side of [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1660.26s)]
*  the world and got into a meeting, but you're grumpy. And so he's got a little more excuse [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1664.34s)]
*  to act out the way he did than little diaper wearing JD Vance. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1670.42s)]
*  And not just grumpy, but he's fighting a war at home, Trump is it? [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1675.7s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, he's like, I wake up for this. Why am I doing? Anyway, that's my impression. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1678.74s)]
*  Look, I think that he also was offended that they made it seem like the Ukrainian people [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1683.94s)]
*  fighting back against Russia was no big deal. And that it was all America, America. But I don't [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1693.3s)]
*  really guys, whether they were offended jet lagged, etc. I think there's some chance Zelensky [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1698.26s)]
*  was so frustrated by the fake pretenses with which they brought him here. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1704.8200000000002s)]
*  That he might have halfway consciously or subconsciously blown up this so called deal [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1710.34s)]
*  because he didn't want it. And because he doesn't want it. I mean, if you don't have security [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1719.06s)]
*  guarantees, why is he giving away hundreds of billions of dollars in natural resource of his [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1723.4599999999998s)]
*  country? And to be fair to Zelensky, if I was him, I wouldn't have taken that deal. That's crazy. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1727.4599999999998s)]
*  I mean, they tell you here, come on, we're gonna give you security guarantees, [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1732.98s)]
*  you give us the minerals. He gets here and he's like, they're like, just kidding. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1735.62s)]
*  Now we go into the office and take the deal. We want your minerals and we're not giving you [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1739.06s)]
*  any security guarantees. Well, what does he get out of that? I'd have blown up the deal too. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1742.74s)]
*  So Trump, Trump had said before, I don't know if you saw this, [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1748.02s)]
*  maybe a couple days ago. He said, yes, you'll have security because we'll be in Ukraine working [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1752.4199999999998s)]
*  with you for these minerals. So he was using the pretense that since we'll have our companies there, [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1760.1799999999998s)]
*  you'll be secure. But we all know that's not how it goes. If an actual thing were to happen where [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1767.94s)]
*  there'd be further attacks on Russia, all you do is you pull out your American employees and you [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1772.42s)]
*  leave them there without security guarantees, like you were saying, Cenk. So absolutely, [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1776.9s)]
*  he's in the right to not take the deal. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0zRnl1Pg4&t=1780.8200000000002s)]
