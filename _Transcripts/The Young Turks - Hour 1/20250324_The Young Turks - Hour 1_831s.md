TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.

TYT‚Äôs 24/7 programming is available on YouTube TV, Samsung TV, Plus, Roku, Xumo, TCLtv+, Fubo, and more.

TYT is also available as a podcast on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, TuneIn, Amazon Music, and more.

# Morning Joe's UNBELIEVABLE Take on AOC & Bernie's Rally Talk
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [March 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw)
*  The message Bernie Sanders and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=0.0s)]
*  AOC take that to McComb County. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=2.92s)]
*  And in the words of Hank Williams, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=7.34s)]
*  senior, you'd be set in the woods [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=9.74s)]
*  on fire. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=12.08s)]
*  I mean, that's a strong message [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=12.76s)]
*  that wins in places like McComb [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=15.0s)]
*  County. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  What in the world's going on? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=18.94s)]
*  Joe Scarborough praising Bernie [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=20.580000000000002s)]
*  Sanders and AOC and saying that [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=22.66s)]
*  they would win in the middle of [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=24.66s)]
*  the country? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=26.5s)]
*  That's from the network and [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=27.86s)]
*  the show in particular that has [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=29.62s)]
*  despised Bernie Sanders, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=31.46s)]
*  that has helped to defeat Bernie [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=33.14s)]
*  Sanders in 2016 and 2020. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=34.94s)]
*  And now all of a sudden they [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=36.58s)]
*  realize that maybe Bernie Sanders [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=38.18s)]
*  and AOC have the right message. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=40.02s)]
*  Wow, but hold, because there is [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=42.46s)]
*  going to be a member of the panel [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=44.06s)]
*  who is a giant corporatist who's [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=45.78s)]
*  going to tell us but [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=47.58s)]
*  don't ever do their policies. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=48.72s)]
*  To which I say, of course, but [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=50.620000000000005s)]
*  what are they praising here in [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=52.34s)]
*  the first place? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=53.980000000000004s)]
*  Well, I want to show you some clips [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=55.019999999999996s)]
*  of AOC in a sec. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=56.42s)]
*  If you haven't seen Bernie and [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=57.58s)]
*  AOC have been doing tour around [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=59.120000000000005s)]
*  the country where they're going [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=60.7s)]
*  getting really large crowds and [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=62.34s)]
*  actively putting forward a positive [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=64.1s)]
*  message for the Democratic Party [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=66.14s)]
*  saying here are the things that we [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=68.06s)]
*  should do. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=69.98s)]
*  Here's who we should fight against [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=71.18s)]
*  and here's what we should stand [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=72.78s)]
*  for. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=74.14s)]
*  I want to show you clips of that [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=74.64s)]
*  and react to it. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=75.82000000000001s)]
*  First, let's watch AOC. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=76.58s)]
*  We are witnessing an oligarchy [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=77.5s)]
*  in America. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=80.14s)]
*  And that is when those with the [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=81.54s)]
*  most epic and [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=83.58s)]
*  political and technological power [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=84.66000000000001s)]
*  destroy the public good to enrich [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=87.62s)]
*  themselves while millions of [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=90.42s)]
*  Americans pay the price. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=93.10000000000001s)]
*  And we are at a point where [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=95.46000000000001s)]
*  the wealthiest people in the world [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=97.9s)]
*  like Elon Musk and [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=101.14s)]
*  all the Republicans enabling him [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=103.02000000000001s)]
*  are turning to the other side of [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=106.34s)]
*  the world. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=109.5s)]
*  And we are at a point where [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=110.74000000000001s)]
*  are turning to loot what is left of [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=113.82000000000001s)]
*  Medicaid, Medicare and [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=116.98s)]
*  Social Security to bankroll even [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=119.46000000000001s)]
*  deeper tax cuts and [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=122.62s)]
*  sweetheart contracts for themselves, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=124.46000000000001s)]
*  their fellow billionaires and [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=127.86s)]
*  their corporations. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=130.46s)]
*  There we go, here, here. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=132.38s)]
*  Finally, economic populism. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=134.62s)]
*  This is exactly what we should be [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=137.98s)]
*  doing. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=139.5s)]
*  So you've seen me criticize AOC, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=140.3s)]
*  you've seen me give her credit. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=142.42s)]
*  Why do I do that? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=144.34s)]
*  I know that in the rest of [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=145.42s)]
*  the media world, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=146.54s)]
*  you either love someone or [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=147.29999999999998s)]
*  you hate someone, they're either [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=148.22s)]
*  100% right or 0% right. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=149.62s)]
*  No, we are fair on this show. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=151.38s)]
*  So when she's doing things that [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=153.85999999999999s)]
*  don't make sense, yes, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=155.82s)]
*  we criticize from time to time. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=157.22s)]
*  But here she is doing [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=158.94s)]
*  something great. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=159.85999999999999s)]
*  I like this a lot. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=161.1s)]
*  So first of all, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=161.82s)]
*  they're fighting the oligarchy and [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=162.42s)]
*  constantly pointing out the thing [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=163.9s)]
*  that should be pointed out. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=165.34s)]
*  Elon Musk is the top donor [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=166.78s)]
*  to Donald Trump. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=168.34s)]
*  Elon Musk is the top donor [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=169.18s)]
*  to Donald Trump. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=171.57999999999998s)]
*  He's a corporatist. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=172.34s)]
*  He wants corporate power. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=173.82s)]
*  Look, I'll add on top of it and [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=175.9s)]
*  they've been doing a great job on [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=177.45999999999998s)]
*  this tour. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=178.94s)]
*  But what are we doing? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=180.18s)]
*  Did we cut any oil subsidies? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=181.66s)]
*  Did we cut any defense contracts? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=183.45999999999998s)]
*  No, we didn't cut any of that. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=185.73999999999998s)]
*  Did we cut any corporate [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=186.82s)]
*  subsidies? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=187.82s)]
*  Did we cut subsidies to [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=188.29999999999998s)]
*  Elon Musk's companies? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=189.78s)]
*  No, we didn't do any of that. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=191.62s)]
*  So they cut from the people who can [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=193.38s)]
*  least afford it and [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=195.42s)]
*  they continue to give it in [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=196.73999999999998s)]
*  trillions of dollars to [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=198.5s)]
*  the giant corporations in this [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=200.22s)]
*  country. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=202.06s)]
*  And she is right, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=202.86s)]
*  they are looting Medicaid. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=204.02s)]
*  They're set to do about $800 [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=206.26000000000002s)]
*  billion in cuts in the committee [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=208.62s)]
*  that oversees Medicaid. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=211.18s)]
*  That's already in their budget [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=213.94s)]
*  proposal that has passed the House. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=215.82s)]
*  And so that is the Republican plan. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=218.3s)]
*  By the way, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=220.18s)]
*  are they going to cut defense? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=220.74s)]
*  No, they're going to add $100 [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=221.66s)]
*  billion to the defense. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=223.18s)]
*  So look guys, asking them to cut [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=224.86s)]
*  defense and having them agree, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=227.18s)]

*  Why? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=256.62s)]

*  $1.5 trillion in tax cuts to the [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=259.22s)]

*  the drug companies. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=307.82000000000005s)]

*  the voters do. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=314.22s)]

*  Zero. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=316.5s)]
*  So far, what has Trump and [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=317.74s)]

*  Zero. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=320.94s)]
*  So they're going to cut from you, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=322.18s)]

*  the corporate loot. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=325.82s)]

*  Fox News and the right wing will [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=328.38s)]

*  That we believe these things [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=337.42s)]

*  labor, and human dignity, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=349.26s)]
*  because I'm a Marxist. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=350.94s)]
*  I believe it because I was [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=352.66s)]
*  a waitress. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=354.1s)]

*  mom to go to school. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=358.22s)]

*  to keep the lights on. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=362.66s)]

*  89% of course saying that it's [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=392.78s)]
*  good. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=394.17999999999995s)]
*  But I was surprised that morning [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=394.7s)]
*  Joe was in favor of it. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=396.26s)]
*  But hold, hold, because are they [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=397.17999999999995s)]
*  really going to do this? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=399.78s)]
*  because if the Democratic Party [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=402.5s)]
*  talks a good game, but [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=403.82s)]
*  when it comes to actually taking [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=404.90000000000003s)]
*  action, that's where they fall [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=406.90000000000003s)]
*  massively short. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=408.98s)]
*  So is Steve Ratner, someone who was [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=410.18s)]
*  involved in the Obama [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=412.22s)]

*  the banking community? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=416.62s)]

*  good. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=419.94s)]

*  I think everything Sanders and [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=424.3s)]
*  AOC are saying is fine. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=426.38s)]
*  But then you get to the policies. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=428.3s)]
*  Do we really want to go back to [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=430.58000000000004s)]
*  Medicare for All, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=432.06s)]

*  women playing men's sports [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=435.9s)]
*  potentially? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=437.78s)]
*  Do we really want that's where I [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=439.14s)]
*  think ultimately we lost because [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=440.73999999999995s)]
*  those people who make less than [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=442.41999999999996s)]
*  $50,000 a year couldn't relate to [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=444.08s)]

*  See guys, look, I know that there's [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=450.06s)]

*  in particular and others should [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=455.09999999999997s)]

*  between far left and [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=459.46s)]
*  populist left, economic populism, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=460.96s)]
*  and identity politics. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=464.53999999999996s)]
*  And I know some of the left hate [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=465.94s)]
*  that distinction, and [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=467.53999999999996s)]
*  they don't want that distinction. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=468.7s)]
*  They think it's an internal fight, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=470.46s)]
*  we don't need it, and we should all [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=472.34s)]

*  a position as you could possibly [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=476.18s)]

*  Medicare for all, and also [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=492.26s)]
*  incredibly by the way, which is [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=493.94s)]
*  a very, very popular policy, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=495.85999999999996s)]
*  oftentimes pulling around 70%, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=497.62s)]

*  higher minimum wage pulling at 67%, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=502.06s)]
*  all these enormously popular [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=504.53999999999996s)]
*  policies with defund the police and [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=506.41999999999996s)]
*  trans women playing in professional [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=508.94s)]

*  it, they're all unpopular. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=513.74s)]
*  No, that's not true. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=515.86s)]
*  So the economic policies are [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=517.06s)]
*  enormously popular. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=518.9s)]
*  That's why Bernie and [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=520.98s)]
*  AOC are lighting up the country [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=522.0200000000001s)]

*  desperate for that kind of talk, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=525.3800000000001s)]
*  they're desperate for those [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=527.0200000000001s)]
*  policies. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=528.3800000000001s)]
*  Yes, unfortunately, defund the [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=528.98s)]
*  police, etc, are unpopular policies. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=530.5400000000001s)]
*  Now, I happen not agree with them [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=532.62s)]
*  in the first place, so [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=534.0600000000001s)]
*  it's easier for me. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=535.0600000000001s)]
*  But guys, they're going to try to [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=536.4200000000001s)]
*  put that albatross around our neck. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=538.2600000000001s)]
*  And that is why it's super clear to [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=540.2600000000001s)]
*  delineate, what does it mean to be [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=542.3800000000001s)]
*  progressive? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=544.5400000000001s)]
*  What does it mean to be on the left? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=545.5400000000001s)]
*  Who speaks for the left? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=546.9000000000001s)]
*  So that's why I keep saying, look, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=548.5400000000001s)]
*  I'm on the side of Bernie Sanders, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=549.86s)]
*  Ro Khanna, etc. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=551.4200000000001s)]
*  When they're talking about [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=552.62s)]
*  the core issues that we care about [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=554.1s)]
*  that are going to make everyone in [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=556.0600000000001s)]
*  this country better off, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=558.0600000000001s)]
*  every single person. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=559.5s)]
*  That's what we have to fight for. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=561.62s)]
*  What identity politics and [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=562.74s)]
*  culture wars do is they divide us. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=564.1s)]
*  They help the Republicans create [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=566.22s)]
*  a wedge between us. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=568.22s)]
*  That's why they're called wedge [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=569.62s)]
*  issues. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=571.1s)]
*  So don't let them do that. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=571.62s)]
*  Even if you don't agree with me and [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=573.46s)]
*  you want maximalist positions or [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=575.0200000000001s)]
*  whatever you want on the left side, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=576.58s)]
*  you have to make that distinction. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=578.42s)]
*  because if you don't, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=580.46s)]
*  they're going to say, yeah, paid [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=581.42s)]
*  family leave, Medicare for all. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=583.1s)]
*  All these issues are so unpopular [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=584.58s)]
*  because they're quote unquote [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=586.62s)]
*  far left. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=588.58s)]
*  No, those are populist left. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=589.3s)]
*  Those are, yes, we're under [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=591.18s)]
*  the same umbrella progressive, but [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=592.62s)]
*  that distinction makes a giant, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=594.54s)]
*  giant, giant difference. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=596.26s)]
*  One side is super popular and [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=597.7s)]
*  must get done on behalf of all [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=599.5s)]
*  Americans, and [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=601.3s)]
*  the other side is not popular. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=602.5s)]
*  And it's not protecting minorities, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=604.9s)]
*  both the right wing and [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=607.9s)]
*  the left wing, I feel like are or [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=609.18s)]
*  the far left and the far right are [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=611.02s)]
*  almost working together. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=612.86s)]
*  No, look, do we need to protect [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=614.6999999999999s)]
*  minorities? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=616.42s)]
*  Of course, do we need to protect [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=617.3s)]
*  Muslims and trans people, etc.? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=618.86s)]
*  Of course, of course. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=620.42s)]
*  But defunding the police does not [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=622.66s)]
*  equal protecting minorities. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=625.3s)]
*  How do I know that? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=628.0999999999999s)]
*  First of all, I know because by [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=628.6999999999999s)]
*  definition, there's a giant [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=630.2199999999999s)]
*  disagreement on how you protect [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=631.78s)]
*  minorities. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=633.42s)]
*  But minorities have spoken out [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=634.66s)]
*  about this. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=636.02s)]
*  Liberals and leftists and [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=636.5799999999999s)]
*  Democrats have all spoken out [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=638.14s)]
*  through the ballot box. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=640.02s)]
*  So when you have places like New [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=642.02s)]
*  York, San Francisco, Washington, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=643.66s)]
*  DC, Portland, Seattle, Oakland, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=645.5799999999999s)]
*  saying we don't want to defund [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=647.5799999999999s)]
*  the police, and they're voting in [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=649.26s)]
*  that direction. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=651.06s)]
*  Oakland, again, I keep pointing [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=652.06s)]
*  this out because it's so telling. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=653.66s)]
*  Black and brown communities, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=655.18s)]
*  middle class and poor communities, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=656.74s)]
*  all saying together, no, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=658.66s)]
*  we don't want decriminalization. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=660.06s)]
*  They voted 65 to 35 to oust their [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=662.54s)]
*  mayor that was going in there. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=665.98s)]
*  Perceive that way, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=668.86s)]
*  according to their perception, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=669.9399999999999s)]
*  that she was going in that [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=671.98s)]
*  direction. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=673.54s)]
*  So guys, that's why we cannot get [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=674.66s)]
*  stuck with the unpopular positions [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=677.3399999999999s)]
*  that actual Democratic voters, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=680.26s)]
*  black and brown voters do not want. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=682.74s)]
*  It's not just the Republicans [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=686.02s)]
*  don't want them, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=687.02s)]
*  the independents don't want them, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=687.54s)]
*  Democratic voters don't want them. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=688.9s)]
*  On the other hand, we have these [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=690.9s)]
*  golden economic policies that [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=692.74s)]
*  the country is desperate for. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=694.66s)]
*  And what are they going to do here? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=696.42s)]
*  One more from Steve Ratner about, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=697.5s)]
*  I mean, like, yeah, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=699.34s)]
*  the talk is fine and we could give [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=700.38s)]
*  them a little pat on the head, but [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=701.98s)]
*  we're not going to do any of [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=703.66s)]
*  their policies. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=704.9s)]
*  So whose policies should we do? [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=705.74s)]
*  Of course, he picks a very [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=707.66s)]
*  conservative corporatist Democrat, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=709.18s)]
*  watch. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=711.46s)]
*  The rhetoric is great about [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=712.26s)]
*  Donald Trump, but then you get to [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=713.62s)]
*  the policies and Alyssa Slotkin is [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=715.46s)]
*  speaking, I think, more the reality [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=717.42s)]
*  of what we have to do as a party. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=719.62s)]
*  Of course, so what do they do? [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=722.14s)]
*  They say, nice job, Bernie and AOC. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=724.78s)]
*  Yeah, good way to get [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=727.22s)]
*  the voters back, get them all back. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=728.0600000000001s)]
*  But we're not going to do those [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=729.94s)]
*  policies, we're going to do [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=731.38s)]
*  Slotnik's policies. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=732.5400000000001s)]
*  That's pro military industrial [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=733.94s)]
*  complex, big pharma, and [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=735.94s)]
*  all the corporations that are their [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=737.62s)]
*  donors that are robbing us blind. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=739.78s)]
*  Look, later, we have another story [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=742.22s)]
*  about Bernie, and again, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=745.0600000000001s)]
*  he's so reluctant to call out his [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=747.26s)]
*  own side. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=750.54s)]
*  And just a mere mention of calling [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=751.9s)]
*  out his Democratic colleagues, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=754.38s)]
*  sends him to want to leave [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=756.9s)]
*  an interview. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=758.8199999999999s)]
*  And it drives me crazy. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=760.14s)]
*  But look, again, you can criticize [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=761.8199999999999s)]
*  and give credit at the same time, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=763.8599999999999s)]
*  depending on what they're doing and [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=765.7399999999999s)]
*  what their actions are. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=767.6999999999999s)]
*  So Bernie and AOC overall, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=769.06s)]
*  I love this tour, keep it going. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=770.9s)]
*  And not only fight for [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=773.7399999999999s)]
*  the rhetoric, but fight for [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=774.9s)]
*  the policies, which is exactly what [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=776.38s)]
*  they're doing. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=778.38s)]
*  And don't be fooled by the rhetoric [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=779.3s)]
*  of mainstream media and MSNBC, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=781.54s)]
*  pretending they're on our side. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=783.58s)]
*  At the end of the day, for [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=785.62s)]
*  the next Bernie, for the next AOC, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=786.98s)]
*  no one will fight them harder than [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=788.9399999999999s)]
*  MSNBC and Morning Joe. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=790.8199999999999s)]
*  And I guarantee you, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=792.38s)]
*  if Morning Joe was supporting [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=793.5s)]
*  a populist candidate in [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=794.98s)]
*  the Democratic primaries, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=796.1s)]
*  I would be shocked. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=797.66s)]
*  I would fall out of this chair. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=799.22s)]
*  It's never going to happen. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=800.66s)]
*  Instead, what they're going to do [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=801.74s)]
*  is, well, I mean, I'm glad they [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=803.14s)]
*  brought the voters back in, but [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=804.5s)]
*  we're not really going to do these [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=805.9399999999999s)]
*  far left policies. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=807.46s)]
*  They're all defund the police and [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=808.42s)]
*  transit, etc. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=809.98s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=810.9399999999999s)]
*  keep the corporate gravy train [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=812.28s)]
*  going. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=813.74s)]
*  No, don't keep the corporate [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=814.26s)]
*  gravy chain going. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=815.98s)]
*  Instead, fight back for [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=817.5s)]
*  the average American. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=818.9s)]
*  That's what the populist left needs [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=820.34s)]
*  to do, and I love that Bernie and [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=821.9s)]
*  AOC are doing it. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=823.38s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=824.38s)]
*  an angel gets his wings. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=826.1s)]
*  Totally not true, but it does keep [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=827.46s)]
*  you updated on our live shows. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dovK7EHBCvw&t=828.98s)]
