"After winning the Oscar for Best Documentary at the 97th Annual Academy Awards on ABC Sunday, the creators of the film ‚ÄúNo Other Land‚Äù spoke out on Israel and Palestine in one of the few politically charged moments of the evening as they called for an end to ‚Äúethnic cleansing‚Äù and said that the United States ‚Äúblocks the path‚Äù to a peaceful coexistence between Palestine and Israel."*

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

# "No Other Land" Oscar Winners Give POWERFUL Acceptance Speech
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [March 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM)
*  A thousand Palestinians face one of the single biggest expulsion decisions since the Israeli [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=0.0s)]
*  occupation of the Palestinian territories began in 1967. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=9.96s)]
*  No Other Land, a documentary filmed before the October 7 attacks in Israel about a community [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  in the West Bank facing ongoing violence, of course, from Israeli settlers and the IDF won [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=29.06s)]
*  the Oscar for best documentary last night. Now it was created by Palestinian activist [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=35.78s)]
*  Basel Adra and Israeli filmmaker and journalist Yuval Abraham, who spoke out against ethnic [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=42.42s)]
*  cleansing of Palestinians during their acceptance speech, which I'm about to read a little [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=50.26s)]
*  for you in just a moment. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=55.940000000000005s)]
*  But Cenk, it is notable that this is the film that won best documentary considering the [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=57.940000000000005s)]
*  fact that there were so many production companies in the United States who ran away from this film, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=63.940000000000005s)]
*  terrified of working on it in any way. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=68.10000000000001s)]
*  Well, it speaks well of the Academy, by the way, that they did vote for this for the Oscar. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=71.14s)]
*  So that's great. They had a great speech. We're gonna tell you about that. And then, of course, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=76.34s)]
*  Israel now ending the ceasefire and going back to annihilating the people of Gaza. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=80.5s)]
*  We have more on that as well. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=85.38s)]
*  So, Adra, the Palestinian subject of the movie told the audience during the acceptance speech [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=86.5s)]
*  that about two months ago, I became a father and my hope to my daughter is that she will not have [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=93.3s)]
*  to live the same life I am living now, always fearing settlers violence, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=101.14s)]
*  home demolitions and forceful displacements that my community, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=105.94s)]
*  Masafir Yatta is living and facing every day under the Israeli occupation. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=110.25999999999999s)]
*  No other land reflects the harsh reality that we have been enduring for decades and still resist [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=115.38s)]
*  as we call on the world to take serious actions to stop the injustice and to stop the ethnic [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=121.94s)]
*  cleansing of Palestinian people. So then Israeli filmmaker Yuval Abraham doubled down saying this. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=127.46s)]
*  We made this film, Palestinians and Israelis, because together our voices are stronger. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=138.42s)]
*  We see each other, the atrocious destruction of Gaza and its people, which must end. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=145.06s)]
*  The Israeli hostages brutally taken in the crime of October 7th, which must be freed. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=151.3s)]
*  When I look at Basil, I see my brother, but we are unequal. We live in a regime [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=160.02s)]
*  where I'm free under civilian law and he is under military laws that destroy his life and he cannot [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=167.14s)]
*  control. There is a different path, a political solution without ethnic supremacy with national [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=173.62s)]
*  rights for both of our people. And I have to say, as I am here, the foreign policy in this country, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=180.5s)]
*  meaning the United States, of course, is helping to block this path. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=186.74s)]
*  And you know why? Can't you see that we are intertwined? That my people can be truly safe [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=190.9s)]
*  if Basil's people are truly free and safe. There is another way. It's not too late for life, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=198.66s)]
*  for the living. There is no other way. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=204.98s)]
*  Yeah, so I love that they got together, Palestinians and Israelis made this movie. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=208.1s)]
*  It's a powerful movie and I like that they're both speaking out on behalf of [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=215.29999999999998s)]
*  peace and not just the Palestinians. But to Yuval's point, peace is going to make Israel safer and [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=220.42s)]
*  better as well. So guys were blinded at this point by rage for each other. It's true in America, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=228.18s)]
*  between the left wing and the right wing, we just can't see past our hatred for one another. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=234.34s)]
*  It's true way more so between the Israelis and the Palestinians. When the rest of us look at them, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=239.38s)]
*  they look nearly identical, right? And I mean, those two sets of people are so similar, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=244.18s)]
*  having been neighbors for so long. And they're just killing each, well, one side is killing a [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=251.94s)]
*  little bit, the other side is killing a lot and taking their land and doing all the terrible [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=257.22s)]
*  things that they're doing. But I've never had any hatred in my heart for the people of Israel. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=262.1s)]
*  And because oftentimes it's Israelis, it's Jewish Americans, etc, that are the best fighters for [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=267.78000000000003s)]
*  peace. And this isn't about hatred. This is about getting rid of hatred. If all you do is, you get [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=273.54s)]
*  to a deal where both sides still have that hatred for each other, it's just gonna blow up again and [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=279.3s)]
*  again and again. So we've got to get to peace with decent, wonderful people like this. I wish they [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=283.54s)]
*  were in charge, instead of the monsters that run our government, the Israeli government, Hamas, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=288.1s)]
*  etc. Now, Egypt and Qatar are accusing Israel of blocking humanitarian aid into Gaza now that they [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=293.78000000000003s)]
*  have decided that we've gotten our hostages back. We don't really care about a ceasefire anymore. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=302.02000000000004s)]
*  And we're gonna continue slaughtering innocent people in Gaza. So they have now started to block [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=306.42s)]
*  humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip again. Mediators, Egypt and Qatar, accuse Israel [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=311.38s)]
*  violating humanitarian law as if they care about humanitarian law by using starvation as a weapon. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=316.34s)]
*  Again, a weapon against innocent people who haven't done anything wrong other than the [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=322.97999999999996s)]
*  fact that they were born into a terrible situation in Gaza. The ceasefire's first [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=327.06s)]
*  phase, according to the Associated Press, saw a surge in humanitarian aid after months of growing [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=332.65999999999997s)]
*  hunger. Now, the Palestinian people are likely going to suffer more and more deaths as a result [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=336.97999999999996s)]
*  of malnutrition, thirst and the like. So that's where we're currently at. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=344.02s)]
*  So they're not just starting the bombing campaign again, they're blocking humanitarian aid. So [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=348.58s)]
*  they're going back to starving the Palestinians to death. The most moral army, come on. I mean, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=355.21999999999997s)]
*  you'd have to be the most biased person on the entire planet to believe that. At least [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=361.38s)]
*  Stefanic, our new useless ambassador to the United Nations, I mean, to be fair, she's not useless. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=365.53999999999996s)]
*  She serves Israel well. When gave a speech at the ADL saying that the UN is a toxic, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=370.74s)]
*  terrible place. The place she's going to go serve and represent us. Why? Because it's a deep well of [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=377.3s)]
*  anti-Semites. The whole world isn't bothered by Israel's non-stop war crimes and their complete [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=383.3s)]
*  disregard for international law. And how their own representative shredded his UN badge at the UN while [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=390.34000000000003s)]
*  speaking there, spitting in the face of the whole world. No, they're not bothered by all that [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=397.62s)]
*  law breaking. They just hate Jews. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No one believes that crap [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=402.42s)]
*  anymore other than the people in power in America because they want to believe it. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=409.22s)]
*  Look, I'm going to read the New York Times quote on this. Despite a string of honors and rave reviews, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=413.7s)]
*  as Anna referred to earlier, no distributor would pick up this film in the United States, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=419.06s)]
*  making it nearly impossible for the American film goers to see it in theaters or to stream it. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=424.74s)]
*  Okay, remember, they say, anti-Semitism. It has a Jewish director from Israel, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=429.94s)]
*  as well as a Palestinian director. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=435.62s)]
*  I know, but he's not doing the bidding of the extreme far-right government of Israel. So sorry. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=437.06s)]
*  Exactly. So this has nothing to do with religion, guys. Do not hate the Jews, do not hate the Muslims, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=441.86s)]
*  do not hate anyone. And understand when they say anti-Semitism. It's not, I know a lot of people [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=447.22s)]
*  genuinely believe that. And I know there is genuine anti-Semitism. But when it comes to Israel, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=454.66s)]
*  it's a super cheap, dirty trick to make sure that you never, ever criticize Israel. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=459.14000000000004s)]
*  And you never see any bad critique of Israel, any real movies, any real facts about Israel. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=465.94s)]
*  It has nothing to do with protecting Jews. It has everything to do with protecting this [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=472.1s)]
*  foreign government that at this point has committed 60 times the terrorism of Hamas. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=477.06s)]
*  If you're 60 times worse than Hamas, the problem isn't the rest of the world being irrationally [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=484.5s)]
*  mad at you. The problem is that you are irrationally driven by hatred towards Palestinians and wanting [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=490.18s)]
*  to take their land. And the world is rationally upset at you. But no, no, keep calling everybody [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=497.46s)]
*  an anti-Semite, which by the way is another word for racist and bigot. So the whole world is racist [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=503.94s)]
*  against Israel, not because Israel's ever done anything wrong. You'd have to be a near lunatic [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=509.46s)]
*  to believe that, like our UN ambassador. Of course, she's not, she's just corrupt and she's [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=514.02s)]
*  counting her money as we speak. A pack, give me more money. That's how all these loser politicians [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=518.18s)]
*  are, impotent buffoons serving a different country. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=524.8199999999999s)]
*  Well said. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTPoPzAzBNM&t=528.5s)]
