TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.
The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.
On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.
Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.
Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.
TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

# MSNBC, Fox, CNN, SALIVATE Over Trump's Airstrikes On Iran
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8)
*  We just kicked their ass. We just took out what they've spent 40 years trying to build. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=0.0s)]
*  I think progressives underestimate how dangerous Iran is. We cannot have a nuclear armed Iran. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=4.16s)]
*  I find it hard to believe that Bush 41, Bush 43, Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=12.16s)]
*  go down the list. Any presidents wouldn't have felt compelled to take that strike. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=19.6s)]
*  Doesn't matter what you were listening to or what you were watching this weekend. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=28.240000000000002s)]
*  You just watched three separate clips from CNN, MSNBC and Fox News. And in every single one of [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=31.44s)]
*  them, they were cheerleading for the military strikes that the United States carried out [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=37.2s)]
*  against Iran's nuclear sites. This again happened over the weekend, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=43.04s)]
*  could drag us into a prolonged war. Trump over the weekend also hinted that he might be open [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=48.08s)]
*  to regime change. Although today, he announced that Iran and Israel agreed to a ceasefire. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=53.12s)]
*  Neither party, as I speak right now, has commented on that. So I do question if there really is a [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=61.68s)]
*  ceasefire. But go ahead. Okay, so look, I love that clip and I wanted to show it to you guys why. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=67.03999999999999s)]
*  We've told you a hundred times on this show. They're playing good cop, bad cop on us. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=72.96s)]
*  Both establishment Democrats and establishment Republicans. The Republicans are the bad guys. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=77.84s)]
*  But the Democrats come and go, there was nothing we could do, right? So same exact thing for MSNBC, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=82.4s)]
*  Fox News. Good cop, bad cop. And we all hate Trump. Trump on MSNBC. He did a war. We love that war. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=88.24000000000001s)]
*  We got more videos coming. We got more videos coming. Wars, great. The donors are super happy. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=96.0s)]
*  Military industrial complex, the oil companies, APAC, they're all thrilled. Everybody get out [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=101.60000000000001s)]
*  there. Now you all love Trump, right? So whenever it's an economic issue that affects the donor [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=106.4s)]
*  class, all three cable news stations rally. And it doesn't matter which side it's on. No, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=111.36s)]
*  and they got their pom poms and they're all cheerleading for it. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=118.08s)]
*  Of all those guys we just showed you, the one I'm most disappointed in is Van Jones. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=121.36s)]
*  So Van Jones tried to make an argument for how progressives should be like the neocons and be in [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=125.68s)]
*  favor of attacking Iran. You must be out of your goddamn mind. No, no progressive is interested [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=132.07999999999998s)]
*  in starting a war for Israel. No matter how much you say that on TV. I don't know who the hell is [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=139.04s)]
*  paying you to say that. But if you actually believe that, then I feel even worse for you. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=144.56s)]
*  What a ludicrous thing to think. But we'll give you the clips. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=150.0s)]
*  So let's go through each of those three channels one by one. So let's start with Fox News, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=152.56s)]
*  for instance. By the way, Fox News has been wall to wall, war, war, war, war, war, war, coverage, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=157.76s)]
*  endless. I mean, it's so reminiscent of the lead up to the war in Iraq. But nonetheless, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=164.96s)]
*  Fox is especially important because as we've covered, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=169.44s)]
*  President Donald Trump watches Fox News incessantly. It's still his favorite [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=174.08s)]
*  programming to watch. And they have been kind of egging Trump on in carrying out the strikes [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=178.72s)]
*  that he did carry out over the weekend. So let's take a look at some of their coverage. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=184.72s)]
*  We just kicked their ass. We just took out what they've spent 40 years trying to build [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=188.48s)]
*  and hundreds of billions of dollars with the help of the North Koreans, the Chinese and the [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=192.79999999999998s)]
*  Russians and anybody else they can get. Donald Trump understood with moral clarity, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=196.24s)]
*  as Prime Minister Netanyahu did, that there is good and evil. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=201.44s)]
*  And that it is better if you apply common sense to just come to the simple conclusion [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=205.44s)]
*  that the number one state sponsor of terror cannot have nuclear weapons. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=211.12s)]
*  They have no value for human life. There's a very small but vocal faction within the GOP, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=215.68s)]
*  which seems to want to live comfortably now between a couple of oceans and friendly neighbors. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=222.0s)]
*  And let the rest of the world fend for itself. I mean, morally or politically, what's the use [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=227.76000000000002s)]
*  of being strong and powerful if you don't or won't protect your friends and allies and democracy? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=234.16s)]
*  Every dictator in the world is on notice now. The world is a safer place tonight, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=239.68s)]
*  is my conclusion. What's yours? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=244.16s)]
*  I couldn't agree more, Sean. God bless President Trump. God bless the US military and God bless [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=245.52s)]
*  the Israelis for paving the way so this mission could be as successful as it was. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=250.8s)]
*  And if the Nobel Peace Prize were worth anything anymore, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=255.44s)]
*  I would say the president certainly deserves one. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=258.4s)]
*  So all of the coverage on Fox News sounds like that. You're not going to hear a differing opinion [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=260.48s)]
*  at all. In fact, I got a little taste of what it's like when you happen to be one of the few [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=265.68s)]
*  people who's willing to give a different opinion in the media. There will be a [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=271.04s)]
*  total campaign to ban you from the network. Getting a little taste of that right now, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=277.36s)]
*  Cenk, but go ahead. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=281.92s)]
*  Okay, so real quick on that. So you're not surprised that Fox is doing propaganda for more war. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=282.8s)]
*  And of course, war on behalf of Israel, not America. They did not have a nuke. They had no [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=289.92s)]
*  reason to attack us. They're not our enemy, they're Israel's enemy. And [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=295.20000000000005s)]
*  all this talk of them having a nuke is just nothing but giant lies. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=299.91999999999996s)]
*  Okay, so that you know. But they have an audience of two sets of people there. One is they're trying [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=303.52s)]
*  to manipulate all the 70 year olds watching Fox News. Yeah, we said anti-war, but I think [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=308.79999999999995s)]
*  anti meant pro. Yeah, yeah, yeah, we meant we're pro-war. Okay, super easy to influence them and [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=314.08s)]
*  bring those sheep over to the pro-war category. They've been there before. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=319.84s)]
*  They've been- And Fox News got them there before, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=323.11999999999995s)]
*  easy to get them there. But then the top 70 year old that they're targeting is Donald Trump, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=325.68s)]
*  who's in his 70s. And they're like, you kicked ass Donald Trump. The way to do, you be super strong. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=330.96s)]
*  If you're strong, you start wars for Israel. Yeah, I had a boy and he's listening like an idiot. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=338.64s)]
*  And we know New York Times reported that he got very influenced when Israel did a bombing [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=344.32s)]
*  campaign of Iraq. I'm sorry, Iran, but hey, same thing. In their minds, this is just a replay of [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=350.72s)]
*  the Iraq war, same propaganda. So when Israel did the bombing of Iran, Fox News on purpose went on [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=356.64000000000004s)]
*  there and said, it was amazing. It was so strong. It was so brilliant. And Trump got all goosed up [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=362.08000000000004s)]
*  by that. And he's like, yeah, I wanna be strong and brilliant. I can bomb them too. So they're [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=368.08000000000004s)]
*  trying to manipulate him. So did you notice the lady at the end though? He should get a Nobel [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=372.8s)]
*  Peace Prize for starting a war. There's no end to the propaganda. There are no bounds. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=377.68s)]
*  Now Fox News, of course, is the right wing cable news channel. MSNBC is thought of as the cable [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=384.32s)]
*  news channel that provides a cover for the Democratic Party. And oftentimes, actually all [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=391.92s)]
*  of the time, they're very critical of Donald Trump. Not so in their recent coverage. You'll [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=396.72s)]
*  notice a change in their tone. Let's take a look. The level of secrecy of this mission. The fact [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=402.88s)]
*  that you had planes that flew from the continental United States. From Missouri. From Missouri and [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=409.52s)]
*  flew for, I think you said, 18 hours with multiple refueling in the air. All of that, to me, is just [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=415.2s)]
*  on from what they're telling us, is rather impressive. There's one thing I'll agree with [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=422.96s)]
*  Secretary Hexathon and others here. This was a tremendous success for what it was. It [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=428.4s)]
*  probably took weeks and weeks and weeks of planning. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=435.28s)]
*  So the president had no good options. What would Monday look like if he hadn't have moved? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=437.59999999999997s)]
*  If Iran wasn't already at 60% and an ability to create nuclear weapons [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=445.44s)]
*  in a short matter of time, right? I find it hard to believe that Bush 41, Bush 43, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=458.40000000000003s)]
*  Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, go down the list. Any presidents wouldn't have felt [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=464.0s)]
*  compelled to take that strike. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=473.28s)]
*  I mean, I'm not surprised. None of this is surprising to me. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=475.36s)]
*  I'm so blackpilled on the media. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=480.4s)]
*  Yeah, here we go. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=481.91999999999996s)]
*  The love for war, it's endless. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=483.2s)]
*  So Scarborough just said there, this is the same thing George W Bush and Hillary Clinton [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=485.91999999999996s)]
*  would have done. Well, that might be true. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=490.4s)]
*  That is true, yes. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=492.24s)]
*  So, Magga, you must be so proud. Trump is just like Hillary Clinton and George W Bush, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=493.28s)]
*  getting us into a giant war in the Middle East. And now Joe Scarborough is praising him and all [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=499.92s)]
*  of MSNBC is praising him. The unit party is back. You must be so proud. War is back. You must be so [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=504.72s)]
*  proud of Donald Trump. Okay, and then did you see the same guys who before like, oh, Heges shouldn't [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=511.04s)]
*  be the defensive here. Now like, well, we have to give a lot of credit to Secretary Heges. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=517.2s)]
*  I mean, starting a war on behalf of Israel is a genius move to do. Everybody agrees, MSNBC agrees, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=522.5600000000001s)]
*  Fox News agrees. And then you see, it was so impressive. What a tremendous success. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=528.16s)]
*  They're all doing this so that if Donald Trump is watching, he's like, it was a tremendous success. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=534.16s)]
*  I should bomb again for Israel, right? So guys, is it Trump's success that our military [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=539.76s)]
*  has technology that is way past Iran's and that we have B2 stealth bombers? They make it seem like [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=550.24s)]
*  Trump did it. And we're principled and honest here. I said the same exact thing when Obama was [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=557.2s)]
*  president. And they all made it seem like Obama went on the mission to kill bin Laden. I was like, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=562.32s)]
*  and he gave the go ahead order. I'm like, yeah, that's the easy part. Going to kill bin Laden is [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=567.36s)]
*  the hard part. They make it always seem like this grand hero thing to the presidents when they go, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=572.72s)]
*  okay, go ahead, right? No, like this, and our air superiority to Iran's and our weapons superiority [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=577.76s)]
*  to Iran is so gigantic. It's like we're squashing them with a giant boulder and [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=586.0s)]
*  they're a tiny little thing. And then all these propagandists go all over cable news goes, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=593.2s)]
*  brilliant, no one could have done it. It was so hard. It was so hard. But the brilliant genius, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=597.92s)]
*  Donald Trump, who we just told you like yesterday was evil and a fascist and a Nazi, is now the [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=604.08s)]
*  greatest person in the world because he started a war that Israel wants. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=609.92s)]
*  So we'll end with CNN. Same crap, different network. Take a look. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=615.2800000000001s)]
*  Well, I'm fascinated and candidly I'm impressed. I think the use of deception [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=620.6400000000001s)]
*  and trickery in this case, first of all, was successful. But second of all, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=626.08s)]
*  saved the potential loss of American lives. I think progressives underestimate [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=630.1600000000001s)]
*  how dangerous Iran is. Iran is not a normal country. Normal countries don't [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=636.24s)]
*  blind women because they showed some hair. They don't empower little gangs and proxies [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=644.48s)]
*  to surround a country and fire rockets and rape people. The question though is the who and how. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=650.96s)]
*  Is Israel gonna take out this nuclear capacity by dropping people there who blow it up? Or is [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=656.8s)]
*  America gonna take it out by dropping a bomb that blows it up? But the what and the why are clear, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=663.44s)]
*  and I think progressives should get on board with that. We cannot have a nuclear armed Iran. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=668.24s)]
*  I'll just comment on the first individual you heard comment on CNN. So he was kind of celebrating [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=672.8000000000001s)]
*  the Trump administration's trickery and deception. What he's referring to is the fact that publicly [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=681.44s)]
*  Trump claimed that he wanted Iran to have a seat at the table with him and sign a nuclear deal. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=687.68s)]
*  He claimed he wanted to engage in diplomatic means. He said that he was going to make a decision [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=694.4s)]
*  within two weeks and then a day later, he carried out the strikes. Which could very likely drag the [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=700.2399999999999s)]
*  United States into a prolonged war. We have to wait and see what's gonna happen. But the fallout [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=708.2399999999999s)]
*  and the blowback from that is a huge problem. The other thing that's a huge problem is once you have [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=715.76s)]
*  an American president pretend like he's gonna engage in diplomacy and then immediately do these [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=720.72s)]
*  strikes. Well, that just destroys any chance of diplomacy in the future. Why would any other [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=726.64s)]
*  government, any other regime trust the United States government when they claim that they want [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=732.96s)]
*  to engage in diplomatic negotiations? [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=738.64s)]
*  Yeah, so that first general, CNN didn't disclose it. There was a general on MSNBC. They didn't [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=740.96s)]
*  disclose where they're working, but I would be shocked if they weren't working for defense [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=747.84s)]
*  contractors. But they never revealed that. And every general that comes out is always pro-war, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=751.28s)]
*  about 98% of the time. So they're like, this is impressive way to start a war that I will [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=758.24s)]
*  personally profit from. In that case, I don't know for sure. We've done it before. Every time [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=764.48s)]
*  we look, it's a general that actually is now retired and working for a defense contractor. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=769.36s)]
*  So we'll look into it. But for now, so we'll just assume that he just loves war. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=773.84s)]
*  And we'll find out later if he had a personal interest. Okay, now you go to Van Jones. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=779.12s)]
*  We cannot have a nuclear armed Iran. Well, good news, Van, we don't. We didn't. And you make it [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=784.5600000000001s)]
*  seem like the only two choices were we were gonna get nuked by a nuclear armed Iran. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=791.04s)]
*  And they were not nuclear armed. And you know that. So I don't know why you're saying things [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=795.92s)]
*  that are patently false on television. Okay, no, the two options weren't they're gonna have a nuclear [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=800.88s)]
*  about to kill us or we have to invade them on behalf of Israel. No, the other option was get [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=806.3199999999999s)]
*  back into a peace treaty, the perfectly good one that Obama had. The one that Iran would go back [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=811.04s)]
*  into in any second where they would ship their uranium out to France and their plutonium out to [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=816.16s)]
*  Russia and they would get it back for energy purposes. We all know this, you know that, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=820.32s)]
*  but you're choosing to leave that option out so that American can cheerlead for war. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=824.96s)]
*  And then you have a temerity to ask progressives to cheerlead for a neocon war. And then the other [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=829.0400000000001s)]
*  absurdities. He says Iran is not a normal country. Tell me about how dangerous the Muslims are, Van. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=835.0400000000001s)]
*  They're super dangerous, aren't they? They don't respect women. That's why they've killed over [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=842.4000000000001s)]
*  20,000 women. No, that's Israel and Gaza. But they killed children, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=847.2s)]
*  that's 17,000 children dead in Gaza by Israel. But they fire rockets into civilian areas, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=853.2800000000001s)]
*  Israel in Gaza and in Iran and in Lebanon, let alone everywhere else. Everything he said [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=862.48s)]
*  could be applied to Israel. But if you applied it to Israel, how dare you? [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=869.2800000000001s)]
*  We can smear Muslims all day long. We can bomb them and kill them and world and progressives, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=875.84s)]
*  you should celebrate that. But if you ever say the truth about Israel, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=881.04s)]
*  very wrong. That is not pre-approved propaganda. CNN, MSNBC and Fox News, while pretending to [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=885.44s)]
*  disagree, will tell you no, no, you cannot say true things about Israel. Go ahead, Anna. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=893.04s)]
*  I mean, look, I actually I agree with Van Jones, Cenk. I mean, Iran is so terroristic that they [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=900.48s)]
*  like to call and give the United States warning ahead of time and let them know exactly what [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=906.24s)]
*  they're gonna do, military strikes, so the US can intercept those missiles and there won't be any [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=913.92s)]
*  civilian casualty. I'm just gonna say real quick, we just covered it earlier in the show. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=919.52s)]
*  Israel calls Iranian generals, Washington Post has covered it, audio recording of it. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=924.56s)]
*  And they threaten to murder their children if they don't betray their own home country. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=929.68s)]
*  I think Hamas actually did the phone call. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=933.76s)]
*  Oh, sure, of course. It was in self-defense. They threatened to murder their Iranian children [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=935.4399999999999s)]
*  in self-defense, of course, because Israel can never do anything wrong. Now, if Iran had called [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=940.16s)]
*  American generals and threatened to murder their children, what would we call them, Van? [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=944.4799999999999s)]
*  We'd call them terrorists, right? But when Israel does it, no, no, no. Israel has a program called [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=950.88s)]
*  Where's Daddy? where they use AI to pick targets so they have no idea if it's even true that the [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=955.68s)]
*  person is in any way connected to Hamas. That phone is connected to that phone, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=961.8399999999999s)]
*  connect to that website, next year somebody's dead. But that's not even the bad part. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=967.28s)]
*  Well, the awful part. That's the bad part. The awful part is they wait till they go home, [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=971.28s)]
*  so they murder the entire family with that guy. That's called Where's Daddy? [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=976.16s)]
*  Because as soon as daddy comes home, Israel murders their children. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=981.68s)]
*  But I know Iran is not a normal country. Iran, because they're Muslim, is so uniquely evil. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=985.92s)]
*  But don't ever look at all the things Israel has done. Because CNN, MSNBC, and Fox News just [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=994.88s)]
*  coincidentally happen to agree with Israel every single time. Get out of here, man. I vomit your [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=1001.12s)]
*  propaganda. I can't stand it. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ind479KwRG8&t=1008.4s)]
