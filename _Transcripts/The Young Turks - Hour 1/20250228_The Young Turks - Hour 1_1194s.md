TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.

TYT‚Äôs 24/7 programming is available on YouTube TV, Samsung TV, Plus, Roku, Xumo, TCLtv+, Fubo, and more.

TYT is also available as a podcast on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, TuneIn, Amazon Music, and more.

What does The Young Turks mean? Why is the show named The Young Turks?

The selection of the name The Young Turks reflects the definition provided in American Heritage Dictionary.

Young Turk (n.)

Young, progressive or insurgent member of an institution, movement or political party.

Young person who rebels against authority or societal expectations.

The selection of this name does not refer to any specific, historical incarnation of The Young Turks.

# MAGA FURIOUS Over Nothingburger Epstein File Release
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [February 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A)
*  You said last week that you have [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=0.0s)]
*  the Epstein files on your desk. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1.92s)]
*  When can we see them and [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=3.84s)]
*  what's taking so [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=5.16s)]
*  long to release them? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=6.08s)]
*  I do, Jesse, there are well over, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=7.8s)]
*  this will make you sick, 200 [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=10.88s)]
*  victims, we have to make sure that [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=13.58s)]
*  their identity is protected. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=16.52s)]
*  Other than that, I think tomorrow, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  Jesse, breaking news right now, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=21.28s)]
*  you're going to see some Epstein [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=23.28s)]
*  information being released by my [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=25.12s)]
*  office. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=27.0s)]
*  All right, well today is tomorrow [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=27.919999999999998s)]
*  and after hyping up the release of [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=30.0s)]
*  the long awaited Jeffrey Epstein [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=32.0s)]
*  files and then delivering a whole [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=34.1s)]
*  lot of nothing, conservatives, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=36.14s)]
*  MAGA people are upset at US Attorney [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=38.3s)]
*  General Pam Bondi and she's [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=40.6s)]
*  beginning to feel the full force of [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=42.56s)]
*  the MAGA wrath. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=44.76s)]
*  Cenk, I know you guys covered this [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=46.68s)]
*  a little bit on the show yesterday. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=48.239999999999995s)]
*  Are you surprised that things have [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=49.76s)]
*  only gotten worse for Pam Bondi? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=51.2s)]
*  I'm not at all surprised. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=53.32s)]
*  So MAGA is turning on Trump super [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=55.92s)]
*  hard on this one. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=58.08s)]
*  And so that's going to be a really [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=59.96s)]
*  interesting to watch. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=61.52s)]
*  We got some news on that. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=62.24s)]
*  I had a little bit of an exchange [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=63.84s)]
*  with Elon Musk about this on X. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=65.44s)]
*  We'll get to that as well. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=67.16s)]
*  But right now this does not look [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=68.92s)]
*  good for the Trump administration. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=70.44s)]
*  And I have a prediction on this [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=72.32s)]
*  coming up in a minute as well. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=73.96000000000001s)]
*  Let's get more of the details. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=75.88s)]
*  All right, well, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=78.44s)]
*  I'm sure you do. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=79.0s)]
*  So here are the details. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=79.56s)]
*  This is reporting from [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=80.6s)]
*  The Independent. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=81.6s)]
*  Says the information released on [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=82.68s)]
*  the day includes an evidence list, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=84.76s)]
*  white logs, Epstein's contact book, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=87.08s)]
*  and a redacted masseuse list, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=89.67999999999999s)]
*  featuring over 250 entries, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=91.76s)]
*  much of which was already public. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=93.96s)]
*  Some notable new information did [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=96.96s)]
*  pop up, however, including that [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=98.96s)]
*  Epstein had Mick Jagger, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=101.16s)]
*  Michael Jackson, actor Alec [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=102.88s)]
*  Baldwin, and supermodel Naomi Campbell [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=104.8s)]
*  in his list of phone contacts. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=107.32s)]
*  But there was more information that [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=109.36s)]
*  for some reason was not released. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=111.36s)]
*  I can't imagine what that reason [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=113.28s)]
*  was, at least according to the [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=114.96s)]
*  letter Bondi sent FBI Director [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=116.75999999999999s)]
*  Cash Patel yesterday. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=118.72s)]
*  It said Bondi suggested in a letter [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=120.28s)]
*  Thursday to FBI Director Cash [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=122.47999999999999s)]
*  Patel that more records were [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=124.44s)]
*  recently discovered. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=126.36s)]
*  She ordered the FBI to hand over [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=127.96s)]
*  the full and complete Epstein files [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=130.07999999999998s)]
*  to her by Friday morning and [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=132.64s)]
*  directed Patel conduct an [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=134.72s)]
*  immediate investigation into why [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=136.76s)]
*  her order to the FBI to turn over [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=139.32s)]
*  the documents was not followed. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=141.8s)]
*  And the shocker, the deadline for [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=144.36s)]
*  this was 8 AM on Friday, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=146.56s)]
*  February 28th, that is today. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=148.24s)]
*  Today is Friday, February 28th, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=150.32000000000002s)]
*  and it's way after 8 AM. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=152.52s)]
*  And we still have nothing, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=154.24s)]
*  the documents were never handed [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=155.84s)]
*  over and MAGA is angry. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=157.84s)]
*  They're furious, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=159.28s)]
*  specifically at Pam Bondi. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=160.52s)]
*  Not only because, again, most of [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=162.52s)]
*  the information that was released [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=164.32000000000002s)]
*  was already available under [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=166.20000000000002s)]
*  the Biden administration. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=167.76000000000002s)]
*  But because the Trump [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=169.52s)]
*  administration pulled this little [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=170.76s)]
*  PR stunt regarding the whole thing. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=172.48s)]
*  Here's a tweet from Laura Loomer, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=174.4s)]
*  Trump's BFF. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=176.44s)]
*  And she says, there is one person [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=177.6s)]
*  who takes the blame for [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=179.56s)]
*  what happened today. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=180.76s)]
*  It's Pam Bondi. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=181.8s)]
*  I think she should resign. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=183.16s)]
*  She went on Fox News and said the [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=184.52s)]
*  files were on her desk. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=186.36s)]
*  Then she went on Fox News last [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=188.12s)]
*  night and said we would have files [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=189.76s)]
*  today. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=191.76s)]
*  She's a total liar, just face it. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=192.32s)]
*  That's not all she said, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=195.2s)]
*  she had more. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=196.28s)]
*  She said, I'm told the organizers [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=197.24s)]
*  of the event at the White House [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=199.12s)]
*  yesterday have told all of [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=200.88000000000002s)]
*  the influencers involved to post [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=202.48000000000002s)]
*  selfie videos denying Pam Bondi's [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=204.4s)]
*  involvement and to claim they all [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=206.44000000000003s)]
*  had no idea they were getting [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=208.36s)]
*  binders. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=210.0s)]
*  Everything is so scripted. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=211.0s)]
*  Pam is the one who handed them [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=213.0s)]
*  the binders and strutted into [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=214.52s)]
*  the meeting to make a big deal [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=216.16000000000003s)]
*  about the binders. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=217.88000000000002s)]
*  How can they say she wasn't [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=219.20000000000002s)]
*  involved now? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=220.64000000000001s)]
*  Are we resorting to lying now? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=221.32000000000002s)]

*  set her up. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=330.68s)]

*  Trump is in office and [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=332.92s)]

*  the deep state. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=337.4s)]
*  I'm confused. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=338.56s)]
*  I was told we fired the deep state. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=339.64s)]
*  Those are excellent points coming [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=343.88s)]
*  from Laura Loomer. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=345.68s)]
*  And it's interesting because it [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=347.08s)]
*  speaks directly to a lot of [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=348.48s)]
*  the cognitive dissonance that we see [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=349.64s)]

*  where they say one thing and [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=352.52s)]
*  then they just don't identify it [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=353.76s)]
*  whenever it comes from Trump, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=355.32s)]
*  right? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=356.72s)]
*  They're mad about this thing, but [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=357.28000000000003s)]
*  whenever the Trump administration [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=358.64s)]
*  or Republicans do the thing that [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=360.12s)]

*  they make excuses for it. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=364.28000000000003s)]
*  And there are various examples of [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=365.64s)]
*  that, various examples of that [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=367.24s)]
*  that we're going to cover later on [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=368.76s)]
*  in this very show. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=370.36s)]

*  Trump implicated in any of this? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=379.08000000000004s)]
*  Well, you're right. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=381.16s)]

*  points. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=392.28000000000003s)]

*  young for this, I know Cenk [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=397.48s)]

*  he was going to go into Al Capone's [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=402.0s)]
*  secret vault and find a bunch of [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=404.96s)]

*  rocks and empty bottles. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=409.03999999999996s)]

*  sexual things and all that other [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=428.8s)]
*  stuff. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=431.2s)]
*  And I'm not saying that that stuff [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=431.76s)]
*  was going on with the sexual stuff [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=433.52s)]
*  that was going on with Epstein, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=435.4s)]
*  but the right, I think, feels like [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=437.24s)]
*  it's going to take down the [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=439.15999999999997s)]

*  And the irony is, you look at [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=446.91999999999996s)]
*  the travel logs and the flight [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=448.79999999999995s)]

*  up in them. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=453.2s)]
*  So then they somehow explain it [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=454.2s)]
*  away. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=456.64s)]
*  And in my opinion, it's just [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=457.2s)]
*  amazing how passionate they are on [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=459.59999999999997s)]
*  finding Epstein's, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=463.59999999999997s)]

*  with P Diddy and Epstein and [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=469.47999999999996s)]

*  there's nothing that's going to [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=472.52s)]
*  shock us. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=474.32s)]
*  So there's nothing shocking. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=475.08s)]
*  And you know what's shocking is [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=476.68s)]
*  that you guys are so stupid that [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=478.32s)]
*  you think that this is what we [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=480.12s)]
*  should be concentrating on when [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=481.76s)]
*  the guy that you voted for said [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=483.64s)]
*  he's going to bring the price of [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=485.44s)]
*  eggs down and he sold the presidency [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=487.24s)]
*  to the richest dude in the world [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=489.28s)]
*  who's telling you just like you [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=491.12s)]
*  said, Yasmin, that it's hard. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=492.88s)]
*  It's hard getting started here. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=494.91999999999996s)]
*  You don't have control right away. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=496.91999999999996s)]
*  And he's sitting there cutting all [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=499.0s)]
*  these jobs, cutting all these [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=501.12s)]
*  agencies that actually are needed [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=502.96s)]
*  in America and around the world. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=504.96s)]
*  And they're now just obsessed with [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=506.88s)]
*  the Epstein files. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=508.91999999999996s)]
*  I wish they would put a little [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=510.2s)]
*  more energy into maybe just [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=511.91999999999996s)]
*  reflecting upon themselves and [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=513.52s)]
*  going, wait a minute, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=515.36s)]
*  I voted for this guy and [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=516.64s)]
*  this is what he's doing. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=517.92s)]
*  It's like all the Palestinians [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=519.6s)]
*  that had the or the all the Arabs [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=521.1999999999999s)]
*  that had the awakening when the [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=522.92s)]
*  Gaza video came out and [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=524.4399999999999s)]
*  he wanted to make Gaza a resort. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=525.64s)]
*  They go, I voted for that guy or [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=527.64s)]
*  the Venezuelan lady who was with [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=529.56s)]
*  the video where she was like, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=531.56s)]
*  Trump is the best. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=533.4399999999999s)]
*  And then he got rid of the [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=534.6s)]
*  temporary protection status. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=536.1999999999999s)]
*  He's like, Trump lied to us. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=537.8s)]
*  So I think Trump lied to us is [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=539.56s)]
*  a t-shirt that should be printed [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=541.6s)]
*  and worn by all these people. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=543.84s)]
*  And pretty soon, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=546.12s)]
*  everyone that voted for him will [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=547.4s)]
*  be wearing that shirt. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=549.48s)]
*  So I want to get into the two [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=551.2s)]
*  different issues here. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=552.96s)]
*  One is Epstein and [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=554.52s)]
*  the other is the MAGA reaction [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=555.44s)]
*  because I think they're both [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=556.84s)]
*  important. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=558.2s)]
*  And one of the questions I want to [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=558.72s)]
*  address is deep state, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=560.4s)]
*  who's deep state? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=561.6s)]
*  So hold that thought because that [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=562.5600000000001s)]
*  was important. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=564.4s)]
*  So first on the substance of [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=565.32s)]
*  Epstein, so they released names [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=567.04s)]
*  that we already knew. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=569.16s)]
*  And remember those names don't [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=570.64s)]
*  necessarily mean they did it. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=572.4s)]
*  That's just Epstein's name. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=574.08s)]
*  That's just Epstein's contact list [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=576.36s)]
*  on his phone. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=578.4s)]
*  So he has a lot of women on that [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=579.52s)]
*  list, they didn't necessarily get [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=581.6s)]
*  massages at all, right? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=584.16s)]
*  So my point there is that was [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=586.0s)]
*  a big giant nothing burger. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=588.0s)]
*  Now that leads to part of what I [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=590.4399999999999s)]
*  want to talk about with the MAGA [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=592.28s)]
*  reaction, which is that in my [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=594.32s)]
*  experience in the first term, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=596.4s)]
*  if Trump did this, they would have [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=598.4s)]
*  been like, yeah, of course, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=600.68s)]
*  the names, that's all we needed. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=602.72s)]
*  And the fact that we don't even [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=604.96s)]
*  know anything about the names, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=606.24s)]
*  it's beautiful, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=607.48s)]
*  Trump is the greatest. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=608.1600000000001s)]
*  Trump is a demi-god, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=608.96s)]
*  no one should criticize him. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=610.1600000000001s)]
*  He's got Epstein, right? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=612.2800000000001s)]
*  That's my experience with what [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=614.36s)]
*  happened in the Trump first term, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=616.0s)]
*  right? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=617.84s)]
*  What's interesting is this time [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=618.5600000000001s)]
*  around, they're like, wait, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=620.24s)]
*  that's a nothing burger. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=621.8000000000001s)]
*  Remember, Trump doesn't give a damn [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=623.84s)]
*  what the left thinks, right? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=625.24s)]
*  Trump doesn't care what the mainstream [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=626.2800000000001s)]
*  media thinks. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=627.76s)]
*  But it's his own base going, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=628.2800000000001s)]
*  what the hell is this? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=629.64s)]
*  You lied to us. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=630.5600000000001s)]
*  This isn't the Epstein file. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=631.6s)]
*  You think we're stupid? [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=633.2s)]
*  And so that leaves a prediction [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=635.08s)]
*  number one. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=636.6800000000001s)]
*  Guys, they're going to get caught. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=637.76s)]
*  And I don't mean caught by us. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=639.4000000000001s)]
*  It's easy for us to rant about it, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=641.48s)]
*  etc. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=643.48s)]
*  And it's easy for us to be right, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=644.0s)]
*  but that doesn't mean you're going [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=645.5600000000001s)]
*  to convince the voters that you [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=647.2s)]
*  need to win the next election. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=648.64s)]
*  Remember, he won the popular vote, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=650.2800000000001s)]
*  right? [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=651.88s)]
*  So you've got to convince Trump [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=652.6s)]
*  voters that he's on the wrong path. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=654.1600000000001s)]
*  And my point has been throughout, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=656.0400000000001s)]
*  you'd be surprised. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=658.1600000000001s)]
*  A lot of those Trump voters have [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=659.9200000000001s)]
*  a way more open mind, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=661.64s)]
*  not all of them, not all of them. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=662.76s)]
*  Maybe not even a majority of them. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=664.72s)]
*  But a lot of them have more of [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=666.5600000000001s)]
*  an open mind than they did in [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=668.0s)]
*  this first term, partly because [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=669.44s)]
*  they're listening and [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=670.96s)]
*  watching different media. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=672.0s)]
*  So here they are, they get tested [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=673.48s)]
*  on Epstein, a thing that, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=675.4s)]
*  I mean, right or wrong, you're [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=677.1600000000001s)]
*  right, that they care a lot about. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=678.96s)]
*  They care a ton about this. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=680.84s)]
*  And so when Pam Bondi said, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=683.08s)]
*  it's on my desk and [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=684.44s)]
*  I'm going to give it to you. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=685.4s)]
*  And then she gave him this nonsense [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=686.84s)]
*  and thought she could trick them. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=688.48s)]
*  They were super pissed. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=690.0s)]
*  Having Trump's voters super pissed [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=692.08s)]
*  is great for the country, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=694.24s)]
*  not because ha ha, we got Trump. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=695.76s)]
*  But because it means that some of [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=697.76s)]
*  them, a lot of them, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=699.76s)]
*  are thinking for themselves. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=701.0s)]
*  So that's an enormous development. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=703.48s)]
*  So prediction number one is, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=705.8s)]
*  this is just the beginning. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=707.4s)]
*  They're going to get caught over [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=709.3199999999999s)]
*  and over and over again, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=710.88s)]
*  not just by us, but [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=712.1999999999999s)]
*  by their own voters. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=713.3199999999999s)]
*  I'm going to get to prediction [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=714.8s)]
*  number two in a second. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=715.9599999999999s)]
*  Now, to the Epstein substance. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=716.8399999999999s)]
*  So the names are nothing, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=720.12s)]
*  we learned nothing from this at all. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=721.04s)]
*  The files she said exist and [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=722.24s)]
*  were on our desk. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=723.64s)]
*  Now she's trying to blame the [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=725.16s)]
*  Southern District of New York. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=726.16s)]
*  And she said it's okay, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=727.2s)]
*  I'm going to go get them from [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=728.4s)]
*  the FBI, Cash Patel is in charge [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=729.6s)]
*  of the FBI. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=731.24s)]
*  So I'm sure the biggest Trump [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=733.36s)]
*  loyalist there is, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=734.96s)]
*  when he has the damning Epstein [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=736.08s)]
*  files, he's going to turn it over. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=737.6s)]
*  But he hasn't, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=739.04s)]
*  he hasn't turned it over today. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=739.64s)]
*  So what do we think is happening? [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=741.08s)]
*  Well, in order to determine that, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=742.5600000000001s)]
*  you have to think about, well, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=744.8s)]
*  what happened to Epstein? [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=746.8s)]
*  So number one, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=748.4s)]
*  did he commit suicide? [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=749.4s)]
*  Well, on the Young Turks, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=751.28s)]
*  the day that the news broke, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=752.84s)]
*  I sat on the air, guys, if the [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=754.6s)]
*  camera in the hallway of that, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=756.6s)]
*  where he was being held in that [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=758.8s)]
*  prison is working, then he [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=760.88s)]
*  committed suicide, as they say. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=762.76s)]
*  because you'll be able to see [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=765.28s)]
*  people going in and out. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=766.8s)]
*  And if there's nobody going in or [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=768.6s)]
*  out and he was in his cell by [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=770.36s)]
*  himself, okay, suicide. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=771.96s)]
*  I said if the camera is magically [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=773.56s)]
*  not working, then it wasn't suicide. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=775.4s)]
*  They definitely killed him, right? [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=778.16s)]
*  And the reason I tell you about [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=779.76s)]
*  that prediction is not ha ha, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=781.44s)]
*  yeah, I was right. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=783.24s)]
*  No, it's to show you that I'm not [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=784.52s)]
*  Monday morning quarterbacking this. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=786.5600000000001s)]
*  I'm on tape saying if the camera [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=789.24s)]
*  isn't working, then clearly he [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=791.0s)]
*  didn't commit suicide. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=792.6s)]
*  And then it turned out not only was [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=794.12s)]
*  the camera not working, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=795.4s)]
*  the two guards happened to be off [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=796.4s)]
*  at the same time. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=797.76s)]
*  They happened to take his cellmate [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=798.72s)]
*  out of the cell right before. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=800.5600000000001s)]
*  Come on, I mean, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=802.24s)]
*  if you were going to murder him, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=803.08s)]
*  those are the first three steps you [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=804.64s)]
*  would do and step number four is [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=806.2s)]
*  going in murder. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=807.64s)]
*  So then that leads to the inexorable [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=808.6s)]
*  question, which is going to make [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=810.6s)]
*  a lot of people uncomfortable. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=812.44s)]
*  What is a force that is powerful [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=814.72s)]
*  enough to kill someone inside [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=817.6s)]
*  a maximum security United States [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=820.4s)]
*  prison and get away with it? [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=823.44s)]
*  And have no one talk, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=826.36s)]
*  whether it's a Biden administration [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=827.64s)]
*  or a Trump administration, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=829.8000000000001s)]
*  about how the cameras out and [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=831.32s)]
*  the guards are off and all these [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=832.6800000000001s)]
*  obvious, obvious things we could [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=834.28s)]
*  all see with our own eyes. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=835.96s)]
*  And then all of a sudden the files [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=837.3199999999999s)]
*  are golly gee, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=839.24s)]
*  where are the files? [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=840.04s)]
*  I can't find them. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=840.88s)]
*  What is the one force on earth that [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=842.28s)]
*  has both of our parties completely [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=844.3199999999999s)]
*  under their control? [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=846.4s)]
*  Are you sure it's our deep state [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=849.4s)]
*  that's the problem? [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=851.0s)]
*  because our deep state is filled [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=851.9599999999999s)]
*  with a bunch of clownish bureaucrats. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=853.64s)]
*  Okay, you guys think that there's [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=855.92s)]
*  some sort of like genius boogie man [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=857.56s)]
*  in there I haven't seen yet, right? [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=859.24s)]
*  But there is another deep state [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=862.04s)]
*  from another country that is super [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=863.88s)]
*  powerful and super effective. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=866.0799999999999s)]
*  And isn't just occupying different [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=868.36s)]
*  countries, but [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=870.4799999999999s)]
*  perhaps here as well. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=871.4799999999999s)]
*  So somebody's got a better [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=873.52s)]
*  explanation, I'd like to hear it. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=874.9599999999999s)]
*  But Mike, that leads to prediction [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=877.28s)]
*  number two. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=879.9599999999999s)]
*  They ain't going to find those [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=881.92s)]
*  files. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=883.0s)]
*  Those files were not on [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=883.36s)]
*  Pam Bondi's desk. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=884.9599999999999s)]
*  They thought they could trick their [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=886.24s)]
*  own voters. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=887.5999999999999s)]
*  Those files all of a sudden, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=888.3199999999999s)]
*  it will be announced that they are [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=889.92s)]
*  suddenly missing. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=891.8s)]
*  Golly gee, we were going to hand [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=893.64s)]
*  over the Epstein files. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=895.32s)]
*  But my boss's boss is called and [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=897.2s)]
*  it turns out there's a force we [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=899.1600000000001s)]
*  can't mess with. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=901.12s)]
*  So you will never ever see those [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=902.44s)]
*  files or they'll say, they were [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=904.5600000000001s)]
*  somebody that was in the deep state [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=906.96s)]
*  got rid of them earlier, wink. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=909.6s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=913.24s)]
*  Okay, we'll see if I'm right. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=914.88s)]
*  But I think that if they keep going [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=916.96s)]
*  like this, they're messing with [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=920.08s)]
*  an issue. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=923.2800000000001s)]
*  Again, to Maz's point, an issue [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=925.0s)]
*  their base cares a lot about and [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=927.1600000000001s)]
*  they think they could just trick [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=929.24s)]
*  them, I don't think they can. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=931.08s)]
*  Real quick guys, I know because [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=932.72s)]
*  we're running out of time. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=934.12s)]
*  Look, I wrote about the same thing [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=935.4000000000001s)]
*  on Twitter. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=937.32s)]
*  I talked about who's strong enough [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=938.12s)]
*  to do this. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=940.0400000000001s)]
*  I don't know anyone else who is. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=940.6800000000001s)]
*  Then Elon Musk wrote back in that [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=942.72s)]
*  comment and said, my guess is that [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=944.6400000000001s)]
*  he did, meaning he committed [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=946.72s)]
*  suicide, that Epstein committed [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=948.5200000000001s)]
*  suicide, but the suicide would [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=950.4000000000001s)]
*  have stopped if the guards were [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=952.1999999999999s)]
*  there or the camera was functional, [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=953.88s)]
*  so it was likely assisted. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=956.0s)]
*  He may have been promised something [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=957.64s)]
*  in exchange for killing himself. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=959.6s)]
*  That's what I'm curious about. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=961.8399999999999s)]
*  And I wrote back, when someone [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=963.88s)]

*  I said on the on church when [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=969.88s)]
*  the news broke, if the camera was [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=970.92s)]

*  okay, because they care about this [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=996.04s)]
*  and they have eyes and ears. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=998.76s)]
*  They saw Epstein didn't commit [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1000.8s)]

*  on here. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1015.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's somehow the [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1017.28s)]
*  more comforting aspect of this [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1018.88s)]
*  story for me at least is that there [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1020.52s)]
*  is a lot of unity as far as the way [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1022.48s)]
*  that people are starting to look at [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1024.3999999999999s)]
*  the world, we're starting to [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1026.44s)]
*  realize that in this story and [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1028.24s)]
*  even in the last story that there [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1030.16s)]
*  are things that are binding and [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1032.24s)]
*  that are common between more people [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1034.16s)]
*  than we realize because you know [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1036.36s)]
*  what, it's been really exhausting [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1038.32s)]
*  years at least let's say, just [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1040.24s)]
*  being so divided as a country and [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1042.04s)]
*  especially here on the left. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1043.84s)]
*  And I always say that one of the [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1045.72s)]
*  curses of being a progressive is [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1047.28s)]
*  that you tend to be ahead of [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1048.84s)]
*  the curve on certain things and [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1050.24s)]
*  you're just waiting for [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1051.8s)]
*  people to catch up and I don't mean [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1052.96s)]
*  that in like an arrogant way. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1054.76s)]
*  I'm just saying that we tend to be [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1056.56s)]
*  pushing more for things as the name [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1058.16s)]
*  would suggest, right? [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1059.96s)]
*  So at this point, we are starting [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1061.6s)]
*  to see that a lot of people are [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1063.16s)]
*  starting to realize that a lot of [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1064.56s)]
*  the things that the Trump [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1066.1200000000001s)]
*  administration is fighting for and [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1067.28s)]
*  things that they're actually doing [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1069.04s)]
*  isn't helping people and [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1070.88s)]
*  it isn't delivering the things that [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1072.16s)]
*  people want to them. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1074.12s)]
*  And for whatever reason, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1075.72s)]
*  a lot of Trump supporters really [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1077.24s)]
*  care a lot about these Epstein [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1078.96s)]
*  files, they want to see them. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1080.68s)]
*  They want to see all the Democrats [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1082.36s)]
*  that they can implicate with [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1084.04s)]
*  the files so they can feel [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1085.52s)]
*  justified and say, look, see, [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1086.96s)]
*  I told you, I told you this is [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1088.72s)]
*  what's going to happen. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1090.32s)]
*  I told you all the Democrats were [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1091.48s)]
*  evil, I told you they were all [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1092.88s)]
*  doing things that they weren't [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1094.2s)]
*  supposed to be doing. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1095.52s)]
*  They want that moment for [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1096.64s)]
*  themselves. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1097.92s)]
*  They've waited years for [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1098.72s)]
*  that kind of a release and [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1100.2s)]
*  they're getting antsy and [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1101.64s)]
*  they want it, they were promised [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1103.16s)]
*  it and they're not going to get it. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1104.96s)]
*  And I feel bad for them, but [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1106.8s)]
*  I feel like that's a wake up call [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1108.24s)]
*  that they need to experience. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1109.92s)]
*  And of course, whatever Republicans [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1111.76s)]
*  happen to be on that list as well, [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1113.76s)]
*  they're just going to say, no, [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1115.52s)]
*  they were just there investigating. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1117.32s)]
*  They were just trying to stop all [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1119.4s)]
*  the bad stuff from happening. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1120.8s)]
*  Whatever it is that they need to [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1122.2s)]
*  tell themselves to make themselves [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1123.64s)]
*  feel better and to make themselves [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1125.24s)]
*  feel as if they're on the right [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1126.88s)]
*  list. Personally, I kind of don't [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1128.7199999999998s)]
*  care about the list, right? [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1130.3999999999999s)]
*  I don't think that a whole lot is [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1132.04s)]
*  going to come from it. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1133.3999999999999s)]
*  I don't think that once all these [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1134.4399999999998s)]
*  names get released, we're going to [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1135.7199999999998s)]
*  be like, my God, I can't believe [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1137.1599999999999s)]
*  this person was on the list. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1138.4799999999998s)]
*  I don't think that anything [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1139.6799999999998s)]
*  meaningful is going to come from [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1140.8s)]
*  it. I would love to know more [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1142.12s)]
*  about Jeffrey Epstein and his [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1143.7199999999998s)]
*  death and who was behind it and [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1145.4799999999998s)]
*  all these things, what he was [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1147.1599999999999s)]
*  hiding, that story is interesting [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1148.8799999999999s)]
*  and valid to me. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1150.9199999999998s)]
*  But again, with the Trump [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1152.24s)]
*  administration currently in power, [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1153.56s)]
*  I'm a little nervous about the [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1155.9199999999998s)]
*  maybe if all this stuff does get [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1157.6s)]
*  released, what is going to come [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1159.36s)]
*  from it? [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1161.0s)]
*  I'm not sure, maybe something for [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1161.6s)]
*  being optimistic, but at this [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1163.8s)]
*  point, I really just can't see it. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfHO350zR1A&t=1165.48s)]
