# How Much Was Trump Involved In The Attacks On Iran?
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4)
*  President speaking with our John [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=0.0s)]
*  Carl said of the attacks that he [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=1.52s)]
*  thinks it's been excellent. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=3.06s)]
*  He said we gave them a chance and [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  they didn't take it. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=6.26s)]
*  They got hit very, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=7.44s)]
*  they got hit hard, very hard. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=8.66s)]
*  They got hit about as hard as [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=10.68s)]
*  you're going to get hit. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=11.96s)]
*  And there's more to come, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  a lot more. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=14.44s)]
*  And when asked if the US [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=15.44s)]
*  participated in the attack in any [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=16.62s)]
*  way, the president interestingly [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=18.38s)]
*  said I don't want to comment on [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=20.16s)]
*  that. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=21.72s)]
*  We are getting, and we were likely [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=22.22s)]
*  to get in the near future, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  very mixed messages about exactly [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  what was going on in terms of [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=27.36s)]
*  coordination between the government [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=28.84s)]
*  of the United States and Israel in [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=30.84s)]
*  advance of those strikes. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=32.76s)]
*  And so now regardless, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=34.32s)]
*  Donald Trump, what have you believe [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=35.68s)]
*  that he was totally on board? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=37.84s)]
*  That maybe this was even his idea [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  and it's awesome and [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=41.4s)]
*  it will help us achieve all of our [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=42.6s)]
*  goals, which he had been failing on [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=44.52s)]
*  in terms of getting that deal, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=46.68s)]
*  I guess since we needed to move to [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=48.519999999999996s)]
*  these attacks. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=50.36s)]
*  But don't consider it a failure, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=51.36s)]
*  he's on board with the war and [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=53.24s)]
*  there's going to be a whole lot of [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=54.88s)]
*  it to come. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=56.760000000000005s)]
*  That's what he's saying now. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=58.239999999999995s)]
*  Interestingly, coming right out of [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=59.519999999999996s)]
*  the attacks, that's not what [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=61.31999999999999s)]
*  the administration was saying. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=62.68s)]
*  So Marco Rubio, Secretary of State, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=64.36s)]
*  he put out this statement saying, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=66.25999999999999s)]
*  tonight Israel took unilateral [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=68.0s)]
*  action against Iran. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=69.66s)]
*  We are not involved in strikes [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=71.12s)]
*  against Iran and our top priorities [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=72.6s)]
*  protecting American forces in [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=74.24s)]
*  the region. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=75.8s)]
*  Israel advised us that they believe [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=76.44s)]
*  this action was necessary for [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=78.28s)]
*  its self-defense. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=79.67999999999999s)]
*  Let me be clear, Iran should not [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=80.72s)]
*  target US interests or personnel. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=82.67999999999999s)]
*  So that is what Marco Rubio is [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=85.12s)]
*  saying that we should not get [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=86.68s)]
*  involved in this, which it being [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=88.28s)]
*  Marco Rubio and considering his [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=90.12s)]
*  backers, I'm sure Cenk is going to [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=91.92s)]
*  have a lot to say about that. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=93.80000000000001s)]
*  But if you hear it from Donald [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=95.60000000000001s)]
*  Trump, we were way more involved in [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=97.52000000000001s)]
*  it. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=100.04s)]
*  He said, it is untrue social, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=100.54s)]
*  I gave Iran chance after chance to [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=102.36000000000001s)]
*  make a deal. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=104.34s)]
*  I told them in the strongest of [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=105.16000000000001s)]
*  words to just do it. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=106.68s)]
*  But no matter how hard they tried, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=108.2s)]
*  no matter how close they got, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=109.76s)]
*  they just couldn't get it done. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=111.12s)]
*  I told them it would be much worse [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=112.64000000000001s)]
*  than anything they know, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=114.08000000000001s)]
*  anticipated or were told, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=115.2s)]
*  that the United States makes the [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=116.64s)]
*  best and most lethal military [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=118.44s)]
*  equipment anywhere in the world by [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=120.19999999999999s)]
*  fire, and that Israel has a lot of [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=122.24s)]
*  it with much more to come and [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=124.36s)]
*  they know how to use it, much more. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=126.39999999999999s)]
*  $50 billion worth of more, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=129.0s)]
*  $100 billion worth of more, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=131.14s)]
*  $1 to $2 trillion worth of more. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=133.56s)]
*  I don't know, I've lived through [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=136.32s)]
*  these wars before, those numbers [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=138.32s)]
*  can go sky high very fast. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=140.35999999999999s)]
*  He continues, there has already [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=141.76s)]
*  been great death and destruction, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=143.64s)]
*  but there is still time to make [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=146.76000000000002s)]
*  this slaughter with the next [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=148.24s)]
*  already planned attacks being even [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=149.52s)]
*  more brutal come to an end. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=151.28s)]
*  Iran must make a deal before there [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=152.64000000000001s)]
*  is nothing left and save what was [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=154.38000000000002s)]
*  once known as the Iranian Empire. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=156.12s)]
*  God, he's so weird. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=158.0s)]
*  No more death, no more destruction, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=159.32000000000002s)]
*  just do it before it's too late. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=161.44s)]
*  And that's he rolled it out [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=163.60000000000002s)]
*  in true social, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=164.68s)]
*  he's been working on it. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=165.32000000000002s)]
*  Here he is with a similar sort of [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=166.60000000000002s)]
*  message to Dana Bash. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=168.16000000000003s)]
*  He responded by saying, well, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=170.0s)]
*  we of course support Israel, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=171.88000000000002s)]
*  obviously, and supported it like [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=173.72000000000003s)]
*  nobody has ever supported it. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=175.72s)]
*  And then he went on to say this, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=177.56s)]
*  Iran should have listened to me [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=179.68s)]
*  when I said, I don't know if you [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=181.96s)]
*  know this, but I gave them a 60 day [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=184.22s)]
*  warning, and today is day 61. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=186.92s)]
*  And then he said, they, meaning [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=189.44s)]
*  Iran, should now come to the table [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=191.96s)]
*  to make a deal before it's too [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=194.48s)]
*  late. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=196.8s)]
*  And then he said something really [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=197.76s)]
*  noteworthy. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=200.16s)]
*  He said, the people I was dealing [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=201.52s)]
*  with were dead, the hardliners, to [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=203.79999999999998s)]
*  which I just wanted to underscore. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=206.28s)]
*  So what you're saying is, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=208.48s)]
*  Israel has now killed the people [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=210.35999999999999s)]
*  who you were dealing with. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=212.67999999999998s)]
*  And he said very sarcastically, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=214.6s)]
*  they didn't die of the flu, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=216.64s)]
*  they didn't die of COVID. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=218.28s)]
*  The weirdest possible response to [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=221.07999999999998s)]
*  that question. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=222.88s)]
*  By the way, I could have missed it. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=223.79999999999998s)]
*  I've never heard of that 60 day [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=226.2s)]
*  thing before. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=227.95999999999998s)]
*  I'm assuming he's lying about that [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=229.44s)]
*  in the same way that he supposedly [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=231.04s)]
*  called Gavin Newsom and berated him. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=232.72s)]
*  And there's no evidence that that [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=234.38s)]
*  was true too. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=236.16s)]
*  Donald Trump is being made to look [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=236.88s)]
*  a fool in situations around [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=239.12s)]
*  the globe. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=241.07999999999998s)]
*  He couldn't solve Ukraine in one [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=242.12s)]
*  day, he couldn't resolve [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=243.72s)]
*  the situation in Gaza. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=245.02s)]
*  He couldn't stop Israel from [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=246.4s)]
*  attacking Iran. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=248.0s)]
*  He couldn't make China bow down to [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=248.88s)]
*  us economically or [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=251.04s)]
*  Europe for that matter. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=252.24s)]
*  He is looking weak and foolish and [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=254.12s)]
*  old and tired. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=256.6s)]
*  And so more and more lies need to [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=258.56s)]
*  be rolled out on a daily basis to [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=260.52s)]
*  puff him up and pretend that he's [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=262.44s)]
*  strong and clever and sharp and [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=264.36s)]
*  tough and everybody's very [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=266.16s)]
*  intimidated by him. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=267.71999999999997s)]
*  And so some of that comes in the [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=268.84s)]
*  form of these lies, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=269.92s)]
*  which I know we'll talk about. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=270.56s)]
*  But I just want everyone to be [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=271.84s)]
*  prepared. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=273.12s)]
*  Since he apparently has no [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=273.64s)]
*  capacity to make himself feel like [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=275.52s)]
*  a big tough guy abroad, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=277.64s)]
*  it's possible he'll want to do that [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=279.2s)]
*  here in America. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=281.32s)]
*  It's possible that it's not [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=282.8s)]
*  a coincidence that he's using [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=284.15999999999997s)]
*  the military so early in his second [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=285.76s)]
*  term against protesters and [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=287.64s)]
*  promising, if you come to my [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=289.28s)]
*  military parade, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=290.92s)]
*  I'm going to do the same thing. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=291.72s)]
*  This is a guy who needs to believe [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=293.16s)]
*  that he's tough and he's not. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=294.76s)]
*  And when that's shown, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=296.6s)]
*  when he's flailing and [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=297.8s)]
*  when he's being criticized by [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=299.08000000000004s)]
*  the right, by the way, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=300.44s)]
*  he needs to make himself feel [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=301.56s)]
*  better somehow. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=302.84000000000003s)]
*  So I would watch yourself if you're [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=303.72s)]
*  out on the streets this weekend. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=305.04s)]
*  Yeah, so first of all, they're more [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=306.6s)]
*  likely to come to the table. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=308.72s)]
*  What table? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=310.64s)]
*  Israel just blew up the table. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=311.28000000000003s)]
*  Iran literally has to find a new [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=313.36s)]
*  peace negotiator because their [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=315.68s)]
*  peace negotiator was murdered by [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=318.36s)]
*  Israel. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=321.48s)]
*  Gee, I wonder if you want peace or [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=324.12s)]
*  war when you murder the other side's [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=326.36s)]
*  peace negotiator, okay? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=328.88s)]
*  So let's don't ever let anyone lie [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=331.04s)]
*  to you, Israel 100% started this [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=333.76s)]
*  war, okay? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=336.64s)]
*  And no, Iran was not close to [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=338.52s)]
*  having a nuclear bomb. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=340.24s)]
*  That would have taken well over [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=341.84s)]
*  a year, even if they got to [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=343.52s)]
*  weaponized uranium, they still had [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=345.08s)]
*  no way of delivering it, okay? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=347.28s)]
*  That's like building a bomb is a [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=349.15999999999997s)]
*  completely different enterprise [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=351.11999999999995s)]
*  than enriching uranium. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=353.35999999999996s)]
*  And it's amazing how everything [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=355.2s)]
*  gets memory hold. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=357.4s)]
*  So that's immediately forgotten by [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=359.15999999999997s)]
*  all the press, the fact that they [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=361.11999999999995s)]
*  bombed in the middle of their [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=362.79999999999995s)]
*  capital and killed civilians, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=364.23999999999995s)]
*  barely reported. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=366.0s)]
*  But my God, the injuries, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=367.52s)]
*  the injuries in Israel, and [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=369.2s)]
*  now they're instantly the victims, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=370.84s)]
*  right? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=372.84s)]
*  So look, we're doing a poll, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=373.59999999999997s)]
*  speaking of that, on our website, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=375.15999999999997s)]
*  www.youtube.com. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=377.2s)]
*  Now that Israel started a war with [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=378.47999999999996s)]
*  Iran, how much should we support [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=380.28s)]
*  Israel from now on? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=382.08s)]
*  Well, number one, A, more financial [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=383.08s)]
*  aid to help them defend themselves. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=385.32s)]
*  B, less financial aid because this [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=387.64s)]
*  war is against our interests, or C, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=390.08s)]
*  our aid to Israel should be zero, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=392.64s)]
*  zero, okay? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=395.08s)]
*  So now let's talk about how they're [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=396.52s)]
*  going to drag us in. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=398.15999999999997s)]
*  Real quick on Rubio, by the way, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=399.12s)]
*  John, you mentioned that. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=400.64s)]
*  Now, yes, Rubio's taking over [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=402.12s)]
*  a million dollars from AIPAC [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=403.52s)]
*  throughout his career. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=404.71999999999997s)]
*  But so have a lot of senators and [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=405.88000000000005s)]
*  congressmen, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=407.32000000000005s)]
*  they're all owned by AIPAC. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=407.84000000000003s)]
*  I debated someone earlier today on [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=409.36s)]
*  a different show where they said, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=410.96000000000004s)]
*  no, no, no, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=412.68s)]
*  AIPAC's just giving them money [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=413.40000000000003s)]
*  because they happen to agree. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=415.0s)]
*  They're not buying them, and [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=418.0s)]
*  they're not, and [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=419.36s)]
*  AIPAC's not working on behalf of [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=420.16s)]
*  Israel, it's working on behalf [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=421.64000000000004s)]
*  of America. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=423.04s)]
*  I mean, who says stuff like this [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=423.6s)]
*  with a straight face, okay? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=426.56s)]
*  So, but you go ahead, Israel and [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=429.8s)]
*  Israeli supporters, do your stupid [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=431.72s)]
*  obvious propaganda. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=434.12s)]
*  Now, you're getting caught by left, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=435.96s)]
*  right, middle, everyone. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=437.64s)]
*  No one believes a word you say [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=439.15999999999997s)]
*  anymore. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=440.52s)]
*  By the way, Israel also bragging [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=441.12s)]
*  about how they lied to the Iranians [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=442.56s)]
*  in a hundred different ways. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=444.24s)]
*  I get it, if you're going to do [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=445.8s)]
*  a surprise attack, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=446.64s)]
*  you're going to lie, etc. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=447.36s)]
*  But they also lied to their whole [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=448.56s)]
*  press and stuff. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=450.12s)]
*  Again, I get it, but remember, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=451.08s)]
*  the next time that Israel puts out [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=453.47999999999996s)]
*  a statement, it's incredibly [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=455.15999999999997s)]
*  likely that it's a lie. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=457.4s)]
*  And later, they will laugh at [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=460.12s)]
*  the press for helping them pull off [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=461.64s)]
*  a surprise attack and attack a [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=463.52000000000004s)]
*  sovereign country and start a giant [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=465.32s)]
*  war in the Middle East. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=467.48s)]
*  They've got the idiot American [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=469.04s)]
*  press, they'll just report anything [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=470.8s)]
*  we say as if we aren't giant liars [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=473.0s)]
*  and didn't lie every single time. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=475.12s)]
*  And sometimes like this, we lie, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=477.48s)]
*  we brag about how we lied to you [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=479.68s)]
*  and how you're our stenographers. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=481.6s)]
*  And you just told everyone the [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=484.28000000000003s)]
*  Israeli point of view and [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=485.88s)]
*  skewed everything in our behalf. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=487.24s)]
*  Yeah, I know, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=489.12s)]
*  that's American media. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=489.8s)]
*  Okay, so how are we going to get [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=490.92s)]
*  right into this? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=492.48s)]
*  We got an aircraft carrier there. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=493.48s)]
*  We got a bunch of Navy ships. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=495.36s)]
*  We got jets in the air. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=497.8s)]
*  And we got bases in the Middle [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=500.12s)]
*  East. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=501.96s)]
*  They do not have Iron Dome. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=502.68s)]
*  None of them are protected like [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=504.44s)]
*  Israel. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=505.88s)]
*  We're all sitting ducks there. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=506.44s)]
*  We got these giant ships just [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=508.08s)]
*  sitting in the middle of the sea [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=509.56s)]
*  waiting for a drone strike. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=511.08s)]
*  We got bases that are not at all. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=512.76s)]
*  I mean, they're protected in terms [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=514.6s)]
*  of having troops there, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=516.48s)]
*  in terms of having air cover. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=517.64s)]
*  But can they get hit because [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=519.56s)]
*  they're not protected by aerial [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=520.8s)]
*  cover like Iron Dome? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=522.56s)]
*  Yes, so basically Netanyahu told [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=523.88s)]
*  this moron Donald Trump, hey, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=525.68s)]
*  you know what, if I blow up [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=527.38s)]
*  the negotiation table, they're more [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=528.68s)]
*  likely to return to it. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=530.4s)]
*  If I murder everyone in their [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=531.4399999999999s)]
*  government, they're more likely to [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=532.68s)]
*  want to do a peace deal. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=534.3199999999999s)]
*  And Trump's like, okay. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=535.3599999999999s)]
*  Or he was like, okay, yeah, but [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=537.9599999999999s)]
*  how much are you bribing me? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=539.4s)]
*  You're bribing me a lot? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=541.1999999999999s)]
*  Okay, I already took Qatar's money. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=542.76s)]
*  I'll take more of your money. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=544.4399999999999s)]
*  Okay, sure, I'll do whatever war [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=545.4799999999999s)]
*  you want. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=546.68s)]
*  Who cares about the American [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=547.1999999999999s)]
*  people? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=548.1999999999999s)]
*  I said I was anti-war during [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=548.8s)]
*  the campaign. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=549.92s)]
*  And they didn't know I'm a giant [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=551.44s)]
*  liar. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=553.5600000000001s)]
*  And Maggie, what happened? [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=555.12s)]
*  He's a liar, right? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=556.6s)]
*  Or he's an idiot, pick one. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=557.8000000000001s)]
*  because he said anti-war and [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=560.4s)]
*  this ain't anti-war. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=562.24s)]
*  And he brings just like Israel [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=563.84s)]
*  wants, he brings our troops and [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=566.04s)]
*  our military to sit there like [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=568.36s)]
*  sitting ducks, inviting Iran to [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=570.64s)]
*  attack them so that we'll get [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=573.04s)]
*  sucked into another multi-trillion [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=575.08s)]
*  dollar war like Iraq. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=577.6800000000001s)]
*  Except Iran is four times [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=579.36s)]
*  the size of Iraq. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=580.84s)]
*  So if you thought the Iraq war [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=582.8000000000001s)]
*  cost us a lot in blood and [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=584.24s)]
*  treasure, wait till you see how [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=585.4s)]
*  much we lose in Iran. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=586.88s)]
*  Because we always have to do [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=588.6800000000001s)]
*  Israel's dirty work for them. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=589.96s)]
*  And are we already knee deep in [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=591.6800000000001s)]
*  this war? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=593.52s)]
*  No, golly gee, we didn't do it. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=594.4s)]
*  That brings me back to [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=596.84s)]
*  the Rubio statement. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=597.6s)]
*  Rubio statement is so important. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=598.5600000000001s)]
*  because despite the fact that he's [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=600.36s)]
*  bribed by AIPAC, he went out and [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=602.0s)]
*  said we didn't do this. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=603.76s)]
*  This was a unilateral strike by [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=605.72s)]
*  Israel, which I thought was really [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=607.5600000000001s)]
*  surprising because Rubio mainly [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=609.28s)]
*  is his job is to fillet Israel. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=611.0799999999999s)]
*  And so here he was going, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=613.72s)]
*  we got nothing to do with this. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=614.8s)]
*  So that was made it clear, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=616.48s)]
*  America did not authorize the [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=618.04s)]
*  attack. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=619.8s)]
*  Trump afterwards realized he looks [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=621.3199999999999s)]
*  weak, Netanyahu, as he was holding [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=624.0s)]
*  Netanyahu's chair for him, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=626.48s)]
*  Netanyahu was like, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=628.3199999999999s)]
*  you think you're the boss of me? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=629.4s)]
*  You told me not to attack. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=630.9599999999999s)]
*  Wall Street Journal reported that, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=632.48s)]
*  many people reported that. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=633.72s)]
*  So I ignored you, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=635.56s)]
*  because you're useless. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=636.72s)]
*  You're the American president, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=638.9599999999999s)]
*  I ordered the American president [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=640.3199999999999s)]
*  around all the time. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=641.52s)]
*  Democrat, Republican, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=642.9599999999999s)]
*  doesn't matter. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=643.72s)]
*  We're the boss of you. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=644.76s)]
*  So that's super embarrassing [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=646.36s)]
*  to Trump. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=647.68s)]
*  So he's like, I knew, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=648.68s)]
*  I knew it was an excellent attack. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=650.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, now why'd you have Rubio say [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=653.0s)]
*  it was unilateral and [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=654.4399999999999s)]
*  not has nothing new with us earlier? [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=655.4399999999999s)]
*  That shows you 100% that he did not [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=658.0799999999999s)]
*  authorize the attack, Netanyahu [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=660.3199999999999s)]
*  bitch slapped him across the face. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=662.72s)]
*  So what are you going to sit there, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=665.0799999999999s)]
*  bleed all day? [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=665.8399999999999s)]
*  Go do my propaganda for you, for me. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=666.92s)]
*  Boy, boy, go out there and [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=669.32s)]
*  tell them how excellent I am. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=671.36s)]
*  Then get your troops killed and [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=673.96s)]
*  fight my war for me, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=675.8s)]
*  just like you did in Iraq. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=677.0s)]
*  And Trump said, okay, okay, sir. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=679.2s)]
*  Okay, sir, is the money still [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=680.92s)]
*  coming? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=682.2s)]
*  A pack and the aid also says the [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=682.72s)]
*  money's still coming? [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=683.96s)]
*  Anti-war my ass, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=685.32s)]
*  I told you it wasn't anti-war. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=686.52s)]
*  Look, I'm encouraging the, yes, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=688.68s)]
*  by the way, the left, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=690.56s)]
*  Tucker Carlson, we're going to talk [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=691.68s)]
*  about it later in the program. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=693.2s)]
*  Tucker Carlson and other people we [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=694.3199999999999s)]
*  massively disagree with saying, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=696.56s)]
*  yeah, Trump got tricked. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=698.8399999999999s)]
*  He's complicit in this. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=701.04s)]
*  So yes, you should get their base [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=703.3199999999999s)]
*  angry, they should be angry. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=705.4399999999999s)]
*  They voted anti-war, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=707.6s)]
*  they didn't get anti-war. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=708.9599999999999s)]
*  And Mago, we're going to find out [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=711.0799999999999s)]
*  who you are. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=712.1999999999999s)]
*  And finally, if you think, well, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=712.92s)]
*  it was just defense. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=714.92s)]
*  I mean, poor, poor, poor, poor, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=716.0799999999999s)]
*  poor, poor Israel had to be [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=717.9599999999999s)]
*  defended against those monstrous [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=719.48s)]
*  Muslims who were counterattacking. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=721.48s)]
*  Okay, it turns out today we find [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=724.0s)]
*  out we also provided intelligence [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=726.36s)]
*  for the attack. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=729.0s)]
*  Now we didn't know necessarily [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=730.28s)]
*  that they were going to use that [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=732.0s)]
*  intelligence to do the attack, but [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=733.64s)]
*  we did provide intelligence. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=735.64s)]
*  Oops, so that means we were part of [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=737.4399999999999s)]
*  the offense and the defense. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=739.24s)]
*  That means we're in the middle of [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=741.48s)]
*  the war right now. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=743.16s)]
*  How easy was it for Netanyahu to [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=744.16s)]
*  trick or bribe the simple minded [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=746.76s)]
*  Donald Trump into being massively [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=749.48s)]
*  pro-war and dragging us into [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=752.32s)]
*  another giant war in the Middle [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=754.4000000000001s)]
*  East, which is the exact opposite [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=756.5600000000001s)]
*  of what he promised, Moz. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=759.1600000000001s)]
*  You know, Donald Trump is at once [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=761.32s)]
*  an unintelligent child and [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=763.44s)]
*  a madman combined. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=765.1600000000001s)]
*  He said that it was the Iranian [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=766.48s)]
*  Empire, it was the Persian Empire. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=768.24s)]
*  He also famously didn't seem to [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=770.5600000000001s)]
*  care about Iran when he was going [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=772.6s)]
*  to visit the Gulf countries. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=774.7600000000001s)]
*  And he had said that he was going [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=776.84s)]
*  to claim that the name of the [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=778.48s)]
*  Persian Gulf is the Arabian Gulf, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=779.8800000000001s)]
*  because he wanted to play into [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=781.56s)]
*  the hands of the Gulf countries. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=783.12s)]
*  So I don't know if he really cares [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=785.84s)]
*  about the Iranian people. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=787.76s)]
*  I actually doubt it simply because [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=789.28s)]
*  if you remember in 2020, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=791.48s)]
*  John Bolton backed him into [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=793.16s)]
*  possibly going to war with Iran [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=794.92s)]
*  when they killed General Soleimani. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=797.04s)]
*  And at that time, as the tensions [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=800.04s)]
*  were escalating between Iran and [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=802.36s)]
*  America, Trump came out and [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=804.72s)]
*  was warning the Iranian government [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=806.64s)]
*  that he would bomb Iran and [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=809.0799999999999s)]
*  bomb their historical sites, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=810.96s)]
*  which have nothing to do with this [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=812.9200000000001s)]
*  regime, this Islamic Republic of [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=814.88s)]
*  Iran. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=816.8000000000001s)]
*  It's what Iranians are proud of. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=817.32s)]
*  And he said, I will bomb those [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=819.0400000000001s)]
*  sites of yours. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=820.6s)]
*  So I don't know how much he cares [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=821.52s)]
*  for the Iranian people. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=823.6s)]
*  He certainly is again, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=825.88s)]
*  unintelligent in the fact that he's [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=827.36s)]
*  saying, well, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=829.44s)]
*  they killed my negotiators, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=830.4000000000001s)]
*  they killed the hardliners. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=832.0s)]
*  There weren't only five [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=833.72s)]
*  hardliners. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=835.0400000000001s)]
*  The whole Islamic Republic regime [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=836.2800000000001s)]
*  are hardliners. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=838.76s)]
*  And so it's not like once you kill [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=840.44s)]
*  these guys, then everything's [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=842.4000000000001s)]
*  solved. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=844.2800000000001s)]
*  Then proof of that is when we [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=844.8000000000001s)]
*  killed Soleimani in 2020, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=846.5200000000001s)]
*  this guy Salami who just called [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=848.12s)]
*  Salami who just was killed now [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=849.9200000000001s)]
*  with these strikes, he just took [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=851.72s)]
*  over. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=853.84s)]
*  Another hardliner comes in and [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=854.36s)]
*  takes over. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=856.36s)]
*  And then to your point of did he [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=857.32s)]
*  know, did he not know, did we know, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=859.08s)]
*  did we not know, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=861.24s)]
*  there's only two options. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=862.2800000000001s)]
*  Either he didn't know and [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=864.0s)]
*  he got played, or he did know and [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=865.6400000000001s)]
*  he played along and we played [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=867.84s)]
*  along and we pretended that we [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=869.8s)]
*  were going to go negotiate in [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=871.56s)]
*  which case we are duplicitous and [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=873.3199999999999s)]
*  we're saying that we can't trust [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=875.3199999999999s)]
*  the Iranians, well, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=877.28s)]
*  can the Iranians trust us? [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=878.64s)]
*  Because from now on anything we [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=880.3199999999999s)]
*  say and do is totally unbelievable [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=882.8399999999999s)]
*  because is it real, is it not real? [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=885.76s)]
*  Are we really coming to, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=888.9599999999999s)]
*  how do they know if they come to [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=890.4s)]
*  actually if they sat down at [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=892.24s)]
*  a negotiation table that snipers [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=893.8399999999999s)]
*  wouldn't come in and take out [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=895.68s)]
*  their negotiators again? [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=897.1999999999999s)]
*  Because America go to them into it. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=898.64s)]
*  I mean, this is constantly again, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=900.88s)]
*  what's going on and in terms of [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=903.4s)]
*  the attacks without a second idea [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=906.04s)]
*  about what are we going to do next? [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=908.4399999999999s)]
*  And Netanyahu has been jonesing for [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=911.12s)]
*  this for years. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=913.92s)]
*  He's been jonesing for [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=915.48s)]
*  this for years. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=916.84s)]
*  Let's not forget Netanyahu has got [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=917.68s)]
*  his own problems, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=919.68s)]
*  criminal prosecutions in Israel. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=920.68s)]
*  He's got those hardliners he's in [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=922.92s)]
*  bed with and again, killing tens of [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=924.88s)]
*  thousands of innocent Gazans. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=927.3199999999999s)]
*  So he needs to keep this going, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=930.4s)]
*  keep this level of emergency going. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=932.48s)]
*  This is a vital thing, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=935.04s)]
*  we need to keep going. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=936.3199999999999s)]
*  They have all the arms they need. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=937.76s)]
*  And Trump just told you, [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=940.48s)]
*  they're going to give them more [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=941.52s)]
*  arms. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=942.76s)]
*  And so it really is from the outside, [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=943.28s)]
*  I honestly I'm perplexed that [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=945.64s)]
*  there's not somebody inside [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=947.4399999999999s)]
*  the administration who taps them [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=949.24s)]
*  and goes, hey dude, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=951.24s)]
*  you're falling for a trap. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=952.48s)]
*  Don't fall for a trap. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=954.68s)]
*  But again, he's very easily [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=955.96s)]
*  convinced to do many things. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=957.72s)]
*  We looked at the fact that he, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=959.6800000000001s)]
*  brought those Afrikaners in. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=961.9200000000001s)]
*  Somebody was in his ear saying, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=964.08s)]
*  hey, bring these Afrikaners that [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=965.72s)]
*  are being persecuted in South Africa. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=967.4000000000001s)]
*  Bring them, let them come in and [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=970.0400000000001s)]
*  be refugees. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=971.1600000000001s)]
*  And so similarly, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=972.2s)]
*  someone's in his ear, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=973.24s)]
*  Netanyahu's in his ear saying, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=974.1600000000001s)]
*  hey, don't worry, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=975.6800000000001s)]
*  we'll bomb them and [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=976.64s)]
*  it'll help the negotiations. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=977.6s)]
*  And here we are, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=979.5600000000001s)]
*  it's not even, it's just, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=980.36s)]
*  not even, it hasn't even been 24 [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=981.48s)]
*  hours and it's just escalating and [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=982.88s)]
*  getting worse and worse. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=984.92s)]
*  So I'm just going to make [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=986.36s)]
*  a tiny point here. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=987.12s)]
*  Just as you watch the coverage, [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=988.4399999999999s)]
*  I want you to look out to see if [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=989.8s)]
*  this happens. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=990.92s)]
*  If Iran had struck first and they [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=991.88s)]
*  had hit in Jerusalem and killed 78 [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=994.68s)]
*  people, mostly civilians and [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=997.68s)]
*  over 200 injured, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=1000.4799999999999s)]
*  what would they have called [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3TFnhLdSV4&t=1001.8399999999999s)]
