Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

# Trump Admin Says Man's BRUTAL Deportation Was An 'Error'
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [April 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ)
*  I trust our intelligence agencies and the intelligence individuals that are within the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Department of Homeland Security. That the individuals who are there are members and [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  a part of this organization and have worked with them. And while we were there at that prison, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=8.56s)]
*  we not only talked about how to identify these members of these terrorist organizations, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=13.76s)]
*  but what they did, their actions they took, the case files we built on them and how we [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=19.2s)]
*  verified that those individuals should be there in that prison. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=23.12s)]
*  So you're pretty confident. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=26.48s)]
*  We'll continue to do that. I am. I am very confident in the fact that those individuals [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=26.959999999999997s)]
*  that are there should be there. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=30.799999999999997s)]
*  They say that confidence is oftentimes a good thing, but in some contexts, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=33.92s)]
*  not such a great thing. Maybe you should cross your T's, dot your I's because [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=38.239999999999995s)]
*  Homeland Security Secretary Christine Ohm was apparently wrong to trust the intelligence [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=43.84s)]
*  process being used to decide who would be deported to a terrorist detention facility in El Salvador. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  Because last night, the Trump administration in a court filing admitted to mistakenly [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=56.48s)]
*  deporting a man with legal protections because of an administrative error. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=63.199999999999996s)]
*  So let's get into the details of this story. And there's a lot of talk online. It's hard to [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=68.32s)]
*  cut through all of it to get to the bottom of what's really going on here. But here's what [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=72.72s)]
*  the reality is. Believe it or not, they are still defending the decision to deport this guy despite [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=77.6s)]
*  admitting to screwing up. But before we get to that, here are the initial details. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=83.68s)]
*  Here's the context. So the man in question is Kilmar Abrego Garcia. So he actually came to [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=90.64s)]
*  the United States in 2011 at the age of 16 after fleeing gang threats in his home country of El [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=97.04s)]
*  Salvador. Now he's married to a United States citizen and has a five-year-old child with autism, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=104.88000000000001s)]
*  who is also, of course, a US citizen. Now he was living in Maryland, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=110.72s)]
*  and he has absolutely no criminal record. He was living in the United States under [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=114.32s)]
*  protected legal status, protected legal status. He was not in the country illegally, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=119.84s)]
*  so it's important to remember that. And he even regularly complied with ICE check-ins. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=125.52s)]
*  Now in 2019, officials from the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency tried to deport him. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=131.68s)]
*  So this is when Trump was still in office in his first term. During those proceedings, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=137.2s)]
*  they claimed a confidential informant had told them that Abrego Garcia was a high-ranking member [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=142.16s)]
*  of MS-13, the violent Salvadorian criminal gang, which of course he and his lawyer said was [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=148.48s)]
*  completely false. According to the Atlantic, the gang label stems from a 2019 incident when [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=154.07999999999998s)]
*  Garcia and three other men were detained in a Home Depot parking lot by a police detective [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=160.64s)]
*  in Prince George's County, Maryland. During questioning, one of the men told officers that [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=166.08s)]
*  Abrego Garcia was a gang member, but the man offered absolutely no proof, and police said they [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=171.44000000000003s)]
*  didn't believe him, filing show. Police did not identify him as a gang member. Now he wasn't [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=177.92000000000002s)]
*  charged with any crime, but unfortunately got handed over to ICE, who then tried to send him [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=183.92000000000002s)]
*  back to El Salvador. Garcia appealed, I should say, the claims that he was a danger to the [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=190.4s)]
*  community and filed a petition for asylum. He was granted withholding from removal status [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=197.6s)]
*  in October of 2019 by an immigration judge, which protected him from being deported to El Salvador. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=203.36s)]
*  Because of the likelihood that he could be harmed if he returned back to El Salvador, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=209.84s)]
*  where gang members were threatening his life. Now before I get to more of the details here, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=215.6s)]
*  Cenk, I mean, this guy pretty much has gone through hell. I mean, he gets accused of being [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=220.08s)]
*  part of a gang. There's no evidence of it. The police say that he wasn't guilty of any kind of [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=227.04000000000002s)]
*  crime. He has no criminal record. Long story short, he gets sent over to El Salvador to the [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=231.84s)]
*  CICOT facility anyway during the second Trump term. And we're about to get to all the details [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=237.84s)]
*  about the denials from Vice President JD Vance about this. Even though lawyers representing the [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=243.68s)]
*  administration have admitted that this error was in fact made. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=249.28s)]
*  Okay, so several outrageous facts here. Guys, he was just trying to escape [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=252.64000000000001s)]
*  gangs in El Salvador. Who do you think is in that prison in El Salvador? Those same exact gangs. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=260.32s)]
*  So we might have sent him to his death. It's amazing fact number two. They say [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=267.92s)]
*  we have no jurisdiction over El Salvador, so we can't get him back. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=273.04s)]
*  Insane, insane. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=276.40000000000003s)]
*  Then if we can't get people back from El Salvador, we obviously shouldn't be sending people [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=278.32s)]
*  to El Salvador. Well, I mean, is it impossible for anyone to make a mistake? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=283.36s)]
*  The Trump administration, what if the next administration comes in? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=288.24s)]
*  What a democratic administration can't make a mistake, but no, let's just send them to a dungeon [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=291.12s)]
*  we can't get them back from. What if you sent the wrong guy? In fact, it's not a what if anymore. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=295.44s)]
*  They definitely sent the wrong guy. And this isn't even talking about the gay hairdresser. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=299.6s)]
*  That's a different guy, okay? So this guy, one of the reasons he was rounded up at Home Depot, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=303.6s)]
*  by the way, as he was applying for a job, was because he had a Chicago Bulls hat and hoodie. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=308.08000000000004s)]
*  Under that standard, how many people can we round up and send to El Salvador? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=315.76000000000005s)]
*  I mean, that's beyond, that's even more mental than the hairdresser's mom and dad tattoos that [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=320.88s)]
*  got him sent to El Salvador. It's crazy. It's absolutely crazy. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=326.40000000000003s)]
*  And remember the clip we showed you in the beginning with Christina? Oh, we got this on [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=329.12s)]
*  lockdown. Our intelligence is top notch. They're barely checking, guys. It's all for photo ops, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=332.8s)]
*  right? And Christina goes down there and does a photo op with her Rolex, etc. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=339.44s)]
*  And wait till you hear about his traffic tickets. So there's a lot more madness in this story. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=343.28000000000003s)]
*  There is, but I just wanna take a brief moment to reiterate something I've been saying on the show. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=348.56s)]
*  Look, the Trump administration has had quite a bit of support from the American people in regard to [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=354.88s)]
*  doing these deportations. Not the deportations of people who weren't meant to be deported, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=360.08s)]
*  but obviously of criminals, of gang members, people who are in the country illegally. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=366.47999999999996s)]
*  They are going to waste that goodwill by making these errors and they keep saying, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=371.28s)]
*  well, we wanna get it done. We wanna get it done. Let's get them out. Let's get them out. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=375.91999999999996s)]
*  But due process is incredibly important in order to prevent these types of mistakes from happening. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=378.96s)]
*  Because if you have a situation in which the executive branch can just unilaterally point [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=386.32s)]
*  to someone and accuse them of anything, and that individual gets no due process, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=390.32s)]
*  well, what kind of government is that? And yes, even people who are in the country illegally, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=394.8s)]
*  this guy was not in the country illegally, I wanna be clear about that. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=399.68s)]
*  But even for people who are in the country illegally, if the president or if anyone in [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=402.4s)]
*  the executive branch is going to accuse that individual of being part of a criminal gang, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=406.8s)]
*  and that is their justification for sending them to a third country, like El Salvador, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=411.52s)]
*  to sit in a terrorist facility full of other incredibly violent gang members and stuff like [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=416.32s)]
*  that. That is terrible to do without due process, without having a judge look at the facts and [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=421.84s)]
*  adjudicate whether or not that individual is actually guilty of doing or being what the [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=428.64s)]
*  executive branch is claiming here. Yeah, and JD Vance, we'll show in a minute, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=434.4s)]
*  lied about due process in a pretty egregious way. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=438.64s)]
*  But what I wanted to point out is to go along with what Anna is saying. Both sides should [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=442.23999999999995s)]
*  really agree with us for two different, well, maybe the same reason, but certainly overlapping. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=447.11999999999995s)]
*  So the left in the middle, of course, we don't wanna send innocent people to a [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=451.2s)]
*  prison in El Salvador, that's nuts. And of course, we're in favor of due process. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=454.79999999999995s)]
*  Those are not open questions on the left in the middle. So for the folks on the right, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=458.32s)]
*  first of all, come on, brothers. I mean, you claim to be in favor of the constitution. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=462.0s)]
*  Due process should not be an open question for you either. Okay, but to Anna's point, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=465.91999999999996s)]
*  even if you say, it is an open question, I don't really care too much about due process. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=470.48s)]
*  Or what aboutism, Biden did this, Obama, whatever excuses you have, right? Okay, no problem. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=475.44s)]
*  But then listen to what she's saying. This is going to make the program that you love to deport [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=480.32s)]
*  criminal undocumented gang members unpopular, because everybody's gonna hear you're sending [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=485.68s)]
*  the wrong guys. By the way, that's the same thing that happened in death penalty. The death penalty [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=491.12s)]
*  was relatively popular until we found out that we were executing innocent people. And then it [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=495.52000000000004s)]
*  became unpopular. So okay, if you want your program to be unpopular and you want the criminal [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=499.44s)]
*  gang members to stay here, keep going in this direction. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=505.04s)]
*  Here's another scenario that I want you guys to think about. If anyone who's watching this [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=507.44s)]
*  right now thinks, well, I don't want due process for someone who's in the country illegally, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=513.44s)]
*  right? Which by the way, our constitution does protect everyone in the country, even if they're [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=517.84s)]
*  not here with citizen status, they're supposed to get due process and we should protect that. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=521.76s)]
*  Now, why do I say we should protect that? Well, I mean, if you guys can recall not too long ago, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=526.8000000000001s)]
*  Steve Bannon accused Elon Musk of being an illegal immigrant. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=532.08s)]
*  So if Steve Bannon had more power than he currently has and was able to get in Donald [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=536.96s)]
*  Trump's ear and convince him to deport Elon Musk to CICOT, right? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=542.48s)]
*  That's actually literally nothing you can do about it. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=547.6800000000001s)]
*  There's nothing, I mean, Elon Musk, by the way, would deserve his day in court, right? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=549.6s)]
*  Where he can prove actually, no, I'm an American citizen, here's the evidence, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=553.6s)]
*  that's what due process is. But under the system that some, unfortunately, in the country are now [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=557.12s)]
*  rooting for, anyone in the executive branch, anyone in Homeland Security can just point to [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=562.48s)]
*  any individual, accuse them of anything and without a day in court, even if they're an [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=566.96s)]
*  American citizen, we're gonna send you to El Salvador. Is that the country we wanna live in? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=570.32s)]
*  Because I don't wanna live in that country. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=574.4s)]
*  See, that's why it's important for non-citizens to have due process rights. Because if you just call [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=576.16s)]
*  someone a non-citizen and take away their due process, you don't even know if they are [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=580.88s)]
*  citizen or not. Bannon would say that Musk is not a citizen. Musk, in fact, is a citizen. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=584.32s)]
*  But once you send him to El Salvador, you can't even get him back. So, I mean, look, we get it, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=589.84s)]
*  they're not gonna do that to Musk, he's a billionaire, etc., right? But they could do it [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=595.6s)]
*  to anyone if you allow them to take away due process for anyone. And by the way, that's why [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=600.08s)]
*  the Supreme Court has ruled over and over again over the course of hundreds of years [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=605.52s)]
*  that yes, due process and constitutional rights also apply to non-citizens. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=609.76s)]
*  For example, if you're a non-citizen, you also can't get tortured, you're protected by the [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=613.76s)]
*  constitution. Exactly. So let's get to the rest of this story. So as I had last mentioned, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=617.52s)]
*  he was granted withholding from removal status in October of 2019 by an immigration judge. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=623.4399999999999s)]
*  Because of the likelihood that he could be harmed if he returned to his home country of El Salvador. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=630.0s)]
*  Now that ruling specifically meant that he could still be deported in the future, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=634.72s)]
*  but not to El Salvador where the judge agreed he'd be in danger. But on March 12th, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=638.96s)]
*  Abrego Garcia had picked up his son after work when ICE officers stopped the car and [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=644.48s)]
*  incorrectly told him that his protected status had changed despite knowing that that was not the case. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=651.84s)]
*  Now officers waited for him or his wife, I should say, to come to the scene and take [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=659.12s)]
*  care of his son and then they drove him away in handcuffs. Within two days, he had been transferred [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=664.32s)]
*  to an ICE staging facility in the state of Texas. Then he was sent on a plane to CICOT [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=669.6800000000001s)]
*  in El Salvador despite his protection status still being active. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=677.36s)]
*  Now the Trump administration is actually admitting in a court filing that he was deported because of [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=682.1600000000001s)]
*  an administrative error. So let's get to those details. Abrego Garcia was not on the initial [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=687.7600000000001s)]
*  manifest of the deportation flight but was listed as an alternate, the government attorneys [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=693.12s)]
*  explained. As other detainees were removed from the flight for various reasons, he moved up the [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=698.64s)]
*  list. The flight manifest did not indicate that he should not be removed, the attorney said. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=705.52s)]
*  Through administrative error, Abrego Garcia was removed from the United States to El Salvador. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=712.88s)]
*  This was an oversight. But despite this, they told the court that Abrego Garcia's deportation [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=718.72s)]
*  was carried out in good faith. So the man's wife and his relatives ended up filing a civil suit [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=724.88s)]
*  against the Trump administration last month, asking the government to stop its payments to El [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=731.52s)]
*  Salvador for holding deportees until Abrego Garcia is returned. Because remember, we're not just [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=737.0400000000001s)]
*  sending people to El Salvador to this detention facility. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=744.0s)]
*  We're also paying El Salvador to do this. In Monday's court filing, administration officials [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=747.76s)]
*  balked at the request, claiming the United States courts did not have jurisdiction to order such [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=753.76s)]
*  actions and saying Abrego Garcia's plight should not stand in the way of the Trump administration's [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=760.16s)]
*  greater foreign policy goals. Listen, if your greater foreign policy goals mean that you're [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=766.16s)]
*  gonna strip people of due process and constitutional rights, your foreign policy goals are gonna fall [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=771.68s)]
*  by the wayside. It's not that difficult. There is a process in place. Go through the process [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=777.4399999999999s)]
*  to ensure that you're not deporting the wrong people and stories like this don't pop up, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=784.0s)]
*  which makes the Trump administration look really, really bad. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=789.04s)]
*  Now let's talk about the administration's response to all of this. So it seems like the Trump [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=792.4799999999999s)]
*  administration's strategy today is to basically keep moving the goalpost and adjust their talking [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=796.64s)]
*  points as they get confronted about the fact that they made a massive mistake here. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=802.16s)]
*  So John Favreau tweeted at Trump officials last night writing, any comment on this? And he tagged [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=808.08s)]
*  Marco Rubio. How about you, JD Vance, Elon Musk? You just admitted to accidentally sending an [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=813.52s)]
*  innocent father from Maryland to a torture dungeon in El Salvador and you refused to do anything [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=819.28s)]
*  about it. Now this is where Vice President JD Vance comes in and I'm really ashamed of how [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=825.28s)]
*  he's handling this. He says, my comment is that according to the court document you apparently [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=831.76s)]
*  didn't read, he was a convicted MS-13 gang member with no legal right to be here. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=837.04s)]
*  Okay, that is false. He was fleeing gang violence in El Salvador and received protected status in [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=842.8s)]
*  the United States as a result of that. The court document he's referring to says he was denied [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=849.68s)]
*  bond in 2019 over an informants claim that he was a member of MS-13. But that is not a conviction, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=854.96s)]
*  obviously. When reporter Kyle Cheney pointed that out to JD Vance, he didn't acknowledge the fact [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=862.96s)]
*  that he was dead wrong about the man being convicted. He remained defiant, here's what he [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=869.6s)]
*  wrote. Bear with me here, Kyle Cheney, a legal affairs reporter is apparently unable or unwilling [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=875.2800000000001s)]
*  to look at the facts here. In 2019, an immigration judge under the first Trump administration [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=881.52s)]
*  determined that the deported man was in fact a member of the MS-13 gang. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=886.88s)]
*  He didn't. He also apparently had multiple traffic violations for which he failed to appear in court, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=891.6s)]
*  a real winner. It is telling that the entire American media is going to run a propaganda [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=900.0799999999999s)]
*  operation today, making you think an innocent father of three was apprehended by a gulag. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=905.36s)]
*  Here are the relevant facts. The man is an illegal immigrant with no right to be in the country. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=911.1199999999999s)]
*  This is me saying it now, false, what he's claiming there is false. An immigration judge [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=916.16s)]
*  determined he was a member of the MS-13 gang, also false. Because he is not a citizen, he does not [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=921.1199999999999s)]
*  get a full jury trial by peers. In other words, whatever due process he was entitled to, he [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=927.92s)]
*  received. Well, he did receive due process, but you guys deported him anyway. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=933.4399999999999s)]
*  Thereby removing the due process. So when the judge says he's protected, he should stay here. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=939.76s)]
*  He's got a valid claim and he's married to an American, etc., etc. If you ignore the judge's [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=948.3199999999999s)]
*  ruling, you're ignoring due process. Here's the thing you gotta know about JD Vance. He went [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=955.1999999999999s)]
*  to Yale Law. So it's not like he doesn't know, he knows, right? This is pretty elementary stuff you [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=960.8s)]
*  learn in law school. So he's choosing to lie, that's really interesting. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=967.2800000000001s)]
*  And if you remember with the eating the cats and dogs nonsense during the election, [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=971.44s)]
*  JD Vance said, well, I had to do that to propel my agenda. He just flat out admitted it, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=975.6s)]
*  that they were lying about the cats and the dogs to get us to talk about the real problem [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=980.5600000000001s)]
*  of immigration. Or you could just talk about the real problem of immigration, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=985.44s)]
*  which pulled really well for you guys. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=989.12s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=990.72s)]
*  Yeah, so now instead of getting everybody riled up, again, if you're a right winger, [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=991.6800000000001s)]
*  I would argue you should be more mad. One, you should care about the Constitution. But two, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=996.08s)]
*  you had everybody all riled up about the illegal immigrants here who had broken laws and the gangs, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=1000.4000000000001s)]
*  etc. Massively popular for Trump. The border was getting close to sealed, it was amazing. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=1006.08s)]
*  And so you agree or disagree with that. The American people agreed, right? And that's the [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=1014.24s)]
*  one thing holding up Trump's polling numbers, because he's now cratering on the economy. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=1021.12s)]
*  Elon Musk is causing him significant damage with blind cuts that are not popular, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=1026.24s)]
*  but he was doing great on immigration. Now you're flushing it down the toilet with outrageous, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=1031.2s)]
*  clear lies. Okay, let's say that JD Vance read the first thing wrong and it's a little embarrassing [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=1037.36s)]
*  because he went to Yale Law and is the vice president. He shouldn't be saying all this stuff [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=1043.36s)]
*  without checking. Remember, he's saying his own administration is wrong. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=1048.88s)]
*  The Trump administration said, no, we made a mistake. I said we made a mistake, he should be [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=1053.0400000000002s)]
*  here. And Vance is like, no way, man. He's a criminal and he's this and he's that. But brother, [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=1058.3200000000002s)]
*  you didn't even check and you're contradicting yourself, your own administration. Super [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=1064.48s)]
*  embarrassing. But even then, maybe like he rushed because they rush everything, they're super sloppy, [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=1069.3600000000001s)]
*  etc, right? But the second tweet when you knew for 100%, the one that Ana just read you guys, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=1075.52s)]
*  you knew for 100% that you were wrong and he did it anyway. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=1082.56s)]
*  Exactly. And look, we went through, and I think to some extent are still going through this era [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=1086.32s)]
*  of rewarding people who refuse to take personal responsibility or any responsibility. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=1093.36s)]
*  Where denials and refusals to apologize are somehow seen as strong and are rewarded. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=1098.48s)]
*  But I see that culture slowly but surely fading away. And I'm seeing this thirst among the [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=1106.64s)]
*  American people for politicians who are willing to admit fault, who are willing to say, you know [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=1112.56s)]
*  what, we made a mistake here. We have learned from that mistake and we're going to change the [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=1118.72s)]
*  process to make sure this doesn't happen again. That's way more admirable than whatever this is [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=1124.08s)]
*  that JD Vance is doing, right? Cuz I get it. I understand that urge to not want to admit fault. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=1129.36s)]
*  I totally get it. It's human nature. But you should be leading by example, okay? We're talking about [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=1134.56s)]
*  the most powerful people in the country and the fish rots from the head down. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=1140.96s)]
*  Leading by example, taking personal responsibility and showing that you're gonna do things [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=1145.84s)]
*  differently so these mistakes don't happen again is way more admirable than what JD Vance is doing. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=1149.76s)]
*  Yeah, and you know you're losing and making stuff up when you have to go to his traffic tickets. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=1154.4s)]
*  Come on, brother. I mean, also I heard unconfirmed reports that he was jaywalking earlier. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=1159.68s)]
*  That's when you know they're making it up. It doesn't matter what side they're on, right? [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=1164.88s)]
*  And so, Ana, let me just double down on what you said because the media has changed, guys. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=1168.56s)]
*  You're gonna hear me say this a lot cuz it is what's the cause of it. So in the old days, [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=1175.6s)]
*  Fox News would have just repeated what JD Vance said. They wouldn't care at all. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=1179.76s)]
*  They would have just said, yes, of course, he's undocumented, he's illegal, he's a criminal, [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=1183.6799999999998s)]
*  he's MS-13. They would just repeat it like 2,000 times until everyone in the right wing [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=1189.28s)]
*  genuinely believed he was MS-13, etc, right? Now there's a lot of shows that go, wow, that's weird. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=1194.7199999999998s)]
*  Because remember, they love proving the government wrong. Those guys on the right [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=1201.6799999999998s)]
*  and the bros and all that stuff. And with COVID and all that, they got all amped up, [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=1205.6799999999998s)]
*  Epstein files, etc. They're all sluice now. Sometimes, a lot of times they get it wrong, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=1209.76s)]
*  right? But at least they're trying to solve it. So then they look into the things and we're gonna [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=1214.32s)]
*  show JD Vance is right and they look through the papers like, god damn it, he's wrong again, [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=1218.56s)]
*  right? And so is it every show? No way you'll get the Benny Johnson's coming out there and telling [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=1224.08s)]
*  you he's MS-14, a new thing they just discovered, right? But now a lot of their own shows are going, [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=1228.4s)]
*  that's not true. Why do you keep saying, I thought we were right. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=1235.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=1238.48s)]
*  Why do you keep lying if we're right, right? And they're starting to get mad about that. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=1239.2s)]
*  So that's a wonderful phenomenon. Now back to bad news, I wanna just one member here at tyt.com. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=1244.0s)]
*  Dr. Gonsal said, then people wonder why Canadians stopped traveling to the USA. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=1249.68s)]
*  You couldn't pay me to set one single tone in America right now. I wouldn't come within 100 [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=1254.16s)]
*  feet of your border. When I read that, I thought, Dr. Gonsal, a little much, right? We're fine here. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=1258.0s)]
*  I mean, the real problem is gun control. I mean, much higher chance of getting shot here in America [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=1264.4s)]
*  than almost any other country. Okay, but then I thought about it. I was like, wait a minute. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=1269.44s)]
*  If you're from Latin America or South America, or even Spain or Portugal or Italy, [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=1274.3200000000002s)]
*  or wherever you're from, and God help you if you have tattoos or a Chicago Bulls jersey. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=1280.4s)]

*  round you up and send you to El Salvador? Then you can't go back to Italy or Peru or wherever [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=1297.68s)]
*  you came from. Not good. That's insane. Yeah. So yeah, that'll hurt tourism, that'll hurt our [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=1302.72s)]
*  reputation, that'll hurt everything. This is just bad on every front. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTo2f8GuxQ&t=1308.88s)]
