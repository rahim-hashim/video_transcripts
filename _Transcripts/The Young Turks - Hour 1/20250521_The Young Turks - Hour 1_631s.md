"Republican leaders are increasingly confident they will be able to notch a final deal with key GOP megabill holdouts and move toward a final vote in the coming days after several whirlwind hours of closely held negotiations.

The upbeat turn in the frequently tumultuous talks was described by six senior Republicans who are participating in them. It came after President Donald Trump visited Capitol Hill Tuesday morning to personally urge the warring factions to drop their demands and come to an agreement on the sprawling domestic-policy bill centered on a multi-trillion-dollar suite of tax cuts."

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

# Trump Goes SCORCHED EARTH On Republicans Holding Out On Budget Bill
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [May 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ)
*  I don't think Thomas Massey [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=0.0s)]
*  understands government. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=1.36s)]
*  I think he's a grandstander, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  frankly. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  He'll probably vote. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=5.08s)]
*  We don't even talk to him much. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=6.68s)]
*  I think he should be voted out of [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=7.8s)]
*  office. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=9.24s)]
*  And I just don't think he [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=9.76s)]
*  understands government. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  If you ask him a couple of [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=12.36s)]
*  questions, he never gives you [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=13.32s)]
*  an answer. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=14.48s)]
*  He just says, I'm a no. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=15.0s)]
*  He thinks he's going to get [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=16.52s)]
*  publicity. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=17.48s)]
*  And you have that. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=18.72s)]
*  There you have President Donald [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=21.52s)]
*  Trump once again attacking [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=23.2s)]
*  Libertarian Congressman Thomas [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=24.78s)]
*  Massey, who is not in favor of [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=26.8s)]
*  Trump's agenda, particularly the big, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=29.48s)]
*  beautiful reconciliation bill that [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=32.36s)]
*  includes massive tax cuts, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=35.12s)]
*  in addition to hundreds of billions [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=37.28s)]
*  of dollars in additional spending [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=39.96s)]
*  for the border. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  Now, Thomas Massey is one of those [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=44.0s)]
*  rare lawmakers who, granted, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=46.2s)]
*  I don't agree with him on a whole [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=48.4s)]
*  host of issues, but [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=50.4s)]
*  he's principled. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  He says that he's worried about [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  the deficit and rather than just [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=55.0s)]
*  pretending like he's worried about [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=56.6s)]
*  the deficit. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=58.4s)]
*  Now, he puts his money where his [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=59.44s)]
*  mouth is, and he's willing to take [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=61.16s)]
*  the attacks by all the people who [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=63.28s)]
*  want him to vote yes by voting no. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=65.24s)]
*  And he's public about it, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=67.6s)]
*  he's honest about it. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=69.03999999999999s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=70.44s)]
*  Even if I don't agree with his [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=71.32s)]
*  politics, I commend him for [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=72.92s)]
*  being a principled politician. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=74.48s)]
*  And because he's a principled [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=76.88s)]
*  politician, all these attacks by [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=78.68s)]
*  Donald Trump don't work. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=80.72s)]
*  Trump has tried to primary him, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=82.92s)]
*  doesn't work. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=84.4s)]
*  It just doesn't work because guess [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=85.32s)]
*  Thomas Massey has proven that he [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=87.8s)]
*  believes in what he's saying, and [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=89.67999999999999s)]
*  he actually cares more about [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=91.72s)]
*  his constituents as opposed to [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=93.39999999999999s)]
*  carrying out policies that might be [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=95.32s)]
*  great for political donors or for [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=97.56s)]
*  the whole of the Republican Party. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=99.67999999999999s)]
*  He actually cares about the deficit. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=102.12s)]
*  Now, putting Thomas Massey aside, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=105.88s)]
*  let's talk a little bit about where [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=107.96s)]
*  the current negotiations are as it [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=109.88s)]
*  pertains to the House budget bill, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=111.8s)]
*  right? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=113.92s)]
*  So this is the bill that includes [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=114.42s)]
*  the tax cuts and [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=116.36s)]
*  funding for the border. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=117.5s)]
*  So there are divides among [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=120.32000000000001s)]
*  the Republican caucus over [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=121.6s)]
*  the deficit and [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=122.88s)]
*  also healthcare spending. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=123.64s)]
*  So the deficit hawks, and [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=125.32000000000001s)]
*  this is where, of course, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  I disagree with Thomas Massey, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=128.62s)]
*  considerably. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=130.52s)]
*  He wants to see deeper cuts in [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=131.72s)]
*  programs like the Medicaid program. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=133.6s)]
*  Okay, the far right members of [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=136.32s)]
*  the House Freedom Caucus want deeper [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=138.86s)]
*  cuts on social programs. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=141.78s)]
*  Now those cuts are highly unpopular, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=144.92s)]
*  cuts to Medicaid, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=147.52s)]
*  deeply unpopular. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=148.79999999999998s)]
*  Trump knows that. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=150.48s)]
*  So he has allegedly told Republicans [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=152.0s)]
*  don't eff around with Medicaid. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=155.4s)]
*  So look, Trump, I don't think Trump [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=159.68s)]
*  actually cares about Medicaid. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=161.35999999999999s)]
*  Trump cares about political [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=163.2s)]
*  popularity, and he doesn't want [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=164.76s)]
*  Republican voters in red states who [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=166.88s)]
*  might be on Medicaid to turn [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=169.28s)]
*  against him because his big, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=171.12s)]
*  beautiful bill cut funding for [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=173.06s)]
*  state Medicaid programs. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=175.28s)]
*  So there's the fiscal hawks, and [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=178.1s)]
*  then of course, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=179.5s)]
*  there are the moderate Democrats. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=180.1s)]
*  And the moderate Democrats, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=181.4s)]
*  A, don't want any Medicaid cut [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=182.94s)]
*  because of how unpopular it is, but [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=184.64000000000001s)]
*  they're also worried about [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=186.62s)]
*  the salt cap. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=188.34s)]
*  What's the salt cap? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=190.58s)]
*  Living in California, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=192.34s)]
*  I have a lot of experience with [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=193.34s)]
*  this. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=194.62s)]
*  So there are state and local taxes. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=195.3s)]
*  Prior to Trump's 2017 tax bill, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=197.62s)]
*  you could deduct an unlimited [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=200.38000000000002s)]
*  amount of state and local taxes [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=202.9s)]
*  that you've paid in your federal [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=205.82000000000002s)]
*  taxes. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=208.58s)]
*  So now that Donald Trump's 2017 [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=209.98000000000002s)]
*  tax bill caps the amount that you [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=213.38000000000002s)]
*  can deduct at $10,000, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=216.46s)]
*  a lot of people in blue states, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=218.9s)]
*  because blue states, of course, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=221.58s)]
*  are addicted to taxes. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=224.06s)]
*  They tax the hell out of us, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=226.22000000000003s)]
*  especially the sales taxes, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=227.70000000000002s)]
*  I should say. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=229.58s)]
*  They can't get enough anyway. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=230.22s)]
*  Since usually it's blue states that [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=232.98s)]
*  have higher state taxes and [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=235.58s)]
*  local taxes, those states are the [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=237.58s)]
*  ones that are really, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=240.06s)]
*  really hurt by that salt cap. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=241.74s)]
*  Now, there are Republican lawmakers [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=243.9s)]
*  who have won districts in blue [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=247.66s)]
*  states. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=250.54s)]
*  And they're like, yo, homie, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=251.66s)]
*  you gotta raise that $10,000 cap. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=253.94s)]
*  So believe it or not, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=256.7s)]
*  House Speaker Mike Johnson wanted [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=258.14s)]
*  to bring him over and say, look, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=260.78s)]
*  let's make a deal. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=263.34s)]
*  If you vote yes on this bill, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=264.62s)]
*  I will ensure that we will raise [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=266.53999999999996s)]
*  that salt cap from $10,000 to $40,000. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=268.85999999999996s)]
*  Is he not merciful? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=272.06s)]
*  Apparently that worked. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=275.46s)]
*  Apparently the moderate Republicans [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=276.41999999999996s)]
*  in the House are like, all right, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=278.38s)]
*  sold, we'll do it. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=280.26s)]
*  But the fiscal hawks [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=281.41999999999996s)]
*  ain't buying it. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=282.58s)]
*  And Trump is getting super salty [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=284.18s)]
*  about this. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=285.82s)]
*  So Trump has been meeting with [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=286.46s)]
*  the fiscal conservatives in [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=288.58s)]
*  the House Freedom Caucus and [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=290.58s)]
*  the Republican Party today. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=292.59999999999997s)]
*  He did so yesterday as well. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=294.97999999999996s)]
*  He's trying to kind of bully them [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=297.06s)]
*  into supporting his bill. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=299.02s)]
*  Now, as it stands right now, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=300.78s)]
*  according to the Congressional [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=302.7s)]
*  Budget Office, the current bill as [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=304.85999999999996s)]
*  it is sitting at the moment, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=307.46s)]
*  would increase our national debt to [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=309.5s)]
*  the tune of $2.3 trillion over [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=312.02s)]
*  the next 10 years. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=314.46000000000004s)]
*  So as you can tell, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=317.34000000000003s)]
*  the number keeps changing based on [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=318.90000000000003s)]
*  how the provisions are amended or [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=321.54s)]
*  changed. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=324.06s)]
*  So Trump met with the House Freedom [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=325.62s)]
*  Caucus today to handle the holdouts. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=327.54s)]
*  He says that failure to approve [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=329.86s)]
*  the bill will be the ultimate [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=331.90000000000003s)]
*  betrayal. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=333.74s)]
*  And the House Rules Committee [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=334.78000000000003s)]
*  worked through the night to [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=336.42s)]
*  essentially push the bill past [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=337.90000000000003s)]
*  a procedural test that would allow [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=339.54s)]
*  for a final vote on the House floor. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=341.42s)]
*  But lawmakers were still debating [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=344.02000000000004s)]
*  its provisions this afternoon. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=345.66s)]
*  They started the session at one in [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=347.58000000000004s)]
*  the morning, and by this afternoon [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=349.38s)]
*  they were still negotiating. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=351.34000000000003s)]
*  So obviously a lot of disagreement [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=353.22s)]
*  within the Republican caucus. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=355.22s)]
*  House Speaker Mike Johnson can only [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=357.3s)]
*  afford to lose two votes. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=359.26000000000005s)]
*  So there's obviously far more than [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=360.54s)]
*  two votes that are against [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=363.46000000000004s)]
*  the current bill, so [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=365.5s)]
*  that's why they keep negotiating [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=367.06s)]
*  this. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=369.38s)]
*  Now some refuse to sign on to [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=369.90000000000003s)]
*  the bill despite pressure, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=371.46000000000004s)]
*  including, well, House Freedom [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=373.38s)]
*  Caucus Chair Andy Harris, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=375.5s)]
*  who said the following in regard to [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=377.26s)]
*  Trump's bullying. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=379.5s)]
*  There's nothing the president could [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=381.34s)]
*  tell me tomorrow that would change [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=383.18s)]
*  my mind at this point. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=384.9s)]
*  I'm a hard no on it. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=385.94s)]
*  It increases the deficit. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=387.74s)]
*  We'll see, we'll see Mr. Harris. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=390.26s)]
*  Then you have Republicans from [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=392.74s)]
*  the moderate wing, who again, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=394.41999999999996s)]
*  do have issues with some of [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=396.14s)]
*  the proposed cuts to Medicaid. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=397.58s)]
*  Which might be the reason why Trump [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=400.02s)]
*  allegedly said this to Republicans, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=401.74s)]
*  don't F around with Medicaid. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=403.65999999999997s)]
*  Okay, so that was reported recently [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=405.38s)]
*  by Politico. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=407.5s)]
*  And that's also according to two [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=408.94s)]
*  Republicans granted anonymity to [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=410.53999999999996s)]
*  describe private meetings with [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=412.18s)]
*  the president. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=413.78s)]
*  He said that he was focused on [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=414.82s)]
*  saving, saving Medicaid by [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=416.74s)]
*  eliminating waste, fraud, and [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=418.62s)]
*  abuse, echoing comments he made to [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=420.7s)]
*  reporters outside the meeting. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=422.94s)]
*  So I worry about that because we've [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=425.46s)]
*  seen the Trump administration cut [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=427.78s)]
*  important funding to critical [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=430.34000000000003s)]
*  programs and argue that they [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=432.46s)]
*  didn't do anything wrong. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=434.5s)]
*  They were just cutting out the waste [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=436.38s)]
*  fraud and abuse. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=438.58s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=440.74s)]
*  I'm worried that there's going to [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=442.54s)]
*  be deeper cuts than we even know [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=444.22s)]
*  about and they're just going to [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=445.82s)]
*  reframe it as no, no, no, no, no. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=447.38s)]
*  This is just a cut on the waste. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=449.3s)]
*  But if they try to sell that to [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=452.66s)]
*  the American people, I don't think [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=453.98s)]
*  they're going to buy it if they [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=455.74s)]
*  have family members or if they [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=457.14s)]
*  themselves are noticing that their [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=458.66s)]
*  state Medicaid isn't covering the [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=460.82s)]
*  procedures they might need or [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=462.94s)]
*  certain benefits have been dropped [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=464.74s)]
*  from their state Medicaid program. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=466.9s)]
*  Or if they notice that they're not [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=469.22s)]
*  qualifying for it, if there are [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=471.34000000000003s)]
*  cuts and people are impacted by it, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=473.42s)]
*  and they're experiencing it in [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=475.7s)]
*  their lives, it doesn't matter how [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=477.9s)]
*  you frame it. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=480.34000000000003s)]
*  They're going to know what [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=481.46s)]
*  the truth is. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=482.34000000000003s)]
*  And look, I think Trump realizes [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=482.9s)]
*  that, which is why so far he's been [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=484.62s)]
*  hands off with Social Security and [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=486.54s)]
*  Medicare. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=488.5s)]
*  But I think if anyone is under [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=490.3s)]
*  the impression that Medicaid is [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=492.34000000000003s)]
*  less popular, they'd be mistaken. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=494.78000000000003s)]
*  So we'll see what the Republicans [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=497.86s)]
*  end up doing about this. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=499.7s)]
*  But just to reiterate, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=501.18s)]
*  some Republicans who are against [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=502.78000000000003s)]
*  this bill remain undeterred from [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=505.02000000000004s)]
*  voting no. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=507.38s)]
*  Massey said he's unbothered by [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=508.82s)]
*  Trump's bullying and that he's [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=510.70000000000005s)]
*  still a no on the legislation. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=512.7s)]
*  Massey also said this of Trump, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=514.38s)]
*  I don't think he wants to talk [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=517.1s)]
*  about cutting spending. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=518.7s)]
*  Massey said of the president's [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=520.1800000000001s)]
*  presentation to the House [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=521.74s)]
*  Republican Conference. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=523.0600000000001s)]
*  He just said go after waste, fraud [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=524.38s)]
*  and abuse. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=526.7s)]
*  It means quit talking about it, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=527.86s)]
*  Freedom Caucus. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=529.98s)]
*  Trump probably wouldn't take off [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=531.6600000000001s)]
*  one beneficiary who's not an illegal [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=533.6600000000001s)]
*  alien or felon. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=535.86s)]
*  I mean, but why would he? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=537.9000000000001s)]
*  Why would he want to take Americans? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=539.0600000000001s)]
*  Why would he want to rip Medicaid [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=541.5400000000001s)]
*  away from Americans who need it? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=543.3000000000001s)]
*  See, this is where obviously I [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=545.8599999999999s)]
*  disagree with Massey. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=547.3399999999999s)]
*  But he's showing that he's [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=548.54s)]
*  principled because I'm sure he's [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=549.9799999999999s)]
*  catching a lot of heat from Trump [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=551.8199999999999s)]
*  on this. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=553.54s)]
*  Nonetheless, he says, I don't think [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=554.78s)]
*  he cares about the work [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=556.6999999999999s)]
*  requirements, if he did, they would [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=557.9399999999999s)]
*  be real and they would kick in now. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=560.02s)]
*  So what he's referring to is [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=562.38s)]
*  the fact that the work requirements [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=564.3s)]
*  for Medicaid would not come into [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=567.02s)]
*  effect even during Trump's term. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=569.5s)]
*  And so that might be on purpose to [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=573.3s)]
*  ensure that Trump doesn't face [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=575.22s)]
*  the political consequences of [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=577.02s)]
*  cutting Medicaid or the work [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=578.8000000000001s)]
*  requirements associated with [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=580.46s)]
*  Medicaid. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=582.26s)]
*  And Massey has a problem with that. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=582.82s)]
*  So again, lots of disagreement, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=584.1800000000001s)]
*  lots of fighting. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=586.0600000000001s)]
*  But this is how it works, guys. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=587.34s)]
*  This is how politics works. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=588.78s)]
*  Not everyone agrees on everything, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=590.22s)]
*  especially within the same party. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=592.3000000000001s)]
*  So they're hashing it out to come [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=594.58s)]
*  out with the right conclusion. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=596.46s)]
*  And it's good that there are [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=599.02s)]
*  moderate Republicans involved. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=600.3000000000001s)]
*  So the House Freedom Caucus and [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=601.82s)]
*  the far right wing of the [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=603.46s)]
*  Republican Party doesn't get to [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=604.62s)]
*  monopolize what this bill ends up [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=606.62s)]
*  being. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=608.78s)]
*  So for now, we don't know what [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=609.86s)]
*  the final bill is going to look [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=611.46s)]
*  like. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=613.02s)]
*  But once we do, of course, we're [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=613.86s)]
*  going to give you guys the details. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=615.26s)]
*  They're hoping to pass this bill [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=616.42s)]
*  before Memorial Day. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=618.14s)]
*  We'll see if they manage to do it. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=619.98s)]
*  But remember, they've got some [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=621.5s)]
*  obstacles in the Senate as well. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=623.02s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=625.1s)]
*  an angel gets his wings. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=626.74s)]
*  Totally not true, but [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=628.18s)]
*  it does keep you updated on [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=629.22s)]
*  our live shows. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmusGeZpGQQ&t=630.5s)]
