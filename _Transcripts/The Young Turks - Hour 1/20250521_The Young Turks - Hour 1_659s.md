TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

# Rubio Gets GRILLED for Abducting Pro-Palestinian Student Over Op-Ed
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [May 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs)
*  She wrote an op-ed. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=0.0s)]
*  She wrote an op-ed and I'm talking to you about her particular case. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=1.28s)]
*  You reclaim, you reclaiming my time, you revoked her student visa because she wrote an op-ed. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=4.8s)]
*  Would you revoke- [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=11.84s)]
*  We're gonna do more of them. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=12.4s)]
*  Today, Secretary of State Marco Rubio testified before the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=15.44s)]
*  And as you just heard from that clip, progressive congressman Pramila Jayapal [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=21.6s)]
*  grilled him on the arrests of students who are here in the United States with student visas. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=25.84s)]
*  These are individuals who end up getting their visas revoked because of the fact that they were [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=31.520000000000003s)]
*  either part of some of the pro-Israel boycott protests on college campuses. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=37.120000000000005s)]
*  Or because they simply wrote an op-ed in their student newspaper that called for the [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=43.84s)]
*  boycott of Israel as long as this brutal war on Gaza continues. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=49.92s)]
*  And so the person that she was asking about specifically there, of course, was Turkish [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=55.68s)]
*  national Rumyessa Ozturk, who we had shown you all a video of getting arrested in broad daylight by [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=60.32s)]
*  masked federal agents because she wrote an op-ed calling for Tufts University to divest from [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=68.0s)]
*  Israeli companies as a result of this war that has killed tens of thousands of innocent civilians [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=75.92s)]
*  in Gaza. And so the clip we showed you was midway through an extended battle between [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=82.32000000000001s)]
*  Jayapal and Rubio. I wanna show you how it went down in the very beginning, so take a look. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=88.4s)]
*  The State Department approved the revocation of a student visa for Rumyessa Ozturk, a Turkish citizen [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  who is a graduate student at Tufts University, apparently simply for writing an op-ed. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=101.36s)]
*  Where in the Constitution does it say that the Secretary of State can override the First Amendment [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=107.6s)]
*  protections of free speech? Is there a footnote that I missed somewhere? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=116.0s)]
*  There's no constitutional right to a student visa. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=118.88s)]
*  So, but is there a constitutional right? Does it say somewhere that Marco Rubio gets to determine [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=121.03999999999999s)]
*  which speech is appropriate and revokes student visas based on [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=127.60000000000001s)]
*  what you think constitutes free speech? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=131.6s)]
*  There's a statute that says the Secretary of State gets to determine whether someone is a threat. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=133.36s)]
*  We deny visas every day all over the world. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=137.6s)]
*  Do you think that the INA- [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=139.12s)]
*  So what you can hear Pramila Jayapal getting at in her line of questioning is, hey, listen, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=142.0s)]
*  this is an issue of a student who is here on a student visa. She is constitutionally protected [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=148.8s)]
*  by the First Amendment to share her opinion on these issues. And that is true. There is precedent [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=156.48s)]
*  on this. The Supreme Court in the past has ruled on this. For people who are in this country, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=163.12s)]
*  whether they're citizens or non-citizens, they are protected by the same rights, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=168.72s)]
*  including the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=172.88s)]
*  Now, Marco Rubio continues regurgitating the same talking point over and over again. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=176.39999999999998s)]
*  Well, Secretary of State holds the right to blah, blah, blah. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=180.64s)]
*  Okay, but what I wanna focus on here is the fact that she was specifically targeted, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=183.76000000000002s)]
*  Ostrich was specifically targeted because she co-wrote what I feel is a pretty milktoast op-ed [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=189.60000000000002s)]
*  for the Tufts University student paper. And all she did by co-authoring it is co-sign on the idea [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=198.16s)]
*  that the university should divest from Israeli companies because of the genocide that currently [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=206.24s)]
*  is taking place in the Gaza Strip. And for that reason, because of the fact that that type of op-ed [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=212.08s)]
*  offends a foreign government, the government of Israel, we have the United States government [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=217.76000000000002s)]
*  rounding up students who are here on visa for sharing their opinion. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=225.60000000000002s)]
*  It's insane. So there was more, okay? Jayapal asked Rubio why it was necessary for [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=230.56s)]
*  masked officers to do this, and here's what he had to say. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=236.08s)]
*  Why did the administration need to use masked, armed, unidentified agents to whisk somebody off [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=240.08s)]
*  the street and deny her counsel for almost 24 hours after her arrest? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=246.0s)]
*  Well, you'll have to ask the agencies that did that work. I'm not responsible for [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=250.0s)]
*  revoking the visas of these people that come to tear this country apart. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=253.84s)]
*  Secretary Rubio, I'm talking about this particular case where you revoke the student visa of a Turkish [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=256.72s)]
*  citizen who was a graduate student who wrote an op-ed that you didn't like. And suddenly you [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=264.24s)]
*  allowed for masked men to whisk her off the street. And you have multiple jobs, apparently. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=268.32s)]
*  You're the national security advisor as well. So don't tell me it's not your job [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=273.04s)]
*  who snatches her off the street. If these are legitimate- [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=276.88s)]
*  We don't do the snatching, but I can tell you we do the visa revocations, and we're gonna keep [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=279.68s)]
*  doing them. Let me ask you about the national security consequences of masked [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=282.0s)]
*  men on the streets, snatching people off the streets. If these are legitimate law enforcement [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=286.24s)]
*  agents carrying out proper arrests, why are they hiding their identities? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=291.76s)]
*  Because then radical crazies will try to hurt them. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=295.36s)]
*  Yeah, look, Jayapal didn't buy that argument. I don't buy that argument at all. Now Marco Rubio [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=298.24s)]
*  arguing that he has the right to do this as it pertains to individuals who are in the country [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=306.8s)]
*  and pose a threat to national security. You need to show how [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=313.36s)]
*  Ostchirk is threatening American national security when she co-authors a milk toast op-ed [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=317.28000000000003s)]
*  for Tufts University. How exactly is that a threat to our national security? It's not, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=325.04s)]
*  obviously it's not. Look, we all know what's going on here. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=330.96000000000004s)]
*  Everyone who's actually honest and looks at the details of this story knows what's going on here. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=334.48s)]
*  You have pro-Israel groups, nonprofits here in the US. We don't know where they're getting [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=341.68s)]
*  their funding from. Let's just keep it real. They're putting together lists of people [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=347.36s)]
*  that Israel's offended by because they're sharing their criticisms of Israel. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=353.52000000000004s)]
*  They go to the Trump administration. These are the people we want you to deport. These are the [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=358.48s)]
*  people we want you to arrest. And embarrassingly, the Trump administration is carrying it out, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=361.68s)]
*  carrying out the dirty deeds of a foreign government. And that's my problem with this. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=368.16s)]
*  Okay, that's my problem with this. Because take the political messaging out of it entirely. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=372.64s)]
*  Obviously, I'm very critical of Israel for obvious reasons. We talk about it on this show every day. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=378.15999999999997s)]
*  But let's just take the politics out of it entirely and focus on, I guess, the act [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=384.0s)]
*  of the United States government arresting, deporting individuals who are here [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=392.0s)]
*  based on the desires and demands of a foreign government. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=399.68s)]
*  That's what I have the big issue with. Let's say you have, I don't know, a Turkish national [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=403.59999999999997s)]
*  who's here on a student visa and they engage in some sort of protest against the acknowledgement [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=409.84s)]
*  of the Armenian genocide. Now, I would find that deeply disgusting and offensive, I would. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=417.12s)]
*  But the idea that I would sit on this show or sit in this chair on this show and cheerlead [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=423.91999999999996s)]
*  Armenia succeeding in convincing the American government to deport that student is laughable [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=431.03999999999996s)]
*  to me. I would never do that. I would never defend that. Because guess what? In this country, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=436.47999999999996s)]
*  we're Americans and we should be represented by an American government that seeks to serve us. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=441.44s)]
*  An American government that seeks to do what's right for Americans and people within the borders [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=448.47999999999996s)]
*  of this country. But right now, we seem to have a government that is far too influenced [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=453.44s)]
*  by a foreign government. So much so that they'll target innocent people who haven't done anything [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=460.64s)]
*  wrong. It's totally disgusting and I wanna jump ahead here because Marco Rubio is Cuban, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=466.71999999999997s)]
*  Cuban American. I have a little bit of experience with Cuban Americans, my husband's Cuban. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=474.96s)]
*  And Cuban Americans, especially, have very strong feelings about the current communist [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=480.08s)]
*  government in Cuba. Marco Rubio happens to be one of the critics. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=486.24s)]
*  And I want you to take a good hard look at what he purports to be one of his biggest values [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=490.0s)]
*  when he's talking about Cuba, when he's talking about freedom of speech in a context that's [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=496.0s)]
*  convenient for him. Take a look. The average person on the street cannot go on the internet [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=501.52s)]
*  in Cuba. It's not just a capacity issue, it is prohibited. In fact, I'm gonna send out a tweet [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=506.64s)]
*  right now. If I sent this tweet in Cuba, I would be put in jail, okay? And I'm gonna send it right [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=511.12s)]
*  now as an example of what people in Cuba cannot do. You're gathered today for a cause that's much [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-2zM-8RYs&t=516.4s)]
