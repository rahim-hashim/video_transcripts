# Report Reveals Why Luigi Mangione Is So Popular
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [March 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI)
*  Celebrating anybody's murder is wrong. Understanding why the celebration is happening [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=0.0s)]
*  is also really important. The American people are angry, and rightfully so. They feel the system [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=8.88s)]
*  is rigged against them. That's why they elected Donald Trump, and that's why an assassin is now [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=14.0s)]
*  treated like Robin Hood. That was actually great commentary. There are a lot of things that that [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=19.28s)]
*  host from NewsNation says that I disagree with, but that was correct. Celebrating murder is wrong. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=27.36s)]
*  However, it is important to understand why people are celebrating the murder of United [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=33.12s)]
*  healthcare CEO, Brian Thompson. Now, Luigi Mangione, of course, is the individual who [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=38.879999999999995s)]
*  allegedly carried out that murder. But one week after that killing happened, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=44.239999999999995s)]
*  a report compiled by the Connecticut Intelligence Center admitted that rising healthcare costs [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=50.4s)]
*  are in fact correlated to threats against executives and could potentially lead to [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=57.44s)]
*  civil unrest. In fact, they consider this a possible national security threat. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  So as the American prospect explains, this regional intelligence outfit is one of the dozens of [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=68.88s)]
*  similar centers across the country that communicate intel between federal agencies and state law [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=75.76s)]
*  enforcement. They write that healthcare expenditure in the United States increased [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=81.2s)]
*  from $2.75 trillion in 2004 to $4.09 trillion in 2018 in inflation-adjusted dollars. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=85.92s)]
*  2019 and 2020 saw expenditures of $4.2 trillion and $4.6 trillion, respectively, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=97.36s)]
*  which represents a 10.6% increase year over year and was largely influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=105.76s)]
*  So I don't know if everyone in the audience understands what I'm about to describe, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=114.39999999999999s)]
*  but I know I felt it. I know a lot of Americans feel it. And it's just this [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=121.92s)]
*  sense that you're constantly being squeezed. It's like being in a room where the walls are [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=126.88s)]
*  slowly starting to come in on you, right? And it just gets harder and harder to deal with [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=131.51999999999998s)]
*  the simple things that should be easy in life. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=138.48s)]
*  Access to affordable healthcare is definitely part of that frustration. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=141.84s)]
*  Working 12, 16 hours a day, taking on two, three jobs to make ends meet and still being unable to [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=146.48s)]
*  afford housing. All of these things, I believe, has led to the anger, the rage, everything we're [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=152.48s)]
*  seeing among the American electorate right now. And it created the perfect environment for someone [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=159.76s)]
*  like Donald Trump, who purported to be this populist, to come in and sweep away all of these [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=164.88s)]
*  voters who were just desperate for anyone to even acknowledge that these issues existed. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=173.76s)]
*  Now, the way he is carrying out his term makes it clear that a lot of what he purported to care [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=179.44s)]
*  about isn't really what he cared about at all, does not really intend to do it. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=184.24s)]
*  He's focused all of his energy on cutting services. And I think that has a lot to do [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=187.51999999999998s)]
*  with the fact that the tech bros have essentially co-opted the MAGA movement and the more [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=192.16s)]
*  economically populist MAGA types. I gotta be honest with you guys, seems like you guys are [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=198.4s)]
*  on the back burner for the Trump administration. But don't worry, the wealthy will get their $4.5 [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=203.2s)]
*  trillion in taxes very, very soon. And I'm sure that'll trickle all over you. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=207.84s)]
*  So just like it did last time, right? Now, the Connecticut Intelligence Center also writes that [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=212.56s)]
*  historically threats of actual acts of violence against those in the healthcare industry [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=220.32s)]
*  rose by more than 60% from 2011 to 2018. So they cite not only high healthcare costs, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=225.44s)]
*  but also wealth inequality as a continuing factor that really jeopardizes or threatens [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=232.95999999999998s)]
*  national security, creates national security vulnerabilities. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=239.68s)]
*  Overall, trust in the US healthcare system is at a historic low, only marginally higher than the [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=243.2s)]
*  all time low in 2007, while levels of income inequality have reached historic highs. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=250.08s)]
*  A financial study reveals among the leading contributors to low trust were concerns about [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=256.40000000000003s)]
*  financial motives, quality of care, influence of other entities or agendas, and perception [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=262.96000000000004s)]
*  of discrimination or bias. Let's just talk briefly about influence of other entities or agendas. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=270.8s)]
*  Could private equity firms be part of that? The fact that you have private investors buying up [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=278.47999999999996s)]
*  hospitals now, consolidating said hospitals because why would investors invest in anything? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=285.28s)]
*  They wanna return on their investment. How do you maximize profits? You cut services, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=292.71999999999997s)]
*  you fire nurses, workers, all sorts of important staff in the hospital in order to minimize your [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=297.35999999999996s)]
*  costs, maximize your profits. So even if you're a fortunate American who has [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=303.84s)]
*  decent insurance that doesn't deny every single claim you make, well, you're still gonna have to [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=311.11999999999995s)]
*  deal with a hospital system in the United States now that is being chipped away at by private equity [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=318.56s)]
*  firms who are seeking to use these facilities as a money making opportunity. So I can totally [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=325.52s)]
*  understand why these bullet points are being mentioned in this report. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=331.92s)]
*  And they go on to say that in 2021, New York had a 10 year high 488 homicides. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=336.08000000000004s)]
*  I don't know, did they? I think that might be made up. I don't know if that's true. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=345.36s)]
*  It's weird. Anyway, I'll continue. In 2021, New York had a 10 year high 488 homicides while the [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=350.40000000000003s)]
*  New York City Police Department cleared only 56% according to their own data. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=357.76s)]
*  The general public may view the ensuing manhunt and subsequent arrest of Mangione as NYPD and [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=363.2s)]
*  largely policing as a whole as a tool that is willing to expend massive resources to [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=371.36s)]
*  protect the wealthy while the average citizen is left to their own means for personal security. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=378.8s)]
*  Man, I gotta be honest, that one hit really deep because it's true. Because it's true, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=385.36s)]
*  there was a nationwide manhunt for Luigi Mangione. It wasn't just the NYPD. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=392.40000000000003s)]
*  When a healthcare executive is murdered, obviously that should be investigated. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=398.72s)]
*  I'm not saying that the police shouldn't have taken that seriously. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=402.8s)]
*  But really the NYPD has a 56% clearance rate when it came to the homicides that were committed in [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=406.32s)]
*  2021. That's a bit of an issue, isn't it? It kind of reminds me of when all of these [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=413.2s)]
*  follow home robberies were happening in Los Angeles, meaning people would go out with [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=420.4s)]
*  their friends or significant other and enjoy a nice dinner. And then these robbers would [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=424.47999999999996s)]
*  literally follow them home and then rob them the second they turn the key to enter their home. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=429.52s)]
*  A lot of those cases were unsolved. None of those people got caught. Maybe some of them got caught, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=436.48s)]
*  but most of them did not. Something similar happened to Mayor Karen Bass. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=441.04s)]
*  They caught the robber real quick, real quick. Okay, they're not gonna hesitate. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=447.44s)]
*  Now imagine living in a world where that kind of policing happens [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=453.36s)]
*  for everybody, not just powerful people or rich people. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=457.68s)]
*  Finally, the dossier makes the shocking admission that many of you Thompson as a symbolic [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=460.72s)]
*  representation of both as reports of insurance companies denying life sustaining medication [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=465.2s)]
*  coverage circulate online. It is not an unfair comparison to equate the current reaction toward [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=473.12s)]
*  Mangione to the reactions to Robin Hood. Citizens may see Mangione's alleged actions as an attack [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=479.68s)]
*  against a system designed to work against them. And look, that's exactly why Mangione got the [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=487.91999999999996s)]
*  positive reaction he did despite the fact that he did kill someone in cold blood, allegedly. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=494.64s)]
*  I wanna be very careful in case something crazy happens and they have mistaken identity. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=500.96s)]
*  But honestly, I mean, everyone seems to accept that he's likely the murderer here. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=507.12s)]
*  Now, while business elites and media pundits gaslight Americans into thinking that they're [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=512.08s)]
*  just too whiny about how screwed up the healthcare system in America really is, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=517.1999999999999s)]
*  even the intelligence community acknowledges that the system is in fact breeding resentment, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=522.1600000000001s)]
*  anger, and this destabilizes a society. I think that's what we're starting to see. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=528.48s)]
*  And it's about to get even worse thanks to Donald Trump and his pick to run these centers for [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=534.72s)]
*  Medicare and Medicaid. That person is Dr. Oz, and I wanna talk a little bit about what he is [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=540.32s)]
*  planning to do. So according to a new report by DropSite News, Dr. Oz, who was tapped by [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=546.0s)]
*  Donald Trump to serve as the head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=553.84s)]
*  he might be looking to privatize the entirety of our Medicare system. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=562.32s)]
*  And look, it's already partly privatized, unfortunately, and that has led to American [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=566.48s)]
*  taxpayers getting price gouged by these private insurers who run Medicare Advantage. But Dr. Oz [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=573.28s)]
*  loves it, and he might actually do that to the entirety of the program. So Medicare Advantage, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=580.88s)]
*  just so we're all up to date on what that is, it's basically publicly funded through Medicare [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=586.4s)]
*  dollars, but it's privately run through private insurers like UnitedHealthcare. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=592.4s)]
*  And so as a UnitedHealth shareholder and licensed insurance broker, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=598.4s)]
*  Oz has long been financially and ideologically committed to the takeover of traditional Medicare [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=604.24s)]
*  by private insurers. So private insurers already receive more than half of Medicare's $840 billion [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=610.5600000000001s)]
*  budget. So that's what I'm referring to when I say that Medicare is already partly privatized. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=618.96s)]
*  But that's been a disaster. And now with the help of Trump and Dr. Oz, they're plotting to basically [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=624.4799999999999s)]
*  take the rest in a system that Oz calls Medicare Advantage for All, right? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=630.16s)]
*  He's like, Medicare for All is really popular. Let me piggyback off that messaging and [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=637.1999999999999s)]
*  just add another word. Hopefully that'll trick people into supporting it, Medicare Advantage for [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=642.4s)]
*  All. But make no mistake, Medicare Advantage is the privately run part of Medicare that has, again, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=647.12s)]
*  been full of fraud, full of waste and abuse. There hasn't been a lot of attention paid to [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=654.48s)]
*  Medicare Advantage, interestingly enough, but nonetheless. So how would this work? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=660.16s)]
*  According to DropSight, there are two ways Republicans could carry out this assault on [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=663.92s)]
*  traditional Medicare. The first and more difficult way would involve an act of Congress that basically [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=668.8s)]
*  transfers current Medicare enrollees into Medicare Advantage plan. So taking them off the public [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=674.88s)]
*  system, transferring them over to the privately run system. The second method involves what's [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=681.2s)]
*  known as the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation, or CMMI. So it's a policy hub with [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=688.16s)]
*  the power to essentially implement pilot projects to test different payment and delivery methods. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=695.76s)]
*  And if these pilots are determined successful, defined as reducing costs without impacting quality [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=702.32s)]
*  or improving quality without increasing costs, then CMS can ramp them up nationwide without [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=708.0s)]
*  congressional oversight. But here's the thing, the Trump administration can just lie, right? [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=714.8000000000001s)]
*  They can just pretend that, no, no, no, Medicare Advantage is actually saving money. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=722.32s)]
*  But we have a mountain of evidence to show that that's not the case. Medicare Advantage, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=728.24s)]
*  because it is run by private companies seeking to maximize their profits, have abused the system, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=733.52s)]
*  have even turned in claims to be authorized for services that were never even rendered. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=739.4399999999999s)]
*  Okay, that's the kind of fraud that has been going on with Medicare Advantage plans. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=747.28s)]
*  And so a source on the Hill and another with CMMI actually confirmed to DropSight [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=752.4s)]
*  that multiple pilots are being prepared to push Medicare Advantage enrollment [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=758.88s)]
*  at the expense of traditional Medicare. As called for, by the way, in Project 2025, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=764.56s)]
*  the first would make Medicare Advantage the default enrollment for newly eligible seniors. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=770.24s)]
*  Okay, so understand that. Right now, if you enroll for Medicare, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=777.28s)]
*  you're not automatically enrolled to Medicare Advantage. You would have to do that yourself. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=780.64s)]
*  So in this case, no, the default would be you're enrolled in the private version of Medicare. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=786.08s)]
*  So the second approach would move an as yet unknown percentage of those currently in traditional [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=792.96s)]
*  Medicare into a Medicare Advantage plan. The third would automatically assign all existing [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=802.24s)]
*  Medicare enrollees within certain counties to something very similar to a Medicare Advantage [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=808.08s)]
*  plan. All Oz, again, would have to do is basically deem these pilots as super successful. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=814.4000000000001s)]
*  They're saving the government money. Ed Weisbart, who is the National Secretary of the Physicians [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=820.5600000000001s)]
*  for a National Health Program, argues they're likely to ignore comparative data from the last [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=827.12s)]
*  20 years because all of that data shows Medicare Advantage and similar programs [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=833.84s)]
*  drive up the cost of healthcare while harming millions of Americans. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=839.12s)]
*  Instead, they'll fabricate their own measurements of success and use these pilots to turn our beloved [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=844.0s)]
*  Medicare program over to the investment community indifferent to the untold harm it would cause. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=850.48s)]
*  And by the way, I mean, privately run again, just you have to emphasize it's about [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=858.72s)]
*  making a profit. It's about returning profit to your investors. It's not about the best care. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=865.6800000000001s)]
*  It's not about obviously affordable care. It's not about that. And by the way, he's right that [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=871.2800000000001s)]
*  Medicare is beloved according to KFF. 92% of beneficiaries 65 years or older rate Medicare's [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=877.52s)]
*  performance positively. Not only would Americans get screwed out of the best thing the federal [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=885.44s)]
*  government provides for them if Dr. Oz gets his way, it would also cost a crap ton of money. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=890.96s)]
*  According to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, the program's watchdog agency. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=897.84s)]
*  Wow, I thought Doge was the only watchdog agency in town, but this is the actual watchdog agency [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=903.0400000000001s)]
*  that actually wants to cut out waste, fraud and abuse. Medicare Advantage plans cost taxpayers [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=908.48s)]
*  22% more than traditional Medicare amounting to a projected $83 billion in 2024. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=913.36s)]
*  So just let that sink in. American taxpayers are already getting price gouged by pharmaceutical [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=922.16s)]
*  companies because Medicare isn't allowed to negotiate drug prices. I mean, how is that [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=928.24s)]
*  in any way a pro capitalist way of doing things? You're not allowed to negotiate for lower drug [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=934.4s)]
*  prices, that's insane. So you're just gonna have to sit back as the American taxpayer and literally [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=939.68s)]
*  allow these drug companies to name their price. No negotiation, Medicare is gonna pay for it. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=944.88s)]
*  So they're getting price gouged in that way. And now, if all of this comes to fruition, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=952.4s)]
*  and the whole system is privatized, Medicare is gonna cost more and it's gonna provide [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=958.0s)]
*  less in terms of healthcare for our elders. And this is happening with that backdrop of [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=964.56s)]
*  Medicaid potentially getting cut as a result of the House blueprint for the upcoming budget bill. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=971.28s)]
*  In that budget bill, the committee who is responsible for overseeing Medicaid and [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=979.5999999999999s)]
*  SNAP benefits, they've been ordered to find some cuts, $880 billion in cuts. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=986.0799999999999s)]
*  Where do you think those cuts are gonna come from, guys? Where do you think [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=995.36s)]
*  the bulk of our spending is outside of defense? Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=998.64s)]
*  the things that are actually worth paying taxes for. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=1005.28s)]
*  So we're not having a conversation about cutting the fat in the Pentagon. We're not having a [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=1008.32s)]
*  conversation about lowering drug prices by allowing Medicare to negotiate all drug prices, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=1018.08s)]
*  not just a handful of them because of a weak bill that was passed during the Biden administration. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=1024.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I'm calling it weak. Really, 10 drugs? Okay. I mean, the system is totally scamming us, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=1029.04s)]
*  totally ripping us off. And it's all happening with the help of whoever's in charge at any given [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=1037.04s)]
*  time. Doesn't matter if it's a Democrat or Republican. This is what corporate rule looks like. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=1044.08s)]
*  You pay a lot more for a crappy product [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=1049.6s)]
*  just so a handful of people can make more money. It's gross. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MrGdClejuI&t=1053.44s)]
