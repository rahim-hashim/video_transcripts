TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.

# REPORT: Israeli Gov't Planning UNBELIEVABLE Next Step
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [March 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y)
*  You can't live in Gaza right now and I think we need another location. I think it should [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=0.0s)]
*  be a location that's gonna make people happy. If we can get a beautiful area to resettle [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=4.7s)]
*  people permanently in nice homes and where they can be happy and not be shot, not be [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=9.28s)]
*  killed, not be knifed to death like what's happening in Gaza. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=14.58s)]
*  I don't think people should be going back to Gaza. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=18.12s)]
*  Would Palestinians have the right to return to Gaza if they left while the rebellion was [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=20.2s)]
*  happening? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=25.16s)]
*  I hope that we could do something really nice, really good where they wouldn't wanna return. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=26.16s)]
*  How many people are you thinking about? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=30.64s)]
*  All of them. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=33.76s)]
*  Okay, so if you push past the buffoonish clownish way that he talks, that's just an absolutely [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=34.76s)]
*  massive war crime against humanity that he's describing there. I mean, that is casually [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=41.32s)]
*  discussing genocide in a way that I don't know we've ever seen before as he sits there [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=47.32s)]
*  next to the guy responsible for the shooting and all of that that he thinks these people [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=54.0s)]
*  need to flee as he plans for an entire population to be taken against their will, their land [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=58.12s)]
*  utterly stolen, never to be returned and then for them to be dumped somewhere. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=64.88s)]
*  That was back in February and lest you believe that he was just being Trump, he was being [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=69.32s)]
*  silly, he wouldn't actually push for that. It's not really gonna happen. Well, it's happening [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=74.88s)]
*  because Axios reports that Benjamin and Yahoo was in that video has tasked Assad with finding [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=79.82000000000001s)]
*  countries that would take in a huge volume of Palestinian refugees. Apparently, they [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=85.26s)]
*  have already spoken with Somalia and South Sudan, which I'm sure if you were to ask Trump [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=90.06s)]
*  these nice places with nice houses to make a list of countries, those are the first two [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=95.18s)]
*  that he would put on that list. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=99.3s)]
*  Also Indonesia, and that's what they said. So where are they gonna put the entire Palestinian [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=101.62s)]
*  population? Well, Africa, Southeast Asia, wherever the moon and incinerator, just get [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=107.24000000000001s)]
*  them the hell out of there. That's what the plan appears to be. And I haven't yet seen [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=114.24000000000001s)]
*  any reporting of any country saying that they would be willing to take in the better part [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=119.64s)]
*  of a million men, women and children. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=123.62s)]
*  Cenk, but do you have any ideas of whether they might get any takers? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=125.88s)]
*  Yeah, I'm super worried. I've heard rumors of another country as well, which I'll talk [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=128.84s)]
*  about in a little bit later in this segment. And then look, I wanna talk about their overall [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=133.88s)]
*  plan and how it's been their plan from day one. And at the end, I wanna talk about is [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=142.2s)]
*  there any hope for stopping this? It's a slim, slim hope, but I wanna talk about who can [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=147.08s)]
*  possibly stop it. But John, tell us more about it. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=152.16s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know that I even have that hope, but I would speculate that if it were, I don't [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=156.08s)]
*  know, Saddam Hussein a couple decades ago that was saying, hey, in like a year, I'm [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=161.51999999999998s)]
*  gonna round up a million people and I'm gonna force them off their land. The UN would probably [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=166.56s)]
*  get involved. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=171.12s)]
*  I imagine when Putin wants to forcefully relocate people, we've armed the resistance to that. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=172.12s)]
*  Other countries have too. Is there a reason that this sort of planned, projected genocide [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=179.16s)]
*  is acceptable because it's Israel? That's not a rhetorical question, by the way. I am [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=186.16s)]
*  waiting to see the world actually do something to stop this, but thus far they're not. And [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=190.88s)]
*  so that's what Mossad is doing. Other parts of the Israeli government are working on different [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=196.0s)]
*  components of this genocide. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=199.92000000000002s)]
*  So Israel's cabinet approved the formation of a special directorate in the Ministry of [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=202.16s)]
*  Defense that will oversee the, and it's important that you know these are in quotation marks, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=206.34s)]
*  willful departure of Palestinians from Gaza. All of them will be willful. They're all fine [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=211.76s)]
*  with their land being stolen from them and then being dumped in some slum that they've, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=218.84s)]
*  they don't know anything about the place, anything about the language, whatever, that'll [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=224.16s)]
*  be it for them. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=227.04s)]
*  By the way, the finance minister last month spoke to the parliament and said, if we take [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=228.76s)]
*  out 10,000 a day, it will take six months. If we take out 5,000 a day, it will take a [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=234.45999999999998s)]
*  year, which is obviously horrifying. It's a bit vague. We don't know, are they gonna [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=241.35999999999999s)]
*  march the 10,000 a day along some sort of trail as they steal their land and move them [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=245.56s)]
*  somewhere? Maybe they'll load the 10,000 a day onto trains or something and ship them [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=250.92000000000002s)]
*  off. I don't know. It's a lot of people. They're gonna have to figure out how you do this sort [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=255.48000000000002s)]
*  of industrial relocation. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=259.88s)]
*  But apparently they are working for it in multiple aspects of their government. So that's [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=261.78000000000003s)]
*  currently what we know. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=266.28000000000003s)]
*  One of our members on tyt.com, Spider-Man Dragon, said a point that I was about to make. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=267.78000000000003s)]
*  I'm surprised Trump isn't saying deport the Palestinians to El Salvador, but that means [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=273.56s)]
*  they'd be closer to our border. Yeah, I mean, it's possible that at the end they're just [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=278.0s)]
*  like, who wants them? We're gonna pay you, right? Why did El Salvador take the Venezuelans [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=282.59999999999997s)]
*  that we sent over there? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=291.0s)]
*  We gave them $6 million. So if Israel or America, and by the way, Israel's not gonna give them [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=292.0s)]
*  any money, they're gonna make America give them money to relocate the Palestinians, right? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=296.24s)]
*  So if they go to a super poor country that might be in the middle of a civil war and [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=302.0s)]
*  go, hey, we'll pay, by the way, not the country, but whoever the dictator or whoever's running [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=305.4s)]
*  the country, some giant amount of money, doesn't matter, it's gonna come from American taxpayers [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=310.2s)]
*  anyway, to take in all these people. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=314.52s)]
*  Put them in a prison, put them in camps, put them in tents, who cares? The whole point is [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=316.28s)]
*  ethnic cleansing and genocide anyway. And by the way, if you don't think removing over [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=320.16s)]
*  2 million people from their homes and driving them to another country is ethnic cleansing, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=324.72s)]
*  you literally don't understand the meaning of words. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=329.96s)]
*  You don't speak the English language. That is the textbook definition of ethnic cleansing. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=333.35999999999996s)]
*  So Trump blithely likes, maybe we should move them out. And then they're out there. And [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=337.76s)]
*  who, no, you're driving them from their land. You're joking around about a war crime, but [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=343.15999999999997s)]
*  whatever. I get it, Trump's an idiot, doesn't know anything, doesn't care. He's just like, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=347.64s)]
*  me want Adelson money, yeah, right? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=352.88s)]
*  I get it, I get it, he's super low brow. And look, some of his followers hate what he's [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=355.56s)]
*  doing. A lot of his followers are like, yeah, Trump said it, then I'm okay, forget freedom, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=360.44s)]
*  forget anything, forget America first, we now serve Israel, etc, etc. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=365.4s)]
*  And so in terms of other rumors I've heard, I've heard that Turkey might consider him. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=370.12s)]
*  These are epic disasters. And look, that's just a rumor, so take it for whatever it's [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=379.96s)]
*  worth, right? But what's not a rumor is what Axios is reporting. Several countries, three [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=384.08000000000004s)]
*  countries approached and considering helping Israel do an ethnic cleansing of Gaza. And [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=389.76s)]
*  why? Why? They just want to clear out Gaza, get some fresh air? No, what did we tell you? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=395.24s)]
*  Their plan all along is greater Israel. And we didn't come up with that because it's a [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=401.32s)]
*  conspiracy theory or we're some sort of geniuses. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=405.84000000000003s)]
*  They say it all the time, cabinet members in Israel. Smotrich gave another speech about [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=409.48s)]
*  it recently. They're like, yeah, why don't we just slaughter them and we'll use the hostages [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=414.88s)]
*  as an excuse. Well, they didn't give the hostages back. And so we'll then ship the 2 million [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=419.76s)]
*  out and we'll take Gaza, we'll move our settlers in. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=424.04s)]
*  And right now one of the things they wanna do is push all of them into a quote unquote [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=426.92s)]
*  humanitarian zone, because it's 1984. So if you're gonna do genocide and ethnic cleansing, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=430.04s)]
*  you call it a humanitarian zone. Push 2 million people into a tiny space so it's easier to [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=435.16s)]
*  ship them out. I mean, in the old days it was trains, now it's planes. So this is a [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=440.6s)]
*  sick, sick genocide of the Palestinian people. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=446.04s)]
*  And the Israeli cabinet is saying it out loud, let alone what Mossad is doing behind the [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=450.16s)]
*  scenes. I'm super curious if any supporter of Israel is ever going to turn around and [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=454.96000000000004s)]
*  go, I called you anti-Semitic and I said it was this and I said it was that. And now they're [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=460.08000000000004s)]
*  actually doing exactly what you said. I was wrong, I'm against it, I wanna help. Is that [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=465.12s)]
*  gonna happen? I mean, we always talk about how Trump guys are cult. Are any Trump guys [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=473.6s)]
*  ever gonna turn around? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=478.88s)]
*  What a cult. Are any Israeli supporters ever gonna turn around? I'm not talking about Jewish [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=480.64s)]
*  Americans, those are Jewish Americans are already against this. I'm talking about people [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=486.24s)]
*  defending Israel to this day in the middle of one of the worst slaughters we have ever [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=489.92s)]
*  seen in our lifetime. Over 50,000 butchered at a minimum, over 15,000 children massacred. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=494.76s)]
*  And still not, that could be human shields, but you still doing propaganda over this? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=502.92s)]
*  You're still gonna do propaganda over this when they're announcing, yes, we are planning [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=507.68s)]
*  to steal the land. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=512.38s)]
*  That was the point all along. By the way, I don't believe for a second that they didn't [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=513.88s)]
*  know that October 7th was gonna happen. Besides, we literally know that they knew. Israeli [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=518.64s)]
*  press has reported that they knew. Golly, the best intelligence agency in the world [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=522.96s)]
*  that did that beeper thing. They just snuck by us, no. And if you really love Israel, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=529.28s)]
*  understand what these monsters in that government did. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=538.28s)]
*  Not only to the Palestinians, but to your own people. And that's what drives me crazy [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=542.84s)]
*  about Israeli supporters. I get why, because of the trauma of the past, etc. And they think, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=547.82s)]
*  no, we gotta protect our own and we're the victims. And they have been the victims in [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=552.44s)]
*  the past. But guys, snap out of it. Because this whole idea of no matter who's in charge [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=557.12s)]
*  of Israel, no matter how right-wing they are, no matter how monstrous they are, no, they're [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=564.48s)]
*  pure as the German stone. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=569.84s)]
*  I'll defend them, I'll defend them, I'll defend them. Because Israel is the one country that [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=571.32s)]
*  cannot have a bad leader. Everything is moral. They're the one country in the world that [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=576.0s)]
*  cannot have a government that ever makes bad decisions or immoral decisions. They're [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=581.76s)]
*  the one holy moral country. You have to be really detached from reality, believe that. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=586.24s)]
*  Especially in the middle of now they're announced, planned genocide and ethnic cleansing. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=591.12s)]
*  Yeah, you mentioned this is all very sick. And one thing that struck me as being very [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=596.84s)]
*  sick is that Donald Trump is saying in that clip we showed earlier, that we're gonna take [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=602.76s)]
*  them away from this place where they're not getting stabbed and shot. And meanwhile, you'd [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=607.72s)]
*  pointed out the person or the people stabbing and shooting them were Netanyahu. The murder [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=613.24s)]
*  is sitting right next to him. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=620.2s)]
*  And he's saying we're gonna take them away. It's like saying we're gonna move the victims [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=622.0400000000001s)]
*  out of the neighborhood so this guy will stop killing them. And this guy's just sitting [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=626.28s)]
*  there smiling about it. And I'm going, what a sick and twisted reality. They're saying [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=630.2s)]
*  we need to get you away for safety from this guy who's sitting right next to me. And he's [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=636.08s)]
*  just smiling and going, yeah, yeah. I mean, the pretense of it all is just so sick. And [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=642.44s)]
*  not to mention the fact that the world, the Western world right now is taking in a lot [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=650.0s)]
*  refugees from wars, whether it was Syria or Ukraine or wherever. And then you have these, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=658.3599999999999s)]
*  you have the pushback from the right in many countries, whether it's America or Germany [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=666.28s)]
*  or wherever in Europe saying, we don't want any more migrants. We don't want any migrants. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=672.3599999999999s)]
*  Well, then stop supporting wars and work on stopping wars. Stop going at the UN Council [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=676.76s)]
*  and voting against a ceasefire. Stop that. If you don't want migrants coming to you, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=683.88s)]
*  if you don't want refugees fleeing their land and coming to your country, then stop it. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=691.24s)]
*  Then do something about it. Stand on some moral ground and they don't. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=697.24s)]
*  And then the other thing I will point out is that during the election, obviously a lot of [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=700.68s)]
*  Palestinians and a lot of pro-Palestinians voted for Donald Trump because they thought that he's [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=706.12s)]
*  going to do something better for them. And I was always saying whether it's Trump or it's Biden, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=711.24s)]
*  it's Democrat or Republican, the policy is the policy. And the policy is to support [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=716.12s)]
*  Israel blindly. And to your point, I think that if you love Israel or if you love your own country, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=722.12s)]
*  you should be able to criticize their leadership for their policies. That's part of being a Western [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=728.92s)]
*  democracy. And the final, final thing I will say is, once again, observing countries like Iran [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=736.2s)]
*  that are an Islamic totalitarian state, anytime you put religion into the game and you have people [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=742.12s)]
*  in Israel, like you said, Smotra, the far right people who believe that they start talking about [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=750.5200000000001s)]
*  God and how it's their right and all that other stuff, that's where I think you end up with a [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=757.72s)]
*  society where it's harder to criticize that leadership because they always defer to the idea [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=762.6s)]
*  that God wanted this, this is God. And by the way, one final thing, we are seeing our own country [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=770.12s)]
*  move in that direction when you have people on the right saying that Donald Trump was God bringing him [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=777.4s)]
*  to us and we're going to have to go further and further to the right. So there's a lot of [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=784.76s)]
*  repercussions to all of this and it is just unbelievable that these discussions are being [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=789.8s)]
*  had and that America is standing by and just doing same old, same old. I mean, that's just [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=796.52s)]
*  been what it is. Yeah, so last thing is I promised who can stop them and that is not a long list, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=804.12s)]
*  okay? I'm not sure it's really anyone, but I'll tell you who can't stop them real quick, the world. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=812.28s)]
*  What are they gonna do? Like attack Israel? No, then America will attack them. So nobody can do [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=819.0s)]
*  anything about that, right? I mean, they could start a giant war, I'll get to that in a second, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=827.48s)]
*  but certainly Europe's not gonna do anything. Most of their governments are captured by Israel [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=831.48s)]
*  and even if they weren't, what are they gonna do? There's literally nothing they could do. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=837.48s)]
*  China's not gonna do anything, Russia's not gonna do anything, the world's not the answer. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=840.6800000000001s)]
*  Our politicians are 90% corrupt. They almost all work for Israel, take APAC money, the largest [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=844.3599999999999s)]
*  donor for half the politicians in America are APAC. So they're totally corrupt and gone. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=851.16s)]
*  At the left, nobody ever listens to the left, so I wish, I wish one day, one day, but not today. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=856.4399999999999s)]
*  So who's left? Look, one group is Jewish Americans, so I'm not putting it on them like [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=862.3599999999999s)]
*  people do when there's like some fundamentalist Muslim does a bombing, a terrorist attack, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=869.4s)]
*  and then all Muslims are responsible and you all have to apologize. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=874.68s)]
*  No, no, no, no, Jewish Americans are not responsible, they don't have to apologize, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=877.88s)]
*  etc., etc. But do they have collective power that could make a difference for good? [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=881.24s)]
*  I think they do. And I hope that they begin to realize this is not helping anyone. It's not [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=887.0s)]
*  helping the Jewish community, it's not helping Israel. We gotta get them out of this fight. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=893.16s)]
*  Israel's basically like a 280 pound guy got into a bar fight. And you don't look as a friend and [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=897.08s)]
*  you wanna say, and Jewish Americans are not Israelis, they're Americans. But as a friend, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=902.84s)]
*  you wanna say, okay, I support my brother in the fight. But now, no matter who started and where [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=906.5200000000001s)]
*  it was, he's got a 120 pound guy underneath him. And he's just bashing the living crap out of him, [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=912.0400000000001s)]
*  and he's about to die. That's when a friend comes in and stops the guy, right? That doesn't encourage [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=917.5600000000001s)]
*  him and enable him and go, go get him, you're the victim. You're the victim, keep pounding him. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=924.28s)]
*  No, don't do that. So I have faith that that can happen. So I hope that something snaps [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=929.8s)]
*  in a way that's positive and leads in that direction. But the only other group that [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=941.4s)]
*  can make a difference and maybe more realistic, cuz Jewish Americans are still a small group overall, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=946.28s)]
*  is the right wing. So again, the right wing's not fully responsible. Nobody's fully responsible, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=950.76s)]
*  but I'm talking about people who can make a difference. So why? If they turn on Israel, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=957.08s)]
*  there's some percentage chance that Trump will listen to his base. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=965.3199999999999s)]
*  And that's not a guarantee at all, because he does not listen to his base when they want him [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=969.96s)]
*  to cut defense and they want him to do all these things. Instead, he's just giving corporations [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=974.6s)]
*  more subsidies, more giveaways, more tax cuts, etc. But on some things, when his base is angry [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=979.24s)]
*  enough, he turns around. Now they could do that at some point when they get mad enough, [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=984.84s)]
*  but I haven't seen it yet. And but we're at the beginning of his term. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=988.36s)]
*  Or the disaster scenario where they're starting to put people on trains and planes and [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=992.44s)]
*  they're shackling them and just they've put them in the veiled pen of the so-called humanitarian [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=998.92s)]
*  zone and people are being butchered, etc. And what? The Muslim world just erupts. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=1005.32s)]
*  I can't, I'm not gonna let you, I mean, this is now getting to a point where are we past genocide? [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=1012.5200000000001s)]
*  Are we at the next word? What is this? And so the populations of Egypt, Jordan, and all the [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=1017.08s)]
*  neighboring countries can just go, that's it, that's it. If you're not attacking Israel, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=1023.48s)]
*  we're attacking you. And if you think, I'm not encouraging, I think that's a disaster, epic [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=1028.44s)]
*  disaster. But if you think, no, people will know that they are defeated and all Muslims across the [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=1032.68s)]
*  world will say, of course, Israel is our Lord and Savior and they can oppress, humiliate, destroy, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=1038.6000000000001s)]
*  and kill, and ethnically cleanse all of us. And we will never ever fight back [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=1043.72s)]
*  because then we will be called terrorists by American media. Yeah, you can call them all you [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=1048.28s)]
*  want, but at some point human beings snap. So we might have the biggest bloody mess you've ever [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=1052.76s)]
*  seen in your life in Gaza. And Trump in the beginning will say, keep deport, keep shipping [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=1059.96s)]
*  them out. You send me money and you destroy and kill and move out any Palestinians you like. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=1066.3600000000001s)]
*  And maybe, just maybe, in those kind of disaster scenarios, even the right wing goes, why? Why did [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=1073.08s)]
*  we get ourselves in the middle of a giant, giant conflict? And we have to pay for it when you ran [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=1080.76s)]
*  on anti-war. Now, a lot of you will say, yeah, I don't believe that Trump voters [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=1088.04s)]
*  were ever anti-war. I think they're giant liars about everything. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=1094.6000000000001s)]
*  I disagree. Whether they hold Trump accountable is a different question and we're all gonna find out. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wXM9ada7Y&t=1098.28s)]
