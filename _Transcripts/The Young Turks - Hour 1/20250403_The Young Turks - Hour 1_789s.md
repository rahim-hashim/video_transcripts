"Senate Republicans on Wednesday unveiled a 70-page budget resolution that they say would give Senate Budget Committee Chair Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a staunch ally of President Trump, the power to determine whether extending the 2017 Trump tax cuts officially adds to the federal deficit.

Republicans say the bill empowers Graham to use a ‚Äúcurrent policy‚Äù budget baseline to score an extension of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as not adding to the deficit, neither in the 10-year budget window from 2025 to 2034 nor in the years beyond that window."

# What Is HIDING In The Senate Budget Resolution?
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [April 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8)
*  We are in conversations, as you know, with the parliamentarian about the best way to get budget reconciliation we're trying to accomplish across the finish line. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=0.0s)]
*  But we think the law is very clear. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=9.6s)]
*  So Republicans, in essence, want to pretend like their trillion dollar tax cuts are free, like magic. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=12.0s)]
*  Or as Chip Roy, one of the most conservative Republicans around here, said, like fairy dust. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=19.0s)]
*  A middle school math student could tell you this is ridiculous. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=25.0s)]
*  Remember the $4.5 trillion in tax cuts that Donald Trump was pursuing? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=30.88s)]
*  Yeah, make that $6 trillion. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=37.0s)]
*  And that's based on the Senate Republicans' release of a 70 page budget blueprint that would pave the way for an additional $1.5 trillion in new tax cuts on top of the $4.5 trillion. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=39.0s)]
*  And that's a lot. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=54.0s)]
*  That is certainly a lot. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=56.0s)]
*  But they are doing some tricky-poozy math to pretend as though their tax giveaways aren't really going to cost us all that much, that it's not going to add to the American debt. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=58.0s)]
*  It will. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=69.0s)]
*  Now, Senate Budget Chairman Lindsey Graham unveiled the sweeping new budget resolution that raises the debt ceiling, moves forward with Trump's tax cuts, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=70.0s)]
*  includes Trump's border policies, meaning more funding for border security, and his defense and energy priorities. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=80.0s)]
*  Now, the resolution they unveiled on Wednesday would increase the debt limit by $5 trillion. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=87.0s)]
*  Additionally, the measure opens the door to a $150 billion increase to military spending and $175 billion more for immigration enforcement to help Trump carry out his mass deportation plan. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=94.0s)]
*  And as for the spending cuts, still a work in progress. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=108.0s)]
*  The Senate sets a much lower floor of $1 billion in reductions, each for committees handling health care, food stamps, and other programs. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=113.0s)]
*  However, that can be raised if needed to compromise with the House's estimated $2 trillion in cuts. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=124.0s)]
*  So do you guys understand what's happening here? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=132.0s)]
*  The Senate blueprint added even more in tax cuts. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=134.0s)]
*  And whether you're talking about the House or the Senate, both chambers are looking to cut our social safety net in order to justify increasing tax cuts. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=140.0s)]
*  Yeah, so the number one goal of the Uniparty, whether it's establishment Republicans or establishment Democrats, my entire life has been tax cuts for the rich and for corporations. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=152.0s)]
*  So Donald Trump ran as a populist, said that he wasn't going to do any of that. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=165.0s)]
*  But that didn't make any sense because he'd already promised a giant tax cut during his campaign. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=170.0s)]
*  And then when he got in, of course, number one priority was a giant tax cut. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=174.0s)]
*  So renewing his taxes from his first term cost four to four and a half trillion dollars, depending on which source you look at. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=178.0s)]
*  So now the point that Anna made is that we're going to add another one and a half trillion dollars. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=186.0s)]
*  Okay, on top of that, because it's never enough for the rich, it's never enough for the donors. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=191.0s)]
*  So guys, number one, first of all, understand this. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=195.0s)]
*  Doge, all big cuts, big cuts, even if every cut was true and correct, it's only $130 billion. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=199.0s)]
*  Okay, so then you've got the gold cards. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=206.0s)]
*  Donald Trump said, oh, it'll create trillions of dollars. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=210.0s)]
*  To my knowledge, no one's bought one. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=212.0s)]
*  Maybe three people will buy one eventually. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=214.0s)]
*  The gold card is basically rich foreigners who want US citizenship, so they buy it for $5 million. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=216.0s)]
*  These nuclear tariffs, I wonder how much they say they're going to raise. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=222.0s)]
*  Well, let's show you the math real quick, and then we'll come back and tell you their magic trick. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=225.0s)]
*  They have this hilarious magic trick. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=228.0s)]
*  So four trillion at a minimum, but other places like the higher tax foundation says four and a half. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=230.0s)]
*  Then you add the one and a half, you get the five and a half to six trillion. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=235.0s)]
*  Now, where have I heard this number before? Six trillion, six trillion. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=238.0s)]
*  Well, let's find out. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=242.0s)]
*  The other tariffs are going to raise about $600 billion a year, about six trillion over a 10-year period. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=245.0s)]
*  So far, it looks like we're going to have about $6 trillion of investments. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=251.0s)]
*  And you wouldn't do that in years in this country over the last number of years. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=255.0s)]
*  Six trillion dollars, and that's going to be much higher by the end of the year. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=260.0s)]
*  And think of what $6 trillion is. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=265.0s)]
*  You wouldn't have even a small percentage of that under this other system. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=268.0s)]
*  We're going to be an entirely different country. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=273.0s)]
*  They need to account for $6 trillion in taxes for the rich. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=277.0s)]
*  And here comes this tariff plan, which they magically this week start saying is going to save us $6 trillion. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=281.0s)]
*  Gee, look, I challenged Carrie Lake and others on Piers Morgan panel about this. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=288.0s)]
*  Let's take a quick look at that. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=293.0s)]
*  All of this is actually just a ruse to pass out four and a half trillion dollar tax cut. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=295.0s)]
*  Because they want to be able to say what you guys just talked about. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=301.0s)]
*  No, the tariffs will magically bring us $6 trillion over a decade. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=304.0s)]
*  So don't worry about that four and a half trillion dollars are going to funnel to all of our donors, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=307.0s)]
*  the Elon Musk, the Donald Trump, and to all the richest people in the country and to corporations. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=311.0s)]
*  That's what all of this tariff nonsense is about. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=316.0s)]
*  That's what the gold card nonsense is about. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=318.0s)]
*  That's what Doge nonsense is all about. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=320.0s)]
*  It's all to say, don't worry about how we're going to blow up the debt and the deficit by doing another [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=322.0s)]
*  gigantic tax cut for the rich and for corporations. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=328.0s)]
*  What I loved about that is at the end of the show, Piers Morgan invited all of us to come back on [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=332.0s)]
*  four months from now and see how it turned out. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=337.0s)]
*  Because Carrie Lake and Batya were like, no way. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=339.0s)]
*  Okay, these tariffs are going to last forever and they're going to be amazing. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=342.0s)]
*  And they're going to bring on all this money. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=345.0s)]
*  And a lot of Republicans voters don't even realize that we're about to give away $5 to $6 trillion to the rich. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=347.0s)]
*  They don't even know it. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=355.0s)]
*  Like when I say that, that can't be true, right? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=356.0s)]
*  What, really? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=359.0s)]
*  Yeah, because all we are talking about is tariffs and Doge, etc. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=360.0s)]
*  No one's talking about the giant tax cuts. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=364.0s)]
*  That's true. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=366.0s)]
*  And you know why they're not talking about them? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=367.0s)]
*  Because number one, the Republicans, they want to pass it in the middle of the night. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=369.0s)]
*  They do. That is true. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=373.0s)]
*  And there's all sorts of convenient distractions. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=374.0s)]
*  And they know that if they make a big deal out of it, it'll be deeply unpopular. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=378.0s)]
*  It's already polling very, very negatively. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=382.0s)]
*  And they're not releasing the details of how much is going to go to corporations and what an enormous percentage go to the rich, right? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=385.0s)]
*  They're trying to keep that all under wraps, pass it in the middle of the night, and then go, well, look at that. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=392.0s)]
*  I guess that's what the American people want. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=398.0s)]
*  And the Democrats should be screaming from the rooftops about this giveaway for the rich. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=400.0s)]
*  You saw Schumer mention it there. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=404.0s)]
*  But really, there should be a coordinated attack here. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=406.0s)]
*  And I just don't see it at all, because this is super unpopular and not at all populist. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=409.0s)]
*  Yes, I'm sure the super wealthy Democrats in Congress who have become super wealthy as a result of their insider trading on information that we're not privy to, I'm sure they really do not want to cut taxes. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=414.0s)]
*  They're very worried about this tax bill. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=428.0s)]
*  And by the way- [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=431.0s)]
*  I don't believe, I don't buy for a second that Democrats in Congress don't want to cut taxes. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=432.0s)]
*  So look, my whole life, we've cut taxes under Republicans, even though Democrats had plenty of people in Congress to block them. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=437.0s)]
*  No matter what happens, the Democrats' excuse is always, there was nothing we could do. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=445.0s)]
*  There was nothing we could do. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=450.0s)]
*  And they're getting ready to sing that imminently right now. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=451.0s)]
*  And by the way, that Piers Morgan appearance was just yesterday. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=454.0s)]
*  Between yesterday and today, they added another $1.5 trillion in tax cuts. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=458.0s)]
*  That's the story we're reporting now. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=461.0s)]
*  Okay, so understand, take a look at the big picture, okay? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=464.0s)]
*  Because understand what's happening right now. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=467.0s)]
*  American consumers are about to deal with an insane amount of inflation as a result of Donald Trump's tax policies. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=470.0s)]
*  And you're right, he is a real believer. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=478.0s)]
*  He genuinely thinks you can even just get rid of the income tax and replace it with high tariffs on foreign imports. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=480.0s)]
*  And that's how the federal government will raise revenue to function. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=488.0s)]
*  Okay, but what that ends up doing is it moves all of the taxes, because tariffs are taxes, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=493.0s)]
*  onto American consumers while giving the wealthiest among us a massive tax cut. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=499.0s)]
*  That's such a great point. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=505.0s)]
*  Again, that's like a double whammy against populism. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=507.0s)]
*  Because even if tariffs did work, Anna's right, we all pay that when we have higher prices for cars, beer, coke, etc. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=511.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=520.0s)]
*  But meanwhile, they're like, it's all even. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=521.0s)]
*  It's not even because the tax cuts are almost all going to the rich. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=524.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's redistributing wealth from the bottom to the top again. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=527.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=530.0s)]
*  It's just another method of doing it. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=531.0s)]
*  Least populist thing you can do. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=532.0s)]
*  That's a great point, Anna. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=535.0s)]
*  Oh my gosh, okay, so- [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=537.0s)]
*  So now the magic trick. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=538.0s)]
*  So let's talk a little bit about the Senate parliamentarian. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=539.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=543.0s)]
*  Because- [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=544.0s)]
*  That person is the most important person in government. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=545.0s)]
*  Most important person in government- [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=547.0s)]
*  That's what the Democrats tell us. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=548.0s)]
*  According to Democrats, yeah. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=549.0s)]
*  Democrats are like- [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=550.0s)]
*  Whenever they're in charge. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=551.0s)]
*  We really wanted to pass the Build Back Better agenda, but we just couldn't do it. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=552.0s)]
*  The Senate parliamentarian really stands in the way. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=556.0s)]
*  So in order to pass legislation in the Senate, you have that legislative filibuster, right? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=559.0s)]
*  And that legislative filibuster requires a threshold of 60 out of 100 senators in order to pass legislation. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=565.0s)]
*  However, there are certain instances where if the policy has an impact on the federal budget, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=571.0s)]
*  you can actually pass it through reconciliation or through a simple majority of 51 senators as opposed to 60 senators. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=577.0s)]
*  Now, the individual who weighs in on whether or not you can do that with any given piece of legislation is the Senate parliamentarian. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=584.0s)]
*  And in this case, with the Senate's blueprint for their budget, they're like, yeah, yeah, we're not really that worried about the Senate parliamentarian, essentially. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=591.0s)]
*  Not essentially, they just said- [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=600.0s)]
*  They just said it. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=602.0s)]
*  Yeah, they're like, look, the Senate parliamentarian said basically that they could do, the budget can go forward. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=603.0s)]
*  But that's not a controversial thing to say at all. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=610.0s)]
*  Yeah, the budget involves money. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=613.0s)]
*  It makes perfect sense. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=615.0s)]
*  That person did not rule on whether taking $4.5 trillion in tax cuts and making them permanent does not affect the budget, right? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=617.0s)]
*  And the Republicans just pretended that they did. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=628.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=631.0s)]
*  They just made it up out of whole clause. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=632.0s)]
*  But that goes to the point that Ana and I have been saying for a long time on this show. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=634.0s)]
*  So the Republicans are like parliamentarian, who cares? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=638.0s)]
*  We're just going to ignore them, okay? [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=641.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=643.0s)]
*  And now what does that do? [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=644.0s)]
*  That puts the Democrats in a position of trying to defend the parliamentarian, which is going to play very poorly in politics, right? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=646.0s)]
*  No, but you cannot do that bill that you want because of the parliamentarian. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=654.0s)]
*  But they will. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=658.0s)]
*  Look, Democrats love the parliamentarian. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=659.0s)]
*  They love the legislative filibuster. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=662.0s)]
*  It is the convenient excuse for why they can't get anything in their agenda passed. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=664.0s)]
*  And I say agenda because, look, when Republicans want something, they bulldoze, they steamroll, they do whatever they need to do to get it done. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=670.0s)]
*  Democrats will campaign on things that might be popular, economic policies that might be popular, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=678.0s)]
*  knowing that there are certain obstacles baked into the system that they can point to as their excuse for why they couldn't get it done. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=684.0s)]
*  And by the way, just to give you the specifics, as reported by the Associated Press, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=690.0s)]
*  typically the current policy baseline proposal would need to pass the muster of the Senate's nonpartisan parliamentarian to make sure it abides by the strict rules of the budget process. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=695.0s)]
*  Senators from both parties have been arguing in closed door sessions with the parliamentarian staff for and against the idea. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=707.0s)]
*  But Republicans are pressing ahead for now, regardless of the outcome. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=715.0s)]
*  They know that they're going to get what they want. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=720.0s)]
*  Look, they're going to pass this tax bill. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=722.0s)]
*  That's what this is, essentially. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=725.0s)]
*  It's a tax bill. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=726.0s)]
*  They're going to pass it. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=727.0s)]
*  And here's another instance, and we're really going on a limb here because the Democrats claim the parliamentarian is maybe the most powerful person in all of government because they can literally stop bills and say, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=728.0s)]
*  no, you need a 60 person vote on that and they can never get a 60 person vote, right? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=739.0s)]
*  So our theory, and we told it to you not now, but years ago, for all these years we've been telling you, the parliamentarian is irrelevant. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=744.0s)]
*  You could just either fire them or ignore them. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=752.0s)]
*  So now the Republicans are going to try to ignore the parliamentarian as we told you that they could. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=755.0s)]
*  Will they be allowed to get away with it or will the entire government stop and go, Republicans, you are wrong. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=759.0s)]
*  The parliamentarian is the most important person and they will decide the fate of this bill. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=766.0s)]
*  Let's find out. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=772.0s)]
*  Let's find out together, okay? [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=773.0s)]
*  Because the Democrats will ask for that. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=774.0s)]
*  And my guess is you all see with your own eyes, nobody's going to give a rat's ass about the parliamentarian. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=776.0s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below, an angel gets a swings. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=782.0s)]
*  Totally not true, but it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiYPvWt8il8&t=785.0s)]
