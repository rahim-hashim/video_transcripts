TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.

# Brian Kilmeade: ARREST John Cusack & Jasmine Crockett!!!
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [March 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ)
*  And this guy, John Cusack, who's an actor with marginal success, is actually calling [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=0.0s)]
*  on March 29th to be the day to blow up Tesla's and Crockett too, he should be indicted. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=5.8s)]
*  Okay, so it is not enough for Brian Kilmeade and for the right that anyone who has scuffed [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=12.08s)]
*  the paint of one of Elon Musk's products be charged with terrorism and maybe shipped to [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  a Salvadoran prison. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=24.2s)]
*  We'll get to that. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=25.84s)]
*  Any person out there in politics or in pop culture, actors with marginal success, what [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=27.6s)]
*  are you talking about Kilmeade? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=33.120000000000005s)]
*  They also should probably suffer some sort of state violence and there his excuses, they're [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=36.36s)]
*  calling for them to be blown up. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=41.96s)]
*  No they're not. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=44.52s)]
*  That's not remotely true. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=45.64s)]
*  That is a vicious bit of slander against him and particularly against representative Jasmine [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=47.36s)]
*  Crockett who's been very specific that she supports nonviolent protest against Tesla. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=52.24s)]
*  She said it over and over and over again and just like when we hear on TYT say it, it's [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=59.800000000000004s)]
*  pointless and we never get any credit for the constant caveats and all that that we [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=66.24000000000001s)]
*  do. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=71.36s)]
*  They just imply that she should probably go to prison too and so that's what they're doing. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=72.36s)]
*  To be fair, let's go to a little bit of the actual raw video. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=77.08s)]
*  So here is that marginally successful actor Jesus and Jasmine Crockett talking. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=80.12s)]
*  Well let me tell you on March 29th, I want you to raise your voices all over the world [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=86.16000000000001s)]
*  and I want you to be heard. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=92.04s)]
*  Heard in such a way that no matter how much they try to ignore you, they just can't. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=94.68s)]
*  And what we are seeing is that because people are driving this movement, we've seen that [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=99.88000000000001s)]
*  now the board is saying, hey, Elon, you need to step aside because you're messing up everything. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=105.44s)]
*  We saw here recently that Tesla is not being welcomed in Canada and Vancouver because they [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=111.04s)]
*  are afraid of what may come along with that. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=118.64s)]
*  Musk is a pathological liar. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=122.28s)]
*  He's a criminal. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=124.84s)]
*  He's a sociopath and a ghoul. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=127.12s)]
*  I mean those terms very precisely because who else would use his own child as a sympathy [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=129.83999999999997s)]
*  prop while literally taking starving aid away from people all over the world. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=137.79999999999998s)]
*  He's literally killing people. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=143.16s)]
*  People are going to die because of this madness. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=144.92s)]
*  Look, if you're on the right, you cannot like what Crockett and Cusack said. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=146.88s)]
*  I also would not want to be reminded that their god emperors are these incredibly flawed [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=151.48s)]
*  people in basically every way. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=156.51999999999998s)]
*  That doesn't make them terrorists. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=158.68s)]
*  Again, you not liking hearing a thing doesn't mean that the person that said it should be [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=160.28s)]
*  locked up. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=166.28s)]
*  I understand that you free speech radicals have landed on that as the solution to all [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=167.28s)]
*  of your problems. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=170.44s)]
*  But no, that's not actually how America is supposed to work. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=171.44s)]
*  At least as of right now, we have some rights. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=173.84s)]
*  Not as many as some of us had when we were born. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=176.52s)]
*  A lot of it's been dialed back by Donald Trump and the MAGA movement, but we still have some. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=178.92000000000002s)]
*  In any event, they called for nonviolent protest and they are being constantly lied about by [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=183.08s)]
*  Kilmeade, also by Marjorie Greene, who took 14 seconds of video that Laura Loomer spread [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=188.52s)]
*  to make it seem as if Jasmine Crockett was saying that she wants Elon Musk to be physically [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=195.64s)]
*  taken out. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=200.64s)]
*  Again, nonviolent, they constantly said it over and over and over again. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=201.8s)]
*  Laura Loomer cut that out. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=205.4s)]
*  She's a liar, obviously a propagandist. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=206.96s)]
*  The actual website for the protest movement that they're doing the stream for says they're [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=210.0s)]
*  a peaceful protest movement. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=213.76s)]
*  They oppose violence, vandalism, the destruction of property. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=214.92s)]
*  They're very clear about that. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=218.2s)]
*  Very clear in a way that I wish the organizers of January 6th perhaps had been a little bit [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=220.0s)]
*  clear. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=223.95999999999998s)]
*  We might have avoided a lot of problems in America. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=224.95999999999998s)]
*  But again, they're all attacking them. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=226.83999999999997s)]
*  And as we go into our discussion, feel free to put up graphic three so you can see that [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=228.51999999999998s)]
*  Donald Trump is in fact calling for the people who burned cars to disappear into the Salvadoran [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=232.04s)]
*  prison system. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=240.28s)]
*  So Jordan, again, if you speak up for peace, you're disappeared. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=241.67999999999998s)]
*  Any critics, they just want to lock up anyone for no matter how small their infraction is. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=247.08s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=253.4s)]
*  Yeah, it would be funny if it wasn't so sad. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=256.40000000000003s)]
*  And the same situation over and over again, I find myself in, does anybody care? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=260.16s)]
*  Is there anybody on the right with even the smallest amount of principles here? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=265.88s)]
*  Because they've treated free speech and their defense of it as like an aesthetic rather [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=272.38s)]
*  than an ideal. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=277.74s)]
*  And you're seeing it here because these are just like unthinkably egregious violations [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=278.74s)]
*  of people's First Amendment rights. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=283.76s)]
*  You don't like you're saying, John, you don't have to agree with this. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=285.82s)]
*  But even some of the more radical right wing folks will still pretend like they care about [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=288.7s)]
*  freedom of speech and sometimes they'll apply it to a liberal cause. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=295.26s)]
*  It's seldom few and far between, but this is like, we're going to deport you. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=301.14s)]
*  We're going to send you to El Salvador if you damage a Tesla. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=305.22s)]
*  This protest movement isn't even doing that. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=310.3s)]
*  Maybe there are some saboteurs who are. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=312.26s)]
*  The punishment is not deportation. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=316.96s)]
*  It's ridiculous. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=320.06s)]
*  It's pathetic to see how they want to try to reframe this movement as domestic terrorism. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=322.02s)]
*  In other circumstances, you would say, well, the government's meddling in private businesses. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=327.94s)]
*  We saw that over Biden's term. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=331.46s)]
*  We saw that for Obama's terms. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=333.05999999999995s)]
*  Anytime there's a government involvement to try to prop up a business on the left or suppress [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=335.94s)]
*  a business interest on the left, they're up in arms. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=340.78s)]
*  Well, the government should be meddling in free enterprise. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=344.5s)]
*  Well, consumers are pushing back and now they're not even they're not allowed to do that. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=346.82s)]
*  It's outlandish. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=351.53999999999996s)]
*  It's ridiculous. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=352.53999999999996s)]
*  On a lighter note, I think this is an opportunity for Mercedes-Benz to kind of break into that [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=354.1s)]
*  market with a new slogan, Nazi cars that don't blow up. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=359.06s)]
*  Under the Nazi bus immediately. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=365.3s)]
*  Yes, what do you think? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=368.34000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, first of all, an actor with marginal success. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=369.46000000000004s)]
*  Are you joking? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=372.18s)]
*  I'm offended on behalf of John Kisak. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=373.3s)]
*  He's actually one of my favorite actors. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=374.98s)]
*  I haven't seen all of his movies, but if he's in something, I'm much more likely to watch it. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=376.82000000000005s)]
*  But the thing is, John Kisak is not bothered about anything [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=381.14s)]
*  that Brian Kilmeade has to say about him. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=384.74s)]
*  He's been speaking out against people like Donald Trump and Elon Musk for years. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=386.82s)]
*  He's never incited violence, at least not as far as I've ever seen, nor has Jasmine Crockett. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=391.62s)]
*  She told the people to raise their voices. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=396.5s)]
*  How is that inciting violence? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=399.3s)]
*  Unless their feelings are so sensitive that harsh words actually are sticks and stones to them. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=401.06s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=405.86s)]
*  Also, I just wanna point out and clarify that the left did not start these fires. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=406.9s)]
*  These were people who started the fires, right? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=411.78s)]
*  This is not some rallying call for all leftists to just go start fires in places. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=413.78s)]
*  But this is incredibly serious. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=419.21999999999997s)]
*  And Jordan's point about this being an aesthetic is so spot on. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=420.98s)]
*  These people are patriots, right? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=424.9s)]
*  How many times in the earlier story did they refer to Elon Musk as a real good, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=426.65999999999997s)]
*  a great patriot, right? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=430.98s)]
*  As long as you're a patriot, you're good. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=433.14s)]
*  You're golden, you can't be touched. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=435.14s)]
*  They bleed red, white, and blue. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=436.82s)]
*  They love freedom and Jesus and Trump. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=438.26s)]
*  They're so American that it is their entire personality. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=440.26s)]
*  And they drive their trucks around with these big American or MAGA flags on the back of them. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=443.62s)]
*  Or maybe that's just me because I live in Texas and that's what I get to see. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=447.94s)]
*  But until they're asked to think even somewhat critically about the actual constitution and [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=451.14s)]
*  the Bill of Rights, they're so American. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=456.41999999999996s)]
*  But they can't comprehend that our government was founded on principles and ideologies. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=458.58s)]
*  And not just on what makes people feel good, right? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=463.62s)]
*  And sometimes those principles, when you apply them in certain situations, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=467.3s)]
*  they don't work out for you and other times they don't. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=471.14s)]
*  But there has to be some kind of moral benchmark or a baseline that you're operating from. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=473.3s)]
*  Otherwise, you get what we're getting now with Donald Trump. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=477.94s)]
*  If he doesn't like something, then it's illegal, right? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=480.58s)]
*  People aren't buying Teslas, it's illegal that you're not buying a Tesla. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=483.22s)]
*  Everyone needs to own a Tesla or else you're gonna go to jail or something. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=486.9s)]
*  I don't know, it just makes no sense. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=491.14s)]
*  But the thing is, it's so short-sighted because if they say, I don't like when the Democrats [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=493.78000000000003s)]
*  do that, so that's illegal. But the thing is, they also wanna do it, right? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=498.34000000000003s)]
*  They wanna do it whenever the favor has shifted towards them. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=502.1s)]
*  So I don't know what the overall plan is here. I don't know if we're gonna see people get thrown [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=506.82s)]
*  in jail or just speaking up saying things that Trump just doesn't like to hear or [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=511.86s)]
*  Republicans don't like to hear. So I don't know what the end game is here. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=517.22s)]
*  At this point, it could be anything, right? Because we're seeing a lot of things happen [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=520.98s)]
*  that we never imagined would have happened. A lot of people, including us here at TYT, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=524.74s)]
*  I feel like have been saying for a long time that this is where we're headed. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=529.54s)]
*  But at the time, it was like, you guys are being dramatic and that's not what's gonna happen, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=533.06s)]
*  blah, blah, blah. People don't believe anything until they actually see it in front of them. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=537.54s)]
*  Then they're like, how did we get here? Well, I'll tell you how we got here. Just go back a few [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=541.62s)]
*  months or a few years. This has been the state of play for a very long time. This is what they [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=546.34s)]
*  were always working towards. And here we are and now there's no rules, right? There's no [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=552.18s)]
*  parameters that anybody can fall back on. The checks and balances that we used to be able to rely on [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=556.58s)]
*  are being dismantled themselves or they've become corrupted. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=561.54s)]
*  And we've allowed them to become corrupted. And I don't know where we go from here. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=564.5s)]
*  Sorry to end on such a dour note. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=570.66s)]
*  Yeah, no, where we end is maybe people on the right being reminded that at one point, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=573.1400000000001s)]
*  they at least implied that they cared about rights and free speech and all that. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=579.0600000000001s)]
*  And look, I know that you didn't wanna end up in this dark place where most conservatives [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=583.0600000000001s)]
*  have been turned into the most pathetic and fragile snowflakes ever. It's just a trope now. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=588.34s)]
*  Anyone disagrees with you, deport them. American citizens, deport them. Congresspeople speak out, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=594.2600000000001s)]
*  deport them. Judges push back against Trump, deport them. They're American citizens. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=598.9000000000001s)]
*  But no, you don't get to be. Not if you disagree with me. I think that conservatives have been [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=602.74s)]
*  put into this really weak and fragile place where they are everything that they used to pretend [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=608.1s)]
*  that like liberal arts students in the Ivy League were. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=613.62s)]
*  And they're being encouraged in this because they're thought leaders on the right. They're [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=617.14s)]
*  politicians. That's their reaction every time somebody pushes back. They have no durability. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=620.74s)]
*  They have no adaptability. There's no argumentation. There's no debate anymore. And I mean that [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=626.34s)]
*  literally, you don't get to have a voice because if you do and if it's not what the emperor [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=632.18s)]
*  says is politically correct speech, then they will ship you out. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=637.6999999999999s)]
*  Again, the people they're talking about sending to El Salvador are not even migrants. That was [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=641.9399999999999s)]
*  already an insane thing that they were pushing. These are just American citizens that they think [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=646.8199999999999s)]
*  your position as an American is contingent on doing things that I guess that that Elon [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=652.42s)]
*  Musk approves of. I think that's a sad place and we're not gonna be able to solve this problem [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=657.78s)]
*  for them. They're gonna have to solve it for themselves. All we can do is stand up for the [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=662.1s)]
*  rights that Americans are supposed to have. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1btk1Xy-lJQ&t=666.1800000000001s)]
