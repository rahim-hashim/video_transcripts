TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.

# Bill Maher SPILLS On His Dinner With Trump
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [April 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag)
*  We came to dinner with me, Bill, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=0.0s)]
*  Dana White, and [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=2.4s)]
*  it could not have been better. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=3.58s)]
*  Everyone was so surprised, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=6.0200000000000005s)]
*  so pleasant. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  How about this, President Trump, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=8.58s)]
*  extending this olive branch and [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=10.58s)]
*  we talked about things we had in [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=12.34s)]
*  common, ending wokeness, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=14.14s)]
*  securing the border. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=15.9s)]
*  The President was asking him what [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=17.22s)]
*  he thought about policy going on [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  with Iran and Israel and things. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=21.580000000000002s)]
*  It just blew my mind. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=23.86s)]
*  I was very proud. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=25.82s)]
*  I think it takes so [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=30.02s)]
*  little to blow someone's ego up, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=31.1s)]
*  especially when they already had [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=32.88s)]
*  one to begin with. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=34.7s)]
*  Maybe that's what's going on here [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=35.78s)]
*  last month, mega superstar Kid Rock [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=37.86s)]
*  facilitated a dinner between [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=40.24s)]
*  himself, UFC President Dana White, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=42.06s)]
*  President Donald Trump, and [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=44.519999999999996s)]
*  avid Trump critic Bill Maher. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=46.54s)]
*  Interesting dinner conversation [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=48.58s)]
*  perhaps, apparently it went better [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=51.260000000000005s)]
*  than expected. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=53.980000000000004s)]
*  Jack, before we get into the [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=55.06s)]
*  details about the dinner, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=57.019999999999996s)]
*  I wonder what they serve. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=58.92s)]
*  What were your initial thoughts, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=61.0s)]
*  your reactions when you heard about [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=63.6s)]
*  Bill Maher getting invited to [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=66.26s)]
*  the White House? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=68.6s)]
*  Yeah, but I think it makes perfect [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=70.08s)]
*  sense. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=72.16s)]
*  If I was Bill Maher, I'd go, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=72.72s)]
*  I'll defend him all the way on [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=74.44s)]
*  going. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=76.2s)]
*  Of course, what happened at [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=76.75999999999999s)]
*  the dinner is relevant. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=78.52s)]
*  So let's find out what happened and [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=80.0s)]
*  then judge that as well. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=82.0s)]
*  Okay, let's do it. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=83.6s)]
*  While the dinner was two weeks ago, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=85.48s)]
*  at this point, Bill Maher opened up [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=88.02s)]
*  about the experience on this past [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=90.58s)]
*  Friday's episode of Real Time with [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=92.82s)]
*  Bill Maher and he laid everything [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=95.1s)]
*  out on the table for his audience, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=97.2s)]
*  transparency if you will. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=99.22s)]
*  As you know, 12 days ago, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=100.94s)]
*  I had dinner with President Trump, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=102.34s)]
*  a dinner that had been set up by [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=104.34s)]
*  my friend Kid Rock because we share [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=106.06s)]
*  belief that there's got to be [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=108.06s)]
*  something better than hurling [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=109.74000000000001s)]
*  insults from 3,000 miles away. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=111.5s)]
*  Let me first say that to all the [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=113.94s)]
*  people who treated this like it was [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=115.53999999999999s)]
*  some kind of summit meeting, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=117.39999999999999s)]
*  you're ridiculous. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=118.83999999999999s)]
*  Like I was going to sign [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=120.08s)]
*  a treaty or something. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=120.92s)]
*  I have no power. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=121.83999999999999s)]
*  I'm an effing comedian. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=123.08s)]
*  And he's the most powerful leader [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=124.96s)]
*  in the world. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=126.16s)]
*  I'm not the leader of anything [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=126.67999999999999s)]
*  except maybe a contingent of [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=128.32s)]
*  centrist minded people who think [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=129.96s)]
*  there's got to be a better way of [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=131.88s)]
*  running this country than hating [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=133.68s)]
*  each other every minute. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=135.64s)]
*  So how did the dinner go? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=137.6s)]
*  Well, off the bat, this dinner [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=139.28s)]
*  could have gone very badly. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=141.84s)]
*  As you've seen, as Mar brought [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=143.98000000000002s)]
*  a list of at least 60 names Trump [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=146.46s)]
*  has called him in the past. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=149.18s)]
*  So can you imagine? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=151.5s)]
*  I don't know that that would even [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=153.5s)]
*  embarrass Donald Trump, but [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=154.98000000000002s)]
*  Trump was a good sport about it, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=156.4s)]
*  apparently, signing it and [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=158.10000000000002s)]
*  having a grand old time. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=159.74s)]
*  So they got along, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=161.22s)]
*  the amosome jokes, levity. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=162.5s)]
*  Just for starters, he laughs. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=165.38s)]
*  I've never seen him laugh in public, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=167.62s)]
*  but he does, including at himself. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=170.18s)]
*  And it's not fake, believe me. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=173.28s)]
*  As a comedian of 40 years, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=175.68s)]
*  I know a fake laugh when I hear it. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=177.12s)]
*  I never felt I had to walk on [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=179.92s)]
*  eggshells around him. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=181.07999999999998s)]
*  And honestly, I voted for Clinton [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=182.04s)]
*  and Obama, but I would never feel [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=184.32s)]
*  comfortable talking to them. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=186.34s)]
*  The way I was able to talk with [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=189.07999999999998s)]
*  Donald Trump, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=190.51999999999998s)]
*  that's just how it went down. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=191.24s)]
*  Make it what you will. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=193.04s)]
*  It's emblematic of why the [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=194.96s)]
*  Democrats are so unpopular these [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=196.8s)]
*  days. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=199.12s)]
*  So the personalities, he vibes with [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=200.1s)]
*  one over perhaps the others. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=203.38s)]
*  Stereotyping, but [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=206.45999999999998s)]
*  perhaps living up to it. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=207.89999999999998s)]
*  Wasn't all jokes and laughter. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=209.73999999999998s)]
*  They also touched on some serious [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=212.1s)]
*  subjects and pressing issues, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=213.77999999999997s)]
*  which he did challenge President [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=215.45999999999998s)]
*  Trump on, according to Marr. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=217.22s)]
*  There were so many moments when, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=219.66s)]
*  well, I hit him with a joke, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=221.98s)]
*  contradicted something, and [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=223.89999999999998s)]
*  no problem. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=225.94s)]
*  At dinner, he was asking me about [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=227.42s)]
*  the nuclear situation in Iran in [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=228.96s)]
*  a very genuine, hey, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=230.56s)]
*  I think you're a smart guy. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=231.84s)]
*  I want your opinion sort of way. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=233.35999999999999s)]
*  I said, well, obviously, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=235.12s)]
*  you're privy to things about it, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=236.68s)]
*  and I'm not. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=238.68s)]
*  But for what it's worth, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=239.76s)]
*  I thought the Obama deal was worth [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=241.35999999999999s)]
*  letting play out because we made [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=243.66s)]
*  Iran destroy 98% of the uranium. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=245.86s)]
*  And they were 15 years away from [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=248.36s)]
*  a bomb. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=250.64s)]
*  And then I said to him, but [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=251.2s)]
*  we got rid of that, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=253.12s)]
*  you got rid of that. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=254.56s)]
*  He didn't get mad or [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=255.96s)]
*  call me a left-wing lunatic. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=257.73999999999995s)]
*  He took it in. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=260.29999999999995s)]
*  So there was that, and [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=262.73999999999995s)]
*  there were also some things that [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=263.97999999999996s)]
*  they agreed on, including the [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=265.82s)]
*  border needing to be controlled, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=267.65999999999997s)]
*  cops, DEI going too far, etc. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=269.82s)]
*  Seems like they got along [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=271.9s)]
*  fabulously. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=274.21999999999997s)]
*  And some way, somehow, Marr sort of [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=276.97999999999996s)]
*  changed his tune on Trump. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=279.85999999999996s)]
*  Why can't we get the guy I met to [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=282.14s)]
*  be the public guy? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=284.7s)]
*  We're not saying it's our [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=286.84000000000003s)]
*  responsibility to do that. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=288.16s)]
*  It's not, I'm just reporting [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=289.76s)]
*  exactly what I saw over two and [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=291.04s)]
*  a half hours. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=292.44s)]
*  A crazy person doesn't live in [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=293.0s)]
*  the White House. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=294.76s)]
*  Person who plays a crazy person on [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=296.24s)]
*  TV a lot lives there, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=298.64s)]
*  which I know is effed up. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=300.2s)]
*  It's not as effed up as I thought [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=302.32s)]
*  it was. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=304.6s)]
*  So there you have it, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=306.76s)]
*  you can hate me for it. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=307.64s)]
*  But I'm not a liar. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=309.08000000000004s)]
*  Trump was gracious, measured. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=310.12s)]
*  Why he isn't that in other [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=312.64s)]
*  settings, I don't know and [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=314.0s)]
*  I can't answer. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=315.56s)]
*  It's not my place to answer. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=316.7s)]
*  I'm just telling you what I saw and [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=318.82s)]
*  I wasn't high. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=321.74s)]
*  Now, he clarified that he did not [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=323.78000000000003s)]
*  go full MAGA following the dinner [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=326.18s)]
*  and is still a staunch liberal. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=328.78000000000003s)]
*  But he does view Trump in [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=332.22s)]
*  a different light now, it seems. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=333.66s)]
*  Look, I get it. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=335.9s)]
*  It doesn't matter who he is at [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=338.78s)]
*  a private dinner with a comedian, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=340.7s)]
*  it matters who he is on [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=342.86s)]
*  the world stage. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=344.06s)]
*  I'm just talking, it's a positive [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=344.96s)]
*  that this person exists because [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=347.64s)]
*  everything I've ever not liked [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=350.0s)]
*  about him was I swear to God, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=352.32s)]
*  absent at least on this night with [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=354.64s)]
*  this guy. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=357.36s)]
*  Do you find this fascinating and [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=358.0s)]
*  a worthwhile observation, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=362.28s)]
*  tell all by Bill Maher, gang? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=366.0s)]
*  Do we need to know this? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=371.76s)]
*  Do we need to understand this side [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=374.62s)]
*  of Donald Trump? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=376.58000000000004s)]
*  Is that supposed to give us [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=377.74s)]
*  comfort or just I guess what's [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=378.98s)]
*  your takeaway? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=380.36s)]
*  Yeah, okay, so some mixed thoughts [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=381.42s)]
*  on it, but I get it and overall, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=384.06s)]
*  I'm in favor of it. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=386.42s)]
*  So number one, meeting with [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=387.58000000000004s)]
*  the president is not a problem at [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=389.5s)]
*  all. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=391.78000000000003s)]
*  I don't care who the president is. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=392.98s)]
*  If I have an opportunity to meet [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=394.54s)]
*  with the president, I will. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=395.62s)]
*  In fact, if he's on the opposing [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=396.66s)]
*  side, I might want to meet with [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=398.14s)]
*  him more. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=399.38s)]
*  Is there anything I could do that [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=400.14s)]
*  helps a little bit? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=402.06s)]
*  Sometimes people straw man and [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=403.56s)]
*  they go, my God, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=405.64000000000004s)]
*  if you meet with the president and [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=406.70000000000005s)]
*  he doesn't walk out a completely [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=408.68s)]
*  changed man, then it was worthless [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=410.48s)]
*  and it was a failure. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=412.46000000000004s)]
*  To get real, of course that's not [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=414.84000000000003s)]
*  going to happen, right? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=416.48s)]
*  But can you move him an inch and [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=417.68s)]
*  moving the president an inch is [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=419.32000000000005s)]
*  a big deal, right? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=421.0s)]
*  Can you get him to see a different [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=422.56s)]
*  perspective that he didn't see [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=424.28000000000003s)]
*  before? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=425.92s)]
*  Might that affect him down [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=426.44s)]
*  the road? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=427.76s)]
*  Those are all mites and stuff, but [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=428.28000000000003s)]
*  it's a lot better than not trying. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=430.48s)]
*  What do you gain if you don't go [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=433.26s)]
*  to the dinner? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=434.90000000000003s)]
*  Nothing, what do you try if you [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=436.62s)]
*  don't go to the dinner? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=438.22s)]
*  Nothing, I don't see how that [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=439.5s)]
*  helps. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=441.06s)]
*  So okay, then how did Bill do at [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=441.78000000000003s)]
*  the dinner? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=443.3s)]
*  Well, look, what he reported back [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=443.90000000000003s)]
*  is mixed news in there. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=446.22s)]
*  I don't particularly care if [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=448.66s)]
*  Donald Trump is nice behind [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=449.96000000000004s)]
*  the scenes. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=451.1s)]
*  Okay, great, God bless. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=451.74s)]
*  There is one part of that I do care [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=453.14s)]
*  about, which is that when you're [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=454.74s)]
*  with any Democratic leader, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=456.58s)]
*  it's true, you're always walking on [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=458.14s)]
*  eggshells. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=460.1s)]
*  Because ironically, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=461.1s)]
*  they have thinner skin than Trump. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=462.35999999999996s)]
*  If you're not constantly beseeching [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=464.76s)]
*  and enormously respectful and [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=467.2s)]

*  they're like, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=470.76s)]
*  are no decline. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=471.94s)]
*  The Democrats are obsessed with [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=473.28s)]
*  status, obsessed. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=475.32s)]
*  They're constantly looking at your [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=477.2s)]
*  social ranking, where do you have [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=479.28s)]
*  a title? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=481.23999999999995s)]
*  What kind of title? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=482.0s)]
*  Are you a donor? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=482.71999999999997s)]
*  What kind of donor, etc. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=483.55999999999995s)]
*  Whereas Trump's more like, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=485.15999999999997s)]
*  here's a guy in the room with me. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=486.73999999999995s)]
*  Okay, what do you got? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=488.28s)]
*  What do you think, right? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=489.47999999999996s)]
*  So that's better in my opinion. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=491.18s)]
*  Okay, well that's small, right? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=493.86s)]
*  But like, okay, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=496.22s)]
*  he was nice to you at the dinner or [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=497.18s)]
*  he's nice to me at a lunch or [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=499.02000000000004s)]
*  something. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=500.62s)]
*  I don't care at all. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=501.5s)]
*  That doesn't affect the voters. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=502.54s)]
*  And it doesn't affect what I think [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=504.58000000000004s)]
*  of Donald Trump, because what I care [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=506.34000000000003s)]
*  about is how he acts as president. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=508.08000000000004s)]
*  And to be fair to Maher, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=509.98s)]
*  he's pointing out, yeah, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=511.22s)]
*  when he's in public, he's a madman. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=512.58s)]
*  And he is. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=514.26s)]
*  So is it an act? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=515.5s)]
*  Is it better if it's an act? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=518.34s)]
*  Is it worse if it's an act? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=520.0799999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=521.68s)]
*  All I care about is, yes, but [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=522.28s)]
*  what does he do, right? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=524.16s)]
*  And what he does as president so [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=525.7199999999999s)]
*  far is totally unhinged. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=527.7199999999999s)]
*  Talking about sending now American [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=529.9599999999999s)]
*  citizens to a dungeon in [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=531.92s)]
*  El Salvador from time to time not [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=533.16s)]
*  listening to the courts is madness, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=534.88s)]
*  right? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=536.88s)]
*  So then, okay, now we get to [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=537.88s)]
*  the final and most important part. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=539.0799999999999s)]
*  Did Bill do any good there in some [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=540.52s)]
*  of the things that he brought up? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=542.3599999999999s)]
*  And I would argue yes. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=544.1999999999999s)]
*  So he brought up several things and [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=545.88s)]
*  a couple I was surprised by. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=548.3s)]
*  And so the fact that he plugged [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=550.5s)]
*  Obama's Iran deal, that's awesome. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=552.98s)]
*  He's absolutely right about that. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=556.4599999999999s)]
*  It takes courage to say, hey, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=561.18s)]
*  the deal that you got us out of was [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=562.86s)]
*  a terrific deal. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=564.78s)]
*  You should put us back into that [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=566.02s)]
*  deal. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=567.6999999999999s)]
*  So that's speaking truth to power, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=568.3s)]
*  right? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=570.18s)]
*  And by the way, that means that [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=570.8199999999999s)]
*  Maher is not in favor of attacking [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=572.78s)]
*  Iran, which is what Israel wants. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=574.98s)]
*  And he told Trump that. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=577.68s)]
*  And Trump views him as the Israel [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=580.28s)]
*  guy, because he is. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=581.88s)]
*  And here's somebody that he views [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=583.16s)]
*  to be on his side on that issue [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=585.04s)]
*  going, don't attack Iran. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=586.6s)]
*  I'll take it. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=588.8399999999999s)]
*  I'll definitely take that, right? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=589.64s)]
*  And he even criticizes Gaza policy. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=591.64s)]
*  Wow, I'll definitely take that, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=593.64s)]
*  right? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=595.88s)]
*  So again, guys, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=596.64s)]
*  don't be unrealistic. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=597.88s)]
*  Bill told him at a dinner, so [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=600.0s)]
*  Donald Trump is not going to go [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=601.64s)]
*  back into the Obama deal on Iran? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=603.4s)]
*  No, of course not. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=605.56s)]
*  I don't expect that. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=606.78s)]
*  Bill Maher doesn't expect that. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=607.5s)]
*  But is it an extra voice against [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=609.22s)]
*  the war with Iran? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=611.46s)]
*  And is that a good thing? [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=613.38s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=614.54s)]
*  Hopefully more and [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=616.06s)]
*  more of those voices will add up. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=617.02s)]
*  So Sharon, when I look at it [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=618.98s)]
*  overall, I think, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=620.58s)]
*  I don't think it's world changing, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=621.66s)]
*  but I think it was a good effort, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=623.58s)]
*  and it probably did some good. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=625.26s)]
*  That's my take on it. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=626.8199999999999s)]
*  What's your take on it? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=628.22s)]
*  I agree with you. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=630.18s)]
*  I wouldn't have an issue with you [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=631.62s)]
*  going in there and coming out and [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=633.9399999999999s)]
*  giving your honest assessment. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=636.26s)]
*  And I'm not suggesting that Bill [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=638.68s)]
*  Maher wasn't genuine or [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=640.8199999999999s)]
*  completely honest. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=642.36s)]
*  But I guess one thing that I'm [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=643.8s)]
*  thinking about, and again, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=645.28s)]
*  I agree with you. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=646.68s)]
*  But Donald Trump is a, some would [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=647.36s)]
*  say con artist, but let's just call [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=649.96s)]
*  him an artist of personalities. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=652.8s)]
*  And he knows that when he invites [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=656.4s)]
*  you over how to butter you up and [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=658.4s)]
*  make you feel so good and [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=660.4s)]
*  pretend that he's listening. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=661.98s)]
*  And maybe he is, okay? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=664.08s)]
*  You know the last person in [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=665.54s)]
*  the room can usually have some [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=666.98s)]
*  effect on him. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=668.5799999999999s)]
*  But I wonder what you think about [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=669.38s)]
*  someone going in there with Trump's [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=671.78s)]
*  agenda is let me play this guy [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=674.4399999999999s)]
*  enough so that he'll go normalize [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=676.62s)]
*  me to his following, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=679.18s)]
*  which is significant. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=680.72s)]
*  And so I wonder how you feel about [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=682.5799999999999s)]
*  that. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=684.86s)]
*  And again, I'm not saying that that [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=685.46s)]
*  happened or Bill Maher is stupid or [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=687.66s)]
*  gullible. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=689.86s)]
*  But when Donald Trump wants [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=691.46s)]
*  an audience with you, even if he [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=693.22s)]
*  even if Kid Rock set it up, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=695.3199999999999s)]
*  you know he hates his guts. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=697.0s)]
*  I think you feel like a chosen one [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=698.56s)]
*  and that's the human nature. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=700.8s)]
*  So I don't know, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=702.9599999999999s)]
*  I just wonder about that part. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=704.0799999999999s)]
*  By and large, I agree, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=706.1999999999999s)]
*  I would go sit down. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=707.5999999999999s)]
*  I would, okay, and [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=709.28s)]
*  I probably would listen and [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=710.16s)]
*  I'd have some openness, yes. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=711.52s)]
*  But I just wonder about that part. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=713.24s)]
*  Yeah, so actually in our live chat [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=716.0799999999999s)]
*  poll, you know the show's live [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=717.8s)]
*  Monday to Friday, starts at 6 o'clock [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=719.3599999999999s)]
*  Eastern, goes to 8 o'clock. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=721.16s)]
*  And then we have an extra bonus [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=722.7199999999999s)]
*  episode for members. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=723.92s)]
*  I'm going to quote another member [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=724.6999999999999s)]
*  in a second. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=726.18s)]
*  But in the live chat we asked, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=726.7399999999999s)]
*  do you think Bill Maher will be [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=728.54s)]
*  softer on Trump now? [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=730.2199999999999s)]
*  So that's kind of a post question, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=731.4599999999999s)]
*  right? [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=733.54s)]
*  After the dinner, that's the issue [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=734.14s)]
*  that Sharon just brought up. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=736.3399999999999s)]
*  My issue was how did the dinner go? [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=738.3399999999999s)]
*  Did it help in any way, shape, or [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=740.42s)]
*  form? [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=742.02s)]
*  The secondary thing is now Maher [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=742.54s)]
*  going to lean more towards Trump, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=744.9s)]
*  etc. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=747.2399999999999s)]
*  And 79% of you think that he will. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=747.8199999999999s)]
*  I'm going to go on a limb here and [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=750.14s)]
*  I am on a limb. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=752.2199999999999s)]
*  I'm here and [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=753.4s)]
*  I am on a limb on this one, but [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=754.0s)]
*  I'm going to say no, [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=755.6s)]
*  I don't think he will. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=756.68s)]
*  And so, and I say that as a guy who [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=757.96s)]
*  was heavily criticized Bill Maher, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=760.72s)]
*  right? [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=763.72s)]
*  And so, but he read a list, so [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=765.12s)]
*  why do I say that? [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=767.32s)]
*  He read a list of the things that [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=768.56s)]
*  he already agreed with Trump on, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=770.72s)]
*  including tightening up the border. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=773.1s)]
*  And he said, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=775.92s)]
*  he'll be going a little too far on [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=776.52s)]
*  DEI and a couple other things. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=778.24s)]
*  And as you read that list, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=780.68s)]
*  there was one or two things that I [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=781.64s)]
*  disagreed with. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=782.9s)]
*  But overall, I was like, yeah, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=784.22s)]
*  that is what Bill Maher has been [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=785.58s)]
*  saying and I largely agree with [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=786.82s)]
*  Bill Maher on those things. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=788.26s)]
*  I disagree on others. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=789.9s)]
*  And so, do I think that he'll go, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=792.14s)]
*  was that his real list that he [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=794.18s)]
*  already agreed with Trump on? [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=795.9399999999999s)]
*  Yes, I've seen him say those [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=798.06s)]
*  things, right? [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=799.26s)]
*  Do I think he'll go further than [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=800.74s)]
*  that, give Trump a bigger break [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=802.46s)]
*  going forward? [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=804.06s)]
*  I can't believe I'm going to trust [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=806.58s)]
*  Maher on this, but no, but [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=809.06s)]
*  I do believe it. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=811.02s)]
*  Look, for those opinions of his [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=811.92s)]
*  that drive me crazy, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=813.6999999999999s)]
*  they are his real opinions, right? [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=814.86s)]
*  And so he's not faking that and [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=817.24s)]
*  I haven't seen him fake things [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=819.34s)]
*  before. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=821.52s)]
*  And he is at a point where he's [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=823.28s)]
*  like, look, I have enough money, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=825.0799999999999s)]
*  I have enough fame, how does it [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=827.0799999999999s)]
*  help me to kiss Trump's ass, right? [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=828.9599999999999s)]
*  So, but if it turns out he's much [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=831.4s)]
*  softer on Trump, then I'll come [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=833.8s)]
*  back and tell you and say, hey, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=836.16s)]
*  I screwed that one up, right? [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=838.4s)]
*  But okay, for now, I think that [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=840.42s)]
*  Maher won't and [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=842.5799999999999s)]
*  I'm in the minority on that. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=843.4599999999999s)]
*  So last thing here is from one of [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=845.4599999999999s)]
*  our members, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=846.9399999999999s)]
*  Eclectic Miscellania, right? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=847.54s)]
*  By the way, you can be a member by [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=849.18s)]
*  hitting the join button below if [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=850.66s)]
*  you're watching on YouTube or [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=852.16s)]
*  tyt.com slash join to, and [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=853.5799999999999s)]
*  Eclectics from tyt.com. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=855.1s)]
*  So anyway, he wrote in, maybe Jen [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=856.62s)]
*  could have a productive [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=858.42s)]
*  conversation with Trump because he [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=859.66s)]
*  would go into the conversation [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=861.38s)]
*  trying to accomplish something [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=862.8199999999999s)]
*  important. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=864.26s)]
*  There's no way that Bill Maher went [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=864.8199999999999s)]
*  into that dinner thinking he would [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=866.22s)]
*  accomplish anything other than [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=867.66s)]
*  inflating his already outsized ego. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=869.04s)]
*  So Eclectic, that I can't get too [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=871.76s)]
*  deep into Maher's psyche and [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=874.52s)]
*  psychoanalyze him on that. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=876.84s)]
*  But I hear what you're saying, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=879.1999999999999s)]
*  given the past, and [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=881.04s)]
*  I appreciate your compliment about [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=882.12s)]
*  me, but the reason I read that is [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=884.1999999999999s)]
*  because he's right in that if I had [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=886.12s)]
*  the dinner with Trump, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=888.42s)]
*  I would go in with a plan. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=890.12s)]
*  And the plan would be how do I get [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=891.84s)]
*  one of our priorities passed? [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=894.0799999999999s)]
*  Because everything else is just [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=896.4399999999999s)]
*  fun and games except actual action, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=898.58s)]
*  bills that pass, or in Trump's case, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=900.78s)]
*  executive orders, etc, right? [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=902.98s)]
*  So I think Maher did some good by [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=904.82s)]
*  pushing, getting back into the Iran [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=906.78s)]
*  peace deal and not going to war. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=908.98s)]
*  Could you have done more good if you [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=910.86s)]
*  made a pitch for paid family leave, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=913.1800000000001s)]
*  one that he might be able to [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=915.46s)]
*  understand and actually go for? [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=917.1800000000001s)]
*  Well, no, you wouldn't. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=919.34s)]
*  Would you have over a 50% chance on [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=920.86s)]
*  that? [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=923.14s)]
*  No, but will I take a 20% chance on [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=923.7s)]
*  passing a bill that I'm not [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=925.9s)]
*  passing, I'm passing paid family [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=928.0s)]
*  leave under any administration? [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=930.2s)]
*  Yes, and so if you say, hey, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=932.32s)]
*  that's naive, you'll never go for [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=933.84s)]
*  it, well, I'd rather have a 20% [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=935.52s)]
*  chance than a 0% chance. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=937.24s)]
*  So I wish others in media cared as [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=938.6s)]
*  much about actual legislation and [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=941.0s)]
*  policy and really had a plan to be [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=943.4s)]
*  able to effectuate that in a [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=945.64s)]
*  Democratic administration or [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=947.52s)]
*  Republican administration, but [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=949.6800000000001s)]
*  that's probably asking for too much. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=952.04s)]
*  So overall, juries out on this [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=954.44s)]
*  dinner so far, but [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=956.24s)]
*  I like the idea and let's see if [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=957.38s)]
*  you guys are right or [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=959.46s)]
*  I'm right on what Bill does next. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=960.78s)]
*  I think he would have gone in there [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=964.34s)]
*  and I actually think it would have [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=965.66s)]
*  done something. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=967.1s)]
*  I think he would have said, [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=967.74s)]
*  you know what, because Dana White [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=968.9s)]
*  can rock and care, but he would have [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=970.38s)]
*  said write something up for me and [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=971.98s)]
*  I'll consider it. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=973.5s)]
*  I actually think he might have been [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=974.42s)]
*  able to do something, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=975.86s)]
*  maybe he'll invite you next. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=976.78s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=978.26s)]
*  an angel gets his wings. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=979.86s)]
*  Totally not true, but [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=981.38s)]
*  it does keep you updated on [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=982.4200000000001s)]
*  our live shows. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhTyzTa9Ag&t=983.66s)]
