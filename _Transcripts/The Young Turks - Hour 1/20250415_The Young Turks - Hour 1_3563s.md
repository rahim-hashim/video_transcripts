# Courting A Crisis - April 14, 2025
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [April 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww)
*  There are some problems here. Sorry big time. I'm so upset [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=0.0s)]
*  All right, welcome to Young Turks. Cenk Uygur, Sharon Reed with you guys. Sharon's of course [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=30.0s)]
*  One of the stars of Rebel HQ. Check that out on YouTube. So big show ahead, Sharon, as you know, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=55.24s)]
*  we've got Trump threatening to send US citizens now to El Salvador. We'll tell you the context of that [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=63.96s)]
*  and are we going to get the innocent guy back? Well, the president of El Salvador was here. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=71.88s)]
*  We'll see what kind of progress we made on that, if any. Democrats hiding in shame if they're in [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=77.16s)]
*  the room with Donald Trump, although Bill Maher doing the exact opposite. So there's a lot of [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=82.68s)]
*  interesting drama in there today, including in the markets and what in the world we're going to do [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=88.60000000000001s)]
*  with tariffs, it seems to change about twice a day. So Sharon, take it away. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=96.44000000000001s)]
*  Just twice a day, it seems like more. It seems like more. Okay, we'll begin with messaging mayhem, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=101.16000000000001s)]
*  Cenk. Last Friday, Trump administration announced a number of electronics now, including, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=109.32000000000001s)]
*  but not limited to computers, smartphones would be exempt for most of the steep tariffs imposed [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=115.64s)]
*  on China. But on Sunday, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick clarified that those exemptions [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=122.44s)]
*  are only temporary and those products will be getting hit with a new tariff soon. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=129.48000000000002s)]
*  Let's watch Lutnick go back and forth with a baffled Jonathan Karl. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=135.0s)]
*  Let's start with that news late Friday, that this exemption on electronics, smartphones, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=141.8s)]
*  laptop computers and the like. What's the thinking? Why the exemption? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=148.44s)]
*  Well, if you remember, over the past couple of months, President Trump has called out [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=153.8s)]
*  pharmaceuticals and semiconductors and autos. He called them sector tariffs and those are not [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=159.64s)]
*  available for negotiation. They are just going to be part of making sure we reassure the core [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=167.0s)]
*  national security items that need to be made in this country. We need to make medicine in this [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=174.27999999999997s)]
*  country. Wait a minute, I'm asking you about the exemption, not about, I mean, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=179.72s)]
*  the notice that went out Friday night saying that electronics, a wide range of electronics, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=185.48s)]
*  including smartphones, including components used to make microchips, that these are now exempt [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=190.2s)]
*  from the reciprocal tariffs. Why that move? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=198.2s)]
*  Well, remember those products are going to be part of the semiconductor [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=204.04s)]
*  sectoral tariffs which are coming. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=209.4s)]
*  So you're saying that the big tariffs on things like smartphones and laptops, iPhones, all those [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=211.56s)]
*  iPhones built in China, that those tariffs are temporarily off but they're going to be [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=219.96s)]
*  coming right back on in another form in a month or so? Or what are you saying? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=225.88s)]
*  Correct. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=230.68s)]
*  There's a lot more to this one, but Cenk, I guess, take us through that clip, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=234.84s)]
*  your initial thoughts on, I guess dissect it for us. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=239.48s)]
*  Yeah, so first we had global tariffs and they were definitely going to stick with those because that [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=243.56s)]
*  was going to rebuild manufacturing in America. Then, okay, yeah, well, the stock market and [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=248.6s)]
*  the bond market crashes, so that was really inconvenient. So we got nothing in return [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=253.07999999999998s)]
*  for concession that they're not going to be global tariffs. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=257.64s)]
*  It's just going to be, yeah, some 10% kind of bare minimum stuff across the board, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=259.8s)]
*  but overall mainly just on China, 145% on China. Okay, so ladies and gentlemen, we got them trying, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=267.15999999999997s)]
*  those are definitely going to stay because we're rebuilding our manufacturing base here in America, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=273.08s)]
*  okay? And we're going to do it against the Chinese. Okay, fine, they're not going to stay, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=278.52s)]
*  they're not. We're going to exempt electronics. So a lot of things you buy from China like your [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=283.0s)]
*  iPhones and things that are critical here in America. So we blinked, no, we're not going to [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=289.24s)]
*  do 145% tariff on those. So oops, that's the second giant concession with absolutely nothing [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=295.88s)]
*  in return. But wait, we're not done yet confusing you because now, a lot of niggas say, what, yeah, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=303.08s)]
*  now look, those tariffs are exempt, the iPhones, etc. from China. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=311.32s)]
*  But they're sectoral tariffs, which we have not yet heard of, and they will be reapplied at a later [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=319.64s)]
*  date. What on God's green earth are you talking about? This is such a giant mess. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=327.48s)]
*  Meanwhile, contradicted by other administration staffers at the same time. Guys, fish rots from [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=335.64000000000004s)]
*  the head down. How many times have we told you here? Donald Trump has no earthly idea what he's [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=342.28000000000003s)]
*  doing. There is no grand strategy, there is no art of the deal. He just throws stuff against the [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=348.36s)]
*  wall and see what sticks. So he's like global tariffs on the stick, 145% tariffs on China, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=353.88s)]
*  that didn't stick. Exemptions, well, that's well, sectoral tariffs. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=360.36s)]
*  What is this? So every business person in the country is like, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=366.12s)]
*  Jesus Christ, man, what are you doing? So should I manufacture here or should not? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=372.28000000000003s)]
*  Should I import or should not? Do I still have a business or don't I? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=377.96000000000004s)]
*  I don't know, tune in tomorrow, he'll change his mind three more times. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=381.48s)]
*  So, Sharon, as we give you the rest of the story here and we talked this through, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=385.15999999999997s)]
*  one of the important things is, what are we trying to accomplish? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=390.68s)]
*  How is it going to help the average American? And this is super important, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=397.08s)]
*  what's going to happen next? Cuz I have a pretty good idea what's gonna happen next, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=401.0s)]
*  and it ain't pretty. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=404.91999999999996s)]
*  Well, he said he's fine with recession, Cenk, remember, just not depression. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=407.4s)]
*  So just buckle up. And if you thought that was confusing, there's more where that came from. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=411.32s)]
*  Let's listen to this exchange between Peter Navarro and Kristen Welker. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=418.92s)]
*  There's three kinds, there's the high-end chips, which is the AI future. Okay, we've got to get [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=425.0s)]
*  control of that. And then there's everything else that fuels our autos and on down. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=430.12s)]
*  Fair enough, I hear what you're saying on investigation, but there is currently an [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=435.24s)]
*  exclusion for some of those products. You wanna call it exclusion, potatoes, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=439.24s)]
*  potatoes, what it is. The White House called it an exclusion. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=443.88s)]
*  But let's say, here's I think another thing that's really important. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=446.76s)]
*  When people talk about the chaos or lack of trade, whatever, you just go back to day one. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=452.6s)]
*  I was there when the president signed it. It was the second to last order he signed, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=457.64s)]
*  it was in the over, that night. And it was the America First Trade Policy, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=461.48s)]
*  which laid out every single thing we're doing. And it would be remiss for anybody in the media, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=466.44s)]
*  not to review that carefully and see that there's rhyme to a reason and rhythm to what we're doing. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=472.68s)]
*  Why do they agree to go on these shows? From US Customs and Border Protection, listen to this. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=478.76s)]
*  All products that are properly classified in these listed provisions will be excluded from [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=488.36s)]
*  the reciprocal tariffs imposed under Executive Order 14257. So you have that. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=493.96s)]
*  Also took up Navarro's challenge to check out the America First Trade Policy. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=501.15999999999997s)]
*  He directed us there. It is pretty long, but to sum it up briefly, it calls on the Trump [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=506.59999999999997s)]
*  administration to investigate trade deficits with other countries, especially China, and create a new [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=512.76s)]
*  trade policy, okay? So they're all over this and the devil's in the details. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=518.84s)]
*  A new trade policy that promotes investment and productivity, enhances our nation's industrial and [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=524.36s)]
*  technological advantages, defends our economic and national security, and above all, benefits [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=530.0400000000001s)]
*  American workers, manufacturers, farmers, ranchers, entrepreneurs, and businesses. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=536.0400000000001s)]
*  All the people who are hurting from the moment he pressed send on his new policy. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=541.7199999999999s)]
*  Tariff whiplash has gotten so out of control that even Kevin O'Leary, I mean, he loves Donald Trump. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=549.4s)]
*  He's fiercely defended Trump's tariffs, is now admitting Trump administration is not doing a good [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=555.64s)]
*  job of explaining their strategy. Watch this clip. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=560.52s)]
*  I know you think these. Tell me why. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=564.2s)]
*  I think we have a negotiation going on that's been detailed ad ad nauseam. It's a little chaotic [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=572.6800000000001s)]
*  from the point of view that you don't get a consistent message out of the administration. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=578.6s)]
*  I admit that's a problem. Ludnick says one thing, and then Burgum says another. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=583.5600000000001s)]
*  That's gotta get cleaned up and that's self-inflicted. They can fix that. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=589.88s)]
*  Now he doesn't exactly blame fish rots, okay? He doesn't blame Trump, but he's saying that [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=594.9200000000001s)]
*  they've got to clean up her act, Mr. Wonderful there. This morning on CNN, Harry Anton broke [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=601.4000000000001s)]
*  down a new poll that revealed Americans are feeling very worried about this economy, you think? [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=606.2s)]
*  I believe this is the worst poll that Donald Trump has received in his second term and we can go [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=611.5600000000001s)]
*  through it, Jessica. Let's talk about the economy, right? Think the economy is getting worse. Back in [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=617.88s)]
*  November, it was 42% of Americans. You don't have to be a genius to follow this timeline. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=622.6s)]
*  By February, it was 49%, March 51%. Look at where we are now, 53%. The clear majority of Americans [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=626.6800000000001s)]
*  think the economy is getting worse and that number is rising. We're more responsible for [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=633.5600000000001s)]
*  the state of the economy or the economic state. In March, CBS News asked about inflation and 38% [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=638.0400000000001s)]
*  said it was Joe Biden who was more responsible compared to 34% who said Donald Trump, let's jump [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=643.16s)]
*  forward to now in the month of April. Look at this number, 54% of Americans say that Donald [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=648.12s)]
*  Trump is more to blame for the state of the economy than Joe Biden. New tariffs on important [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=655.32s)]
*  goods, oppose versus favor. You go back to January, look at this, 48% said they favored [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=660.28s)]
*  these new tariffs, these Donald Trump tariffs compared to 46% who oppose. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=667.0s)]
*  Look at where we are now in the CBS News, YouGov poll, a switcheroo, Jessica, a switcheroo. The [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=671.08s)]
*  clear majority, 58% of Americans oppose these new tariffs compared to just 42% who favor him. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=676.28s)]
*  He hasn't been in office that long and he's been talking about Joe Biden day in and day out and [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=684.76s)]
*  how he's blaming Joe Biden for everything. And still these are the numbers. It's hard to feel [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=691.72s)]
*  great about the economy, of course, with all this happening in, well, just the last week alone. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=696.04s)]
*  It's like we said, whiplash, folks, it is that much. Just look at it. One week and here we have it, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=701.0s)]
*  okay? Universal reciprocal tariffs, a removal back down to 10%. 50% Chinese tariffs, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=710.0400000000001s)]
*  90% Chinese tariffs, 104% Chinese tariffs, 125% Chinese tariffs, 145 Chinese tariffs. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=716.52s)]
*  Electronics exempted, electronics now potentially back on. So again, I ask you, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=726.2s)]
*  Jen, why do they even bother to go on the shows except it's getting out their fake messaging, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=734.9200000000001s)]
*  but perhaps just go on true social for that? It's just comical if it didn't hurt so much, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=741.4000000000001s)]
*  if it wasn't so painful. There is no rhyme or reason to this, except perhaps bullying and then [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=747.5600000000001s)]
*  showing that you have all the chess moves. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=754.6s)]
*  You can make all this chaos happen. I mean, what is it? [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=756.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so there's two different things there. So one is how much they do media and two is how they [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=759.32s)]
*  do the media. So in terms of how much media they do, I actually agree with them. Media is how you [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=765.88s)]
*  get your message out and they should be doing it over and over and over again. Democrats don't do [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=772.76s)]
*  it nearly enough. So sending out a bunch of cabinet officials to send your message out, I get it. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=776.52s)]
*  For example, Stephen Miller and Caroline Lemmon are all over TV pretending that the Supreme Court [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=781.88s)]
*  ruled nine to nothing in their favor when they actually ruled nine to nothing against them. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=787.64s)]
*  But they're saying it so much, the right wing media is picking it up and now they've convinced [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=792.36s)]
*  at least half the right wing that the Supreme Court ruled with the Trump administration [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=797.56s)]
*  instead of against the Trump administration. So that's the power propaganda and you use media [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=801.88s)]
*  to do it. So to me, that's not the issue. The issue is if you're a competent administration, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=806.28s)]
*  and again, if you're in the right wing, you should be more mad at them than I am [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=811.88s)]
*  because they're not doing this in any way that helps your cause. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=816.12s)]
*  What you would do is, hey, these cabinet officials are going to go on or other advisors are going to [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=820.04s)]
*  go on TV this weekend. So before you all go on, let's get on a call and figure out what our message [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=826.12s)]
*  is and be sure that we're clear because especially because the president doesn't know what the hell [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=831.16s)]
*  he's doing and changes his mind every other. I was gonna say every other day, but really, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=835.08s)]
*  as we said earlier, about twice a day, right? So if I was a Trump guy and I was gonna go on TV, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=839.72s)]
*  I would call Suzy Wiles, the chief of staff and say, tell me exactly where we are right now, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=846.44s)]
*  right? And then I'd ask her, now what's the percentage chance that Trump's gonna change [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=852.44s)]
*  in the next four hours, six hours, etc., right? But the bottom line is I'd have a battle plan [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=856.76s)]
*  for my side and to get my message out. And it's super obvious from the tape, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=862.68s)]
*  you can see with your own eyes, they don't have a battle plan. They're not coordinating, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=866.8399999999999s)]
*  and they're saying different things, which by the way, every thing that the Trump administration [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=871.0799999999999s)]
*  says affects the markets, because then the markets are like, it trades back on. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=876.4399999999999s)]
*  No, the tariffs are back on, this, that, those things. And it's moving the markets in so many [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=881.4799999999999s)]
*  different ways, and it's affecting people's ability to plan. That's what I was referring [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=886.4399999999999s)]
*  to earlier. So a lot of the business in this country overhype their need for stability. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=890.68s)]
*  If you ever tweak anything in the government, they're like, no, no, no, we must protect the [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=895.56s)]
*  status quo. We need stability. So 90% of the time, that's just an excuse, right? But [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=899.3199999999999s)]
*  they base it on a kernel of truth. It's true that businesses need some degree of stability to be [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=905.8s)]
*  able to plan. Are there huge imports, small imports, I'm sorry, huge tariffs, no tariffs, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=909.8s)]
*  or some tariffs, so I can know, do I build, do I bring in products? [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=915.4000000000001s)]
*  How do I plan for the rest of my year and the rest of the next couple of years? This is very [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=919.5600000000001s)]
*  normal in the business world, right? So now they can't do any planning, because every time they [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=925.48s)]
*  make a plan, then Trump changes it, and then changes it again, and changes it again. So now [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=930.0400000000001s)]
*  everything's going haywire. Not only is Trump changing it, everyone from the Trump team is [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=934.44s)]
*  saying something different on TV. So everybody's, including their supporters like Kevin O'Leary, [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=938.5200000000001s)]
*  are just throwing up their hands and their cameras apparently. That's why a quarter of [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=943.32s)]
*  his face was showing, and saying like, I don't know what's going on here. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=946.5200000000001s)]
*  How could you possibly know? So yeah, this is super disorganized. Why? Trump never plans anything. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=951.5600000000001s)]
*  If I was gonna do tariffs, I'd have a plan A, a plan B, a plan C. Plan B would be, hey, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=961.0s)]
*  what if the markets go south? How long are we going to let them go south? [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=967.1600000000001s)]
*  Is there a number at which we say, hey, wait, this has gone too far? How long do we plan to do X, [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=971.64s)]
*  Y, or Z? But they haven't planned any of that, any of it. It is, as usual, deep incompetence, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=976.92s)]
*  because the president is super lazy, and he thinks he's a genius. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=984.28s)]
*  So he just flies off the handle. Yeah, tariffs against China, 104%. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=989.48s)]
*  125%, 145%. Come on, man, Jesus Christ. So you don't have to be left-wing to see [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=994.44s)]
*  that looks like a clown move, one after another after another. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1007.0s)]
*  So finally, this is the most important part. What's gonna happen in the future? [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1010.84s)]
*  So I'm gonna read one of our members comments here. He's from Canada, but is this is soon [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1013.6400000000001s)]
*  gonna apply to America as well. He said, yeah, the tariffs finally affected me. I live in a small [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1017.4000000000001s)]
*  community in Canada, and I have to look for new employment because my employer lost some contracts [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1021.88s)]
*  due to delays attributed to tariffs. So, okay, so that happens to be in Canada, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1026.76s)]
*  but that's gonna happen all over America, because the same exact phenomenon. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1031.96s)]
*  The employers don't know, do I hire, do I fire? Do I have enough money to hire people? Do I have [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1036.04s)]
*  enough money to keep people? The first immediate problem with the stock market turning down is not [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1041.24s)]
*  how it affects rich people or corporations. It's how it affects your 401k. Okay, so we got that. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1046.6s)]
*  But depending on the situation, we can get past that, right? The second way that it affects people [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1052.0400000000002s)]
*  is if it goes dramatically down, then businesses start to tighten up and they stop hiring and they [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1056.0400000000002s)]
*  start firing, right? So that's what's coming next. And then the third thing that happens is that [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1062.52s)]
*  because they now have this huge cost added on top, they're going to start increasing prices. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1069.0800000000002s)]
*  Now, because he pulled a lot of the tariffs back, it won't be as universal as it was. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1074.8400000000001s)]
*  But still, these are some significant tariffs on plenty of places. So you're not gonna see [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1079.0s)]
*  all of your prices going up, but now you're gonna see prices pop one after another after another in [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1084.6s)]
*  places you don't expect. You go to buy a car, now the car costs 20% more. What the hell? What just [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1089.64s)]
*  happened, etc, etc? And you know what that's going to do? That's gonna drive his poll numbers way down. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1094.92s)]
*  Because those numbers that Enten showed are before people have actually started to get affected in [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1101.56s)]
*  their personal lives. Once they start getting affected, they're gonna be mad. What was the [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1107.32s)]
*  number one reason they elected Trump? Because of inflation. And what did he just do? He just poured [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1114.2s)]
*  an enormous amount of fuel on that fire. You know what Trump's like with the tariffs and inflation? [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1120.12s)]
*  He's like that scene in Zoolander where they're spraying each other with gasoline, right? Like, [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1127.08s)]
*  woohoo! And then somebody lights a match. And as Trump said about the markets, [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1132.44s)]
*  they're gonna go boom, just not boom in the direction that he was hoping for. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1138.68s)]
*  So next will be rage. And then Trump will backpedal because he hates having low numbers. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1143.3200000000002s)]
*  And he will have disastrously low numbers. And then we'll have another round of uncertainty [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1150.2s)]
*  in what's gonna happen next. But here's what's not going to happen. We're not going to rebuild [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1155.48s)]
*  manufacturing with clown ass tariffs like this. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1159.72s)]
*  No, and back to the messaging. I mean, I get it. What you said makes perfect sense. But I will [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1162.3600000000001s)]
*  say this. How do you plan for anything? I'd love to declare everybody around him incompetent. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1168.92s)]
*  But how can you, even Susie, how can you plan for anything when the man at the top seems so emotional [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1173.56s)]
*  and reactionary and somewhat unhinged? Sometimes it seems like some of these people are on the air, [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1180.44s)]
*  Navarro, whoever else. And he's literally tweeted something that's making for breaking news that [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1187.72s)]
*  they can't even keep up with. It's asinine. Yeah, I think that's an app description of it, [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1193.16s)]
*  for sure. And just to be super clear, yeah, I actually blame Lutnick and Navarro, [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1200.68s)]
*  etc., a lot less than I blame Trump. Because Navarro's pushing his agenda, [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1207.32s)]
*  and I hate his agenda. And he's one of these guys that's just so over the top on tariffs. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1212.68s)]
*  And I think it does the cause of tariffs actually more harm than good. So I got no love for any of [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1218.76s)]
*  these guys. But like you mentioned, Susie Wiles, Chief of Staff, she's perfectly competent. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1223.6399999999999s)]
*  She's shown that she's competent and gotten Trump under control when she needed to on a number of [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1228.84s)]
*  occasions. And we've shared that on the show. But even Susie Wiles can't wrangle the most [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1235.0s)]
*  unranglable guy on Earth. Because you're absolutely right, Trump won't ever listen to reason. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1240.4399999999998s)]
*  And now that he's gotten elected again, he thinks he's a demigod. He thinks he doesn't need anyone [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1245.8799999999999s)]
*  else. And he thinks he's like some sort of supernova genius, because he passes dementia tests. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1250.9199999999998s)]
*  And so that's why he just lashes out. And no one can correct him, because his skin is so thin. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1255.8799999999999s)]
*  He's so deeply insecure that no one can say, hey, Mr. President, it might not be a great idea to [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1263.1599999999999s)]
*  change the tariffs on China literally six times in a row within a span of about three days. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1269.88s)]
*  Maybe we need a little bit more stability. If any of them actually suggested that, [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1277.64s)]
*  you're like, what are you talking about? You're terrible, you're fired. I'm very disappointed in [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1281.5600000000002s)]
*  my commerce, Secretary. And then he goes, sends them on air. And then when they make clowns of [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1285.96s)]
*  themselves because Trump told them to, he goes, I'm very disappointed. Right? So there's no winning [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1290.7600000000002s)]
*  with this guy. How about this guy, Bill Maher? Bill Maher? He's an interesting guy. People [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1296.52s)]
*  originally thought, boy, he's so far left. And then they thought, no, he's somewhere in the middle. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1309.0s)]
*  He's just a sensible guy. And now it's just all over the place. Take a look at this. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1314.44s)]
*  We came to dinner with me, Bill, Dana White, and it could not have been better. Everyone was so [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1319.5600000000002s)]
*  surprised, so pleasant. How about this? President Trump, extending this olive branch and we talked [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1327.48s)]
*  about things we had in common, ending wokeness, securing the border. The president was asking him [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1333.5600000000002s)]
*  what he thought about policy going on with Iran and Israel and things. It just blew my mind. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1340.52s)]
*  I was very, very proud. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1347.48s)]
*  I think it takes so little to blow someone's ego up, especially when they already had one to [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1351.96s)]
*  begin with. Maybe that's what's going on here. Last month, mega superstar Kid Rock facilitated [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1356.8400000000001s)]
*  a dinner between himself, UFC President Dana White, President Donald Trump, and avid Trump critic, [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1362.76s)]
*  Bill Maher. Interesting dinner conversation, perhaps. Apparently, it went better than expected. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1371.08s)]
*  Cenk, before we get into the details about the dinner, I wonder what they serve. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1378.68s)]
*  What were your initial thoughts, your reactions when you heard about [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1385.0s)]
*  Bill Maher getting invited to the White House? [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1389.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but I think it makes perfect sense. If I was Bill Maher, I'd go. I'll defend him all the way [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1393.16s)]
*  ongoing. Of course, what happened at the dinner is relevant. So let's find out what happened and then [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1398.52s)]
*  judge that as well. Okay, let's do it. While the dinner was two weeks ago at this point, [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1404.1200000000001s)]
*  Bill Maher opened up about the experience on this past Friday's episode of Real Time with Bill Maher. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1412.28s)]
*  And he laid everything out on the table for his audience, transparency, if you will. As you know, [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1417.56s)]
*  12 days ago, I had dinner with President Trump, a dinner that had been set up by my friend Kid Rock, [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1423.6399999999999s)]
*  because we share a belief that there's got to be something better than hurling insults from [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1429.48s)]
*  3,000 miles away. Let me first say that to all the people who treated this like it was some kind of [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1433.6399999999999s)]
*  summit meeting, you're ridiculous. Like I was going to sign a treaty or something. I have no power. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1439.96s)]
*  I'm an effing comedian. And he's the most powerful leader in the world. I'm not the leader of anything [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1445.08s)]
*  except maybe a contingent of centrist minded people who think there's got to be a better way [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1450.28s)]
*  of running this country than hating each other every minute. So how did the dinner go? Well, [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1455.6399999999999s)]
*  off the bat, this dinner could have gone very badly. Seen as Maher brought a list of at least [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1461.72s)]
*  60 names Trump has called him in the past. So can you imagine? I don't know that that would [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1470.6s)]
*  even embarrass Donald Trump, but Trump was a good sport about it, apparently, signing it and having [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1476.2s)]
*  a grand old time. So they got along, the amluss of jokes, levity. Just for starters, he laughs. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1482.76s)]
*  I've never seen him laugh in public, but he does, including at himself. And it's not fake, believe [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1489.56s)]
*  me. As a comedian of 40 years, I know a fake laugh when I hear it. I never felt I had to walk on [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1497.16s)]
*  eggshells around him. And honestly, I voted for Clinton and Obama, but I would never feel [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1503.08s)]
*  comfortable talking to them. The way I was able to talk with Donald Trump, that's just how it went [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1508.6s)]
*  down. Make it what you will. It's emblematic of why the Democrats are so unpopular these days. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1514.04s)]
*  So the personalities, he vibes with one over perhaps the others. Stereotyping, but perhaps [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1523.56s)]
*  living up to it. Wasn't all jokes and laughter. They also touched on some serious subjects and [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1531.08s)]
*  pressing issues, which he did challenge President Trump on, according to Marr. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1536.36s)]
*  There were so many moments when, well, I hit him with a joke, contradicted something, and no [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1541.8s)]
*  problem. At dinner, he was asking me about the nuclear situation in Iran in a very genuine, [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1548.4399999999998s)]
*  hey, I think you're a smart guy. I want your opinion sort of way. I said, well, obviously, [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1554.04s)]
*  you're privy to things about it, and I'm not. But for what it's worth, I thought the Obama deal was [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1558.36s)]
*  worth letting play out because we made Iran destroy 98% of the uranium. And they were 15 years away [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1564.9199999999998s)]
*  from a bomb. And then I said to him, but we got rid of that. You got rid of that. He didn't get [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1574.36s)]
*  mad or call me a left-wing lunatic. He took it in. So there was that, and there were also some [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1580.52s)]
*  things that they agreed on, including the border needing to be controlled, cops, DEI going too far, [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1587.16s)]
*  etc. Seems like they got along fabulously. And some way, somehow, [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1594.3600000000001s)]
*  Marr sort of changed his tune on Trump. Why can't we get the guy I met to be the public guy? [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1601.4s)]
*  We're not saying it's our responsibility to do that. It's not. I'm just reporting exactly [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1608.8400000000001s)]
*  what I saw over two and a half hours. A crazy person doesn't live in the White House. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1613.32s)]
*  Person who plays a crazy person on TV a lot lives there, which I know is effed up. It's not [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1618.28s)]
*  as effed up as I thought it was. So there you have it. You can hate me for it, but I'm not a liar. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1625.32s)]
*  Trump was gracious, measured. Why he isn't that in other settings, I don't know and I can't answer. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1632.12s)]
*  It's not my place to answer. I'm just telling you what I saw, and I wasn't high. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1638.6799999999998s)]
*  Now, he clarified that he did not go full MAGA following the dinner and is still a staunch [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1645.8s)]
*  liberal. But he does view Trump in a different light now, it seems. Look, I get it. Doesn't [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1652.4399999999998s)]
*  matter who he is at a private dinner with a comedian. It matters who he is on the world [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1661.8s)]
*  stage. I'm just taking talking. It's a positive that this person exists because [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1666.6s)]
*  everything I've ever not liked about him was I swear to God. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1672.84s)]
*  Absent, at least on this night with this guy. Do you find this fascinating and a worthwhile [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1677.0s)]
*  observation? Tell all by Bill Maher, do we need to know this? [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1687.72s)]
*  Do we need to understand this side of Donald Trump? Is that supposed to give us comfort or [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1696.6000000000001s)]
*  just I guess what's your takeaway? Yeah. Okay, so some mixed thoughts on it, [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1701.72s)]
*  but I get it and overall I'm in favor of it. So number one, meeting with the president is not [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1707.16s)]
*  a problem at all. I don't care who the president is. If I have an opportunity to meet with the [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1714.28s)]
*  president, I will. In fact, if he's on the opposing side, I might want to meet with him more. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1717.96s)]
*  Is there anything I could do that helps a little bit? Sometimes people straw man and they go, [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1722.44s)]
*  oh my God, if you meet with the president and he doesn't walk out a completely changed man, [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1728.92s)]
*  then it was worthless and it was a failure. To get real, of course that's not gonna happen, [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1732.6s)]
*  right? But can you move him an inch? And moving the president an inch is a big deal, [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1739.16s)]
*  right? Can you get him to see a different perspective that he didn't see before? [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1743.88s)]
*  Might that affect him down the road? Those are all mites and stuff, but it's a lot better than [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1748.3600000000001s)]
*  not trying. What do you gain if you don't go to the dinner? Nothing. What do you try if you [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1753.96s)]
*  don't go to the dinner? Nothing. I don't see how that helps. So okay, then how did Bill do at the [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1760.6000000000001s)]
*  dinner? Well, look, what he reported back is mixed news in there. I don't particularly care if Donald [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1765.4s)]
*  Trump is nice behind the scenes. Okay, great, God bless. There is one part of that I do care about, [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1772.28s)]
*  which is that when you're with any Democratic leader, it's true, you're always walking on [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1776.76s)]
*  eggshells because ironically, they have thinner skin than Trump. If you're not constantly [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1782.52s)]
*  beseeching and enormously respectful and jettiflucting and etc., they're like, [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1788.76s)]
*  are no decline. The Democrats are obsessed with status, obsessed. They're constantly looking at [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1794.44s)]
*  your social ranking. Or do you have a title? What kind of title? Are you a donor? What kind [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1800.6s)]
*  of donor, etc. Whereas Trump's more like, here's a guy in the room with me. Okay, what do you got? [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1806.04s)]
*  What do you think, right? So that's better in my opinion. Okay, well, that's small, right? But [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1811.9599999999998s)]
*  okay, he was nice to you at the dinner or he's nice to me at a lunch or something. I don't care [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1819.7199999999998s)]
*  at all. That doesn't affect the voters and it doesn't affect what I think of Donald Trump. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1824.1999999999998s)]
*  Because what I care about is how he acts as president. And to be fair to [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1829.08s)]
*  more, he's pointing out, yeah, when he's in public, he's a madman and he is. So is it an act? [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1833.1599999999999s)]
*  Is it better if it's an act? Is it worse if it's an act? I don't know. All I care about is, [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1840.4399999999998s)]
*  yes, but what does he do, right? And what he does as president so far is totally unhinged. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1845.8s)]
*  Talking about sending now American citizens to a dungeon in El Salvador from time to time, [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1852.04s)]
*  not listening to the courts, it's madness, right? So then, okay, now we get to the final [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1857.32s)]
*  and most important part. Did Bill do any good there in some of the things that he brought up? [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1861.56s)]
*  And I would argue yes. So he brought up several things and a couple I was surprised by. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1866.2s)]
*  And so the fact that he plugged Obama's Iran deal, that's awesome. He's absolutely right about that. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1873.24s)]
*  It takes courage to say, hey, the deal that you got us out of was a terrific deal. You should put [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1883.16s)]
*  us back into that deal. So that's speaking truth to power, right? And by the way, that means that [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1888.76s)]
*  Maher is not in favor of attacking Iran, which is what Israel wants. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1895.88s)]
*  And he told Trump that. And Trump views him as the Israel guy, which because he is. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1900.6000000000001s)]
*  And here's somebody that he views to be on his side on that issue going, [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1905.16s)]
*  don't attack Iran. I'll take it. I'll definitely take that, right? And he even [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1909.16s)]
*  criticizes Gaza policy. Wow, I'll definitely take that, right? So again, guys, don't be unrealistic. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1914.1200000000001s)]
*  Bill told him at a dinner, so Donald Trump is not gonna go back into the Obama deal on Iran? [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1922.68s)]
*  No, of course not. I don't expect that. Bill Maher doesn't expect that. But is it an extra voice [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1927.64s)]
*  against the war with Iran? And is that a good thing? Absolutely. Hopefully more and more of [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1933.8799999999999s)]
*  those voices will add up. So Sharon, when I look at it overall, I think, [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1939.24s)]
*  I don't think it's world changing, but I think it was a good effort and it probably did some good. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1944.2s)]
*  That's my take on it. What's your take on it? [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1948.9199999999998s)]
*  I agree with you. I wouldn't have an issue with you going in there and coming out and giving your [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1951.3999999999999s)]
*  honest assessment. And I'm not suggesting that Bill Maher wasn't genuine or completely honest. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1959.0s)]
*  But I guess one thing that I'm thinking about, and again, I agree with you, but Donald Trump is a, [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1965.4s)]
*  some would say con artist, but let's just call him an artist of personalities. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1973.72s)]
*  And he knows that when he invites you over how to butter you up and make you feel so good and pretend [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1978.36s)]
*  that he's listening. And maybe he is, okay? You know the last person in the room can usually have [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1984.52s)]
*  some effect on him. But I wonder what you think about someone going in there with Trump's agenda [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1990.04s)]
*  is let me play this guy enough so that he'll go normalize me to his following, which is significant. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=1997.56s)]
*  And so I wonder how you feel about that. And again, I'm not saying that that happened or Bill [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2004.52s)]
*  Maher is stupid or gullible. But when Donald Trump wants an audience with you, even if Kid Rock [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2010.68s)]
*  set it up, you know he hates his guts. I think you feel like a chosen one and that's the human [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2018.3600000000001s)]
*  nature. So I don't know. I just wonder about that part. By and large, I agree. I would go sit down. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2024.8400000000001s)]
*  I would, okay? And I probably would listen and I'd have some openness, yes. But I just wonder [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2031.24s)]
*  about that part. Yeah, so actually in our live chat poll, you know the show's live Monday to Friday, [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2036.92s)]
*  starts at six o'clock Eastern, goes to eight o'clock. And then we have an extra bonus episode [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2042.68s)]
*  for members. I'm gonna quote another member in a second. But in the live chat we asked, do you think [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2046.6000000000001s)]
*  Bill Maher will be softer on Trump now? So that's kind of a post question, right? After the dinner, [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2051.2400000000002s)]
*  that's the issue that Sharon just brought up. My issue was how did the dinner go? Did it help in [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2057.96s)]
*  any way, shape or form? The secondary thing is now Maher going to lean more towards Trump, [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2063.08s)]
*  etc. And 79% of you think that he will. I'm gonna go on a limb here and I am on a limb on this one, [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2069.56s)]
*  but I'm gonna say no, I don't think he will. And I say that as a guy who was heavily criticized [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2077.3199999999997s)]
*  Bill Maher, right? But he read a list, so why do I say that? He read a list of the things [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2085.48s)]
*  that he already agreed with Trump on, including tightening up the border. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2092.92s)]
*  And he said, it'll go a little too far on DEI and a couple other things. And as he read that list, [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2097.96s)]
*  there was one or two things that I disagreed with. But overall, I was like, yeah, yeah, that is what [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2103.88s)]
*  Bill Maher has been saying. And I largely agree with Bill Maher on those things, I disagree on [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2108.04s)]
*  others. And so do I think that he'll go, was that his real list that he already agreed with Trump on? [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2112.6800000000003s)]
*  Yes, I've seen him say those things, right? Do I think he'll go further than that, [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2119.56s)]
*  give Trump a bigger break going forward? I can't believe I'm gonna trust Maher on this, [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2124.6s)]
*  no, but I do believe it. Look, for those opinions of his that drive me crazy, [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2132.92s)]
*  they are his real opinions, right? And so he's not faking that and I haven't seen him fake things [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2137.08s)]
*  before. And he is at a point where he's like, look, I have enough money, I have enough fame. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2144.44s)]
*  How does it help me to kiss Trump's ass, right? So, but if it turns out he's much softer on Trump, [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2150.76s)]
*  then I'll come back and tell you and say, hey, I screwed that one up, right? But okay, for now, [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2158.2000000000003s)]
*  I think that Maher won't and I'm in the minority on that. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2163.32s)]
*  So last thing here is from one of our members at Collecting Miscellania, right? By the way, [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2167.56s)]
*  you could be a member by hitting the join button below if you're watching on YouTube or [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2171.48s)]
*  tyt.com slash join to and he and eclectics from tyt.com. So anyway, he wrote it, [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2174.6s)]
*  maybe Jen could have a productive conversation with Trump because he would go into the conversation [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2181.32s)]
*  trying to accomplish something important. There's no way that Bill Maher went into that [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2185.08s)]
*  dinner thinking he would accomplish anything other than getting some headlines and inflating [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2188.36s)]
*  his already outsized ego. So eclectic, that I can't get too deep into Maher's psyche [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2191.64s)]
*  and psychoanalyze him on that. But I hear what you're saying, given the past. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2199.7999999999997s)]
*  And I appreciate your compliment about me. But the reason I read that is because [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2205.3999999999996s)]
*  he's right in that if I had the dinner with Trump, I would go in with a plan. And the plan would be, [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2210.2s)]
*  how do I get one of our priorities passed? Because everything else is just fun and games, [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2216.52s)]
*  except actual action, bills that pass, or in Trump's case, executive orders, etc, right? [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2222.52s)]
*  So I think Maher did some good by pushing, getting back into the Iran peace deal and not [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2228.6s)]
*  going to war. Could you have done more good if you made a pitch for paid family leave, [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2233.4s)]
*  one that he might be able to understand and actually go for? Well, no, you wouldn't. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2239.3199999999997s)]
*  Would you have over a 50% chance on that? No. But will I take a 20% chance on passing paid family [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2244.6s)]
*  leave under any administration? Yes. And so if you say, hey, that's naive, he'll never go for it. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2251.16s)]
*  Well, I'd rather have a 20% chance than a 0% chance. So I wish others in media cared as much [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2257.56s)]
*  about actual legislation and policy and really had a plan to be able to effectuate that in [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2263.96s)]
*  a Democratic administration or Republican administration. But that's probably asking [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2270.36s)]
*  for too much. So overall, jury's out on this dinner so far, but I like the idea. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2274.7599999999998s)]
*  And let's see if you guys are right or I'm right on what Bill does next. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2281.64s)]
*  I think he would have gone in there. I actually think it would have done something. I think he [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2285.0s)]
*  would have said, you know what? Because Dana White and Kid Rock don't care, but he would have said, [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2290.76s)]
*  write something up for me and I'll consider it. I actually think he might have been able to do [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2294.76s)]
*  something. Maybe he'll invite you next. We have much more to come. Do stay with us. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2298.6s)]
*  And be a very stable genius. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2302.92s)]
*  All right, back during the social break here, let's go to Super Chat first. The Dragon Grey [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2307.88s)]
*  wrote in, I'm a general contractor. One of my clients backed out of a $200,000 job this weekend [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2311.96s)]
*  due to unsure market. I knew this was coming, but thought it would be outrageous prices, not the [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2317.16s)]
*  market. So both things are a place, both the prices eventually and the market ahead of time. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2323.7200000000003s)]
*  So that's real life right there. People are already losing contracts. Some people losing jobs and [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2329.16s)]
*  prices are about to go up. So even if Trump backpedals out of all of his mistakes, [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2334.36s)]
*  he'll have done some significant damage in the meanwhile. Make it make sense says, [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2341.4s)]
*  happy Monday, Cenk. Can we take a minute to have a laugh at Gretchen Whitmer's hide behind a biter [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2346.28s)]
*  picture that in the memes it'll inspire for the next two elections, lol. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2351.56s)]
*  Hashtag, can we please make politics serious again? We are in fact going to talk about that [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2356.76s)]
*  a little bit later in the show and it was in fact hilarious. It was a remind me so much of [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2360.6s)]
*  the HBO show Veep. So but let's save that for a little bit later in the show. Andy Bean, [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2366.84s)]
*  2300 writes in, the Trump that Maher describes almost makes it worse for me. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2373.32s)]
*  I'd rather have a legitimate nutball as president versus someone who's faking being a nutball. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2379.56s)]
*  He could be reasonable, but isn't. Yeah, I don't know. That's a good question. Maybe we should do [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2384.92s)]
*  a poll question on the website for members. Would you rather have Trump be a legitimate nutcase [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2390.1200000000003s)]
*  or pretending to be a nutcase for political purposes? And what purposes would that be? [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2396.36s)]
*  I'm not sure I know which way I'd vote, but neither scenario is very good. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2405.88s)]
*  Okay. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2410.6000000000004s)]
*  I'm a very stable genius. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2411.1600000000003s)]
*  Are you brother? Are you? Darth Dundane writes in, Cenk, love listening to you today on Piers. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2412.6800000000003s)]
*  You were spot on again. Also love how civil you are with Vinny despite being on opposite sides of [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2418.36s)]
*  some issues. I wish more people would follow your example. Well, thank you for saying that. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2422.92s)]
*  I really appreciate it. Remember all of our press appearances can be seen on tyt.com [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2426.6800000000003s)]
*  slash press. So check that out or almost all of them. And we try to put them up as quickly [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2431.2400000000002s)]
*  as we can. Scuba Steve wrote in, tariffs can be useful if you have a plan and can target the [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2435.4s)]
*  right products. Just blanket tariffing can just be price increases. That's the comment I most agree [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2440.84s)]
*  with. Totally, totally agree. Tariffs can be done the right way, but this is definitely not it. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2447.08s)]
*  Phil Jay is a little bit more blunt. He just says it's the art of the stupid. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2452.1200000000003s)]
*  And that also is fair if you ask me, given what's happened so far. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2458.1200000000003s)]
*  Move in death says, TYT releases the chemicals in my brain that make me happy. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2462.1200000000003s)]
*  Wow. That's awesome. I love that. Thank you. Scott August says, time for Trump to be called in [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2466.52s)]
*  contempt and jailed. Scott love your brother, but that's not gonna happen. So you gotta get [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2473.32s)]
*  to a realistic plan. They tried impeaching him and jailing him and none of that worked. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2477.72s)]
*  And it's certainly not gonna work now. Cenk's left triceratophilia on tyt.com says, [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2483.48s)]
*  buy stock in alcohol, antidepressants and weed. It's going to be a long four years, folks. That's true. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2488.6s)]
*  All right, back on TYT. Cenk, Sharon, Anthony Byrom and John Fox. Thank you for joining, guys. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2500.8399999999997s)]
*  They hit the join button below. By the way, you could also just ring the bell or subscribe [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2507.16s)]
*  for free. And those are also very helpful to the show. Appreciate you guys. Sharon, what's next? [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2511.24s)]
*  Law and disorder, we'll call it. Got some answers today about the Maryland man mistakenly [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2515.24s)]
*  sent packing to El Salvador. Your Supreme Court, of course, has ruled that the United [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2522.92s)]
*  States government needs to facilitate the return of the Maryland man mistakenly deported, [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2528.2799999999997s)]
*  Kilmar Briego Garcia being held inside El Salvador's mega prison. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2533.32s)]
*  However, inside the Oval Office today in a meeting with President [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2538.76s)]
*  Donald Trump, El Salvador's president, Naib Bukele shut that down immediately. Said, [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2542.76s)]
*  it's not gonna happen, this man's return. But Kelly called the suggestion of [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2550.28s)]
*  a Briego Garcia's return to the US preposterous. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2553.96s)]
*  Can President Bukele weigh in on this? Do you plan to return him? [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2557.48s)]
*  Well, I guess I'm supposed to have suggested that I smuggle a terrorist into the United States. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2562.6s)]
*  They totally see that. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2567.64s)]
*  How can I return him to the United States? It's like I smuggle him into the United States, [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2569.4s)]
*  or whether I do it, of course, I'm not gonna do it. The question is preposterous. How can I [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2574.44s)]
*  smuggle a terrorist into the United States? I don't have the power to return him to the United States. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2581.16s)]
*  So leading up to that direct question of the president from El Salvador was [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2588.44s)]
*  Caitlin Collins and Stephen Miller, Trump aide saying, look, how presumptuous for you to believe [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2593.72s)]
*  that we can just usurp the authority of this sovereign nation and bring someone back who's [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2600.44s)]
*  under their control. How dare you? And then Caitlin Collins, CNN, asked the question directly [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2607.08s)]
*  of the president. Well, will you return him to the United States? And so you heard the answer there. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2612.7599999999998s)]
*  Now attorneys with the Department of Justice filed their brief on Sunday. They argued that [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2617.96s)]
*  a federal court has no authority to direct President Donald Trump or his administration [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2621.8s)]
*  in bringing home wrongly deported Marilyn Man Kilmar Briego Garcia. And she rejected requests [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2625.88s)]
*  filed on his behalf by attorneys last week. Media with the reporting here, the court should deny [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2631.24s)]
*  plaintiffs requests for further relief. The brief filed by the administration reads, [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2637.24s)]
*  the relief sought by plaintiffs is inconsistent with the Supreme Court's instruction requiring [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2642.3599999999997s)]
*  this court to respect the president's Article II authority to manage foreign policy. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2646.8399999999997s)]
*  Now the filing came after lawyers for Briego Garcia and his family asked the court to compel [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2653.64s)]
*  Trump and the federal government to take steps to bring him back to the United States. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2659.7999999999997s)]
*  Briego Garcia, citizen of El Salvador, was deported there by mistake. The administration [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2666.36s)]
*  admits that administrative error, having legal permission to live in the US where [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2672.44s)]
*  he spent the last 14 years alongside his wife, three children. All of them are US citizens. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2677.96s)]
*  State Department official Michael Kozak filed an update on a Briego Garcia's status on Saturday, [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2685.48s)]
*  indicating quote, well, he is alive, secure in that facility. He is detained pursuant to [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2691.24s)]
*  the sovereign domestic authority of El Salvador. So not exactly proof of life, you just gotta take [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2700.04s)]
*  what they say. I mean, that's what he's telling the court, the Trump administration, that's as far [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2708.2s)]
*  as they'll go from what we hear. There's another hearing in federal court tomorrow where you can [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2712.2799999999997s)]
*  expect the judge to kind of ramp it up. But it seems like in the last hearing, Cenk, [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2718.36s)]
*  the Trump administration officials are no longer stammering or kind of [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2723.4s)]
*  cowering even in front of the bench. They're basically saying, well, this is what we're doing [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2727.88s)]
*  and it's not much. Yeah, maybe we shouldn't send people to a foreign prison if we can't get them [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2734.2000000000003s)]
*  back. And maybe we shouldn't send them there without checking with the courts first to see [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2741.32s)]
*  if they're the right people or not. That's what we in America call a due process. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2746.04s)]
*  It's actually one of the foundational pillars of Western civilization. Or we can go with, [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2750.6s)]
*  I don't know who they are, who cares? Let's round them up, let's send them to El Salvador. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2758.44s)]
*  I can't get them back, oops. Okay, again, if you're on the right wing, how does that help you? [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2763.48s)]
*  If you wanna get rid of undocumented immigrants who are criminals, who are in gangs like the [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2769.32s)]
*  Venezuelan gang, MS-13, etc. If we start sending in innocent people with them, [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2775.4s)]
*  then everybody's gonna turn against that program. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2783.2400000000002s)]
*  I mean, if you're a decent person, you don't wanna send an innocent guy to a dungeon. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2787.4s)]
*  We can have a conversation, debate, hey, should we send anybody to El Salvador? [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2793.08s)]
*  Why are we even doing that? Why don't we just deport them to their home countries? [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2796.84s)]
*  Their home country is El Salvador and they broke the law here, that makes sense. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2799.7200000000003s)]
*  They broke the law in their home countries, Venezuela, maybe that makes sense, right? [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2803.4s)]
*  Or by the way, if they broke the law here, have them in a maximum security prison, [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2807.2400000000002s)]
*  have them serve their time, get justice then deport them. But all of that is not going to [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2810.44s)]
*  be very popular if you keep sending the wrong guys and go, I don't care that they're innocent, [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2815.2400000000002s)]
*  don't care at all. In fact, now we're gonna smear them. Even though we've admitted in court [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2819.8s)]
*  wrong guy, administrative error. Then I'm gonna turn around and go, [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2824.28s)]
*  I don't care that it was the wrong guy. I like sending wrong guys to the dungeons. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2828.36s)]
*  Okay, then everybody hates you, not everybody. Some portion of magas like, yes, we sent the wrong [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2833.0s)]
*  guy in. And then or they're listening to right wing media and Stephen Miller and those guys are [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2838.6s)]
*  lying through their teeth. And they're going, he's part of MS-13, he belongs there anyway. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2843.3199999999997s)]
*  But no, courts have already ruled several times here, originally before they picked them up, [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2849.56s)]
*  and after they picked them up. You got the wrong guy. And the Trump team admits it in court, [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2854.9199999999996s)]
*  and they go, no, I don't want him back though. Now that's just that, [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2861.8s)]
*  not only is it totally unreasonable, it's un-American. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2865.96s)]
*  Now it's about to get worse, we're gonna share with you in a second. But on this alone, I mean, [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2869.2400000000002s)]
*  what kind of monster says, yeah, I sent an innocent man to maybe the worst prison in the world. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2874.84s)]
*  And I don't mind, I don't care that he's innocent. I think he should just rot in there. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2882.6800000000003s)]
*  It's better that he rot away the rest of his life mistakenly than my ego be affected at all. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2887.0s)]
*  I just rather pretend I'm right anyway. Person who does that is a really bad guy. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2895.64s)]
*  Okay, now Sharon, let's tell them how much worse it's about to get. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2901.24s)]
*  Well, it could be, you could be next, anyone could be next, any citizen perhaps during Trump's [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2903.56s)]
*  meeting with Kelly. He also talked about his desire to send American citizens to the prisons [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2910.36s)]
*  in El Salvador. Aaron Rupar posted this clip, but Kelly and Trump enter in the Oval Office to X. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2917.08s)]
*  The criminals are next. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2924.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2928.12s)]
*  I said homegrowns are next. The homegrowns, you gotta build about five more places. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2928.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, that's better. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2934.2000000000003s)]
*  All right. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2935.4s)]
*  It's not big enough. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2939.56s)]
*  Plus like 20,000 of prisoners or something. It's good business for him, young leader there. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2942.6s)]
*  Hard to make out, but Trump says homegrowns are next. We know what that means, the homegrowns, [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2948.76s)]
*  you gotta build about five more places. It's not big enough. He brought it up again during [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2954.52s)]
*  the official press conference. If it's a homegrown criminal, I have no problem. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2960.52s)]
*  Now we're studying the laws right now. If we could do that, that's good. It's scary. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2966.04s)]
*  And maybe the scariest part is he means it, Cenk. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2974.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2979.96s)]
*  He would love to do that. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2980.92s)]
*  Yeah. Okay, so for like, I asked Magana, really? You guys wanna send US citizens, by the way, so far, [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2982.04s)]
*  he's done it with no due process, not even checking with the courts. And you wanna give [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2990.52s)]
*  any American president the right to send any American citizen to a foreign dungeon, [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=2995.8s)]
*  and we can't get them back based on whether the president thinks they're a bad guy. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3002.2s)]
*  Whether the president thinks they're a bad guy. Joe Biden thought there was a lot of Republican bad [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3009.4s)]
*  guys. Imagine he's like, yeah, I already sent Trump to El Salvador. Sorry, can't get him back. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3014.44s)]
*  But he was running against you. And we didn't get to judge yet whether he took the national secrets [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3020.44s)]
*  or did financial fraud or whatever. Sorry, sent him there already. Nothing I can do, my hands are [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3025.4s)]
*  bound. There goes Stephen Miller, there goes Peter Navarro, there goes Stephen. Nothing I could do. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3031.72s)]
*  Once I sent him to El Salvador, they're gone forever. It was an administrative error, [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3037.64s)]
*  it doesn't matter. I'm not doing due process. I'm not going to the courts. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3041.88s)]
*  And if the courts tell me to bring him back, I won't. Is that the system you want? You think [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3045.16s)]
*  that's American? You think that's constitutional? No, that is not at all constitutional. That is not [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3049.88s)]
*  at all American. That's a weird, sick thing where you just decide you're authoritarian and can send [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3056.2s)]
*  people to foreign dungeons. So that's exactly what we warned you about. I've said this many times, [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3062.52s)]
*  but populists that are on other parts of the political spectrum, well, why you hate Cenk? [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3069.88s)]
*  You claim you hate the establishment so much. Why'd you vote for Kamala Harris and even back in 2016 [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3074.44s)]
*  to Hillary Clinton instead of Donald Trump? Because they were running against Donald Trump. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3081.0s)]
*  Donald Trump keeps saying it after 2020, after he lost the election. He said, [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3086.28s)]
*  we should terminate the Constitution. He wasn't kidding. His supporters said, [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3090.28s)]
*  chanted, hang Mike Pence, hang Mike Pence. His chief of staff tells him about it. He says he [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3095.0s)]
*  deserves it. That guy's not going to listen to the law. That guy's not going to listen to the [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3099.0800000000004s)]
*  Constitution. That's why I was so adamant about trying to drive by now. Not because I wanted [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3103.8s)]
*  the Democrats to lose, but because I didn't want Trump to win. And Biden in the race was a [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3111.2400000000002s)]
*  guaranteed loss. And yeah, that's what happened. He stayed in until we couldn't fix it anymore. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3115.8s)]
*  So, if you're a right winger and you thought it was all just fun and games and he wasn't really [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3122.44s)]
*  going to violate the Constitution. That even though he says terminate the Constitution, [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3128.92s)]
*  even though he's done all these unconstitutional things. Even though he clearly tried to stay in [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3133.0s)]
*  office after he lost, you thought no, secretly he loves the Constitution and loves democracy. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3137.0800000000004s)]
*  He doesn't. He only cares about power. He doesn't care about the US Constitution one bit. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3142.84s)]
*  And by the way, I don't know who those jackass people in the White House were, [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3150.44s)]
*  reporters or staffers. He's like, yeah, maybe we send the homegirls to your dungeon, right? [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3153.8s)]
*  Send some US citizens to your dungeon. They're like, that's so funny. Who the hell are you? [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3158.28s)]
*  Why is that funny? So, and then last thing is this Kafka-esque thing that the [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3164.28s)]
*  the president of El Salvador said. Where he's like, no, I cannot send them back to you. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3170.92s)]
*  What do you want me to smuggle in terrorists? Really, there's nothing the US or El Salvador [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3176.44s)]
*  can do to send one person from El Salvador to America. Can't happen. They haven't invented [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3181.0s)]
*  planes. They don't know how can they possibly do it? Okay, so here one of our members on TYT.com, [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3185.88s)]
*  Joseph Yakim wrote in, cut the money to El Salvador and the president will return him fast. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3192.44s)]
*  Exactly right. Do we have ways of incentivizing certain countries to do some things? [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3199.56s)]
*  Yeah, like when we gave the president of El Salvador $6 million to take in these prisoners. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3206.6s)]
*  If we said, hey, you know what? Well, that's okay. We're not gonna give you the $6 million. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3211.96s)]
*  He's on a plane within an hour. Okay, the idea of, there's nothing either leader could do. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3215.48s)]
*  It's just absurd. Please don't tell me that you believe that. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3222.6800000000003s)]
*  That's yeah. So Sharon, at the end of the day, look, I don't know if, [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3227.1600000000003s)]
*  to what degree his voters will turn on him and what percentage of his voters will turn on him. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3234.76s)]
*  If he tries this on American citizens, but if that doesn't do it and he actually starts sending [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3240.36s)]
*  Americans to El Salvador and says, that's it. I'm not gonna ask the courts. I'm just starting to [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3246.28s)]
*  send people I don't like who are US citizens to El Salvador and I'm never going to bring them back. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3252.76s)]
*  Yeah, I think his popularity will fall to 12%. But I hope I'm right. But that's mental. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3259.7200000000003s)]
*  I mean, if you're defending that, you just don't believe in this country. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3267.5600000000004s)]
*  I don't know that I have the same hope, but the one thing's for sure. He's gonna push and push [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3270.52s)]
*  and push and test the limits until there are no more boundaries until he stopped on this one. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3279.56s)]
*  Much more to come that does it for our first hour. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3287.32s)]
*  All right, back on to you IT. So here's what I'm gonna read a couple comments for you guys [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3295.16s)]
*  that will take another break and go to the second hour where we got some huge stories [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3298.68s)]
*  coming up for you. But first, let me give a shout out to all the folks that are watching and [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3302.2799999999997s)]
*  some good points in here as well. Never writes in my condolences Americans. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3307.72s)]
*  I hope you recover from your constitutional crisis soon. We hope that too. Michael Napier [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3311.72s)]
*  writes in, Cenk looking sassy with his new haircut. Did he also do his brows? Well, actually, [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3317.64s)]
*  I found a Turkish barber in LA and they burned my ear hairs off. So that's super fun. I'm gonna take [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3322.44s)]
*  my son next time. That's actually a real thing with Turkish barbers. So check that out if you [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3327.88s)]
*  get a chance or don't. Anyway, Michael also wrote, setting love and healing vibes to Anna in case [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3332.6800000000003s)]
*  she's watching as am I. Thank you for remembering that, Michael. We appreciate it. She'll be back [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3337.88s)]
*  soon. Boomer Dragon Kat says, we can refine the message to Magda. He isn't talking to you now. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3344.6800000000003s)]
*  He never was talking to you. All these years, he's only been talking to the top 10%. The rest of us [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3350.28s)]
*  really don't even register as human to him, mark my words. Kat, I mean, that's exactly the framing [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3355.08s)]
*  that I'm going with. Not in those words, but challenge the powerful, criticize the powerful, [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3360.68s)]
*  right? For his voters, remember, he's not even on your side. If you're a Trump voter, [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3368.68s)]
*  you're gonna see. He's on the side of the elites and the establishment. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3375.56s)]
*  You thought the tariffs were gonna stay forever. We told you they weren't and they didn't. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3379.08s)]
*  And now you think that that tax cuts coming in your direction, it's not. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3384.44s)]
*  The great majority is for corporations and the wealthy. And so the 56% go to the rich [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3388.92s)]
*  of just a personal income tax stuff. And then there's a giant, another giant giveaway to [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3395.7999999999997s)]
*  corporations. So when I say the rich, top 1%, okay? So they're literally giving the richest people in [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3400.6s)]
*  the country trillions of dollars. Trump's not for MAGA, Trump's for the elites. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3409.72s)]
*  He just does it in a different way. 36 Chambers Dragon wrote in a couple of times. I wonder, [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3415.08s)]
*  there's some longer messages I'd love to get a chance to read, but we're gonna run out of time [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3420.3599999999997s)]
*  here. He said, I'm so done with Bill Maher, he's such a sellout little bitch. Okay, I hear you, [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3423.8799999999997s)]
*  brother, but hold on, give him a chance. Let's see if he does soften up on Trump or if he still [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3429.3999999999996s)]
*  holds them to account. And then you can make your judgment. All right, we'll be right back. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3435.3199999999997s)]
*  All right, back on TYT here. Just a quick comment from our audience and our members. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3446.12s)]
*  True Seeker said on TYT.com, Cenk asked, what kind of a monster knows they got the wrong guy, [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3453.16s)]
*  but doesn't care? The same guy that found out the exonerated five were innocent and still wanted [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3458.28s)]
*  them to be imprisoned anyway. That's referring to the Central Park Five, and that's right. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3466.76s)]
*  And that's another reason why I voted against Trump. Central Park Five, they thought had [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3471.2400000000002s)]
*  committed rape and it was a ghastly crime. They were imprisoned, and then we found out it wasn't [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3476.52s)]
*  them. We found the real guy with his DNA and everything. They tell Trump, you wanted them [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3482.84s)]
*  executed, but turns out they were innocent. He's like, no, I don't care. They're guilty anyway. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3487.56s)]
*  They should still be in prison. Based on what? I mean, that sounds like lawfare, doesn't it? [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3492.84s)]
*  So Trump doesn't care about other human beings. I know that his voters don't realize that yet, [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3498.52s)]
*  but they're slowly beginning to realize it, very slowly. But I see it here and there. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3504.04s)]
*  And people are starting to scratch their heads and go, wait, [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3511.48s)]
*  how do these wild tariffs being on and being off and being on and being off help us? [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3515.08s)]
*  Wait, how does us having ground trips in Gaza help us? How does threatening war with Iran help [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3520.12s)]
*  us? How does going outside the Constitution over and over and over again help us? None of that stuff [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3525.64s)]
*  helps you at all. He doesn't care about you. He just cares about himself. All right, we gotta [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3531.56s)]
*  take a break here. So let's go take a break, come back for the second hour. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3538.52s)]
*  We got some super important stories in the second hour. Russia attacks Ukraine. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3547.8s)]
*  What am I gonna do with Trump? What's Trump's reaction? Well, you'll find out when we come back. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxbONwF4Nww&t=3553.32s)]
