"A liberal candidate for a pivotal seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court overcame $25 million in spending from Elon Musk and defeated her conservative opponent on Tuesday, The Associated Press reported, in a contest that became a kind of referendum on Mr. Musk and his slashing of the federal government."

# Elon Musk Gets SPANKED In Wisconsin
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [April 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY)
*  Elon Musk simply put is an unpopular guy. He is political poison. It was clearly a vote [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=0.0s)]
*  against what's going on right now in Washington. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=6.76s)]
*  Gavin Newsom, the governor of California calling the Democratic brand absolutely toxic and [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=10.84s)]
*  really problematic. Have Democrats shown yet that they are giving voters anything to vote [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=16.4s)]
*  for or is it simply just against Donald Trump? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=22.68s)]
*  So if there's one big lesson to take away from Wisconsin is Elon Musk does not help [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=26.4s)]
*  Republicans when he shows up. If anything, the data suggests that he hurts him. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=30.479999999999997s)]
*  Well big news for Democrats, Judge Susan Crawford has won a seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=37.16s)]
*  despite big spending from Elon Musk. He shelled out $25 million to beat this liberal candidate [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=43.68s)]
*  and he failed. Now Musk found other cheesy ways to try to corrupt the elections outcome. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=53.68s)]
*  Get a load of this. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=60.76s)]
*  Musk also showed up in Wisconsin Sunday night, donned a cheese head hat and offered to allegedly [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=63.16s)]
*  random voters $1 million each just for showing up. Still, Susan Crawford won a 10 year term [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=69.4s)]
*  in Wisconsin over her GOP rival Brad Schimel. This win enables the left to maintain a four [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=75.92s)]
*  to three majority in the swing state. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=81.08s)]
*  Now, despite Elon Musk's antics and despite the fact that he was feeling real confident [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=84.64s)]
*  before the election took place. Now that the election's over, he says, I totally expected [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=91.8s)]
*  to lose. I expected to throw away $25 million. He says I expected to lose but there is value [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=97.32s)]
*  to losing a piece for a positional gain. I mean, whose gain are we talking about? Because [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=104.72s)]
*  it's not your gain and we're gonna get to that in just a minute, okay? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=111.80000000000001s)]
*  But before we do, before we talk about the fate of Elon Musk, the Wisconsin Supreme Court [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=114.76s)]
*  election ended up being the most expensive court race in the United States in US history, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=120.16000000000001s)]
*  costing a whopping $100 million. And I am not talking about this as if it's a good thing. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=127.12s)]
*  That is awful, okay? That is absolutely awful. It's about double the amount of the second [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=133.08s)]
*  most expensive court race in the country. Now, Susan Crawford, a Dane County judge and [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=140.32s)]
*  former chief counsel to a Democratic governor, won the open seat ensuring liberals will keep [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=145.92s)]
*  their four to three majority. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=151.92000000000002s)]
*  She defeated Brad Schimel, a Waukesha County judge and former Republican Attorney General [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=155.04s)]
*  who of course embraced Trump. That's the reason why you had Elon Musk shelling out big bucks [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=161.16s)]
*  to essentially beat Crawford, but it didn't work. Now, Crawford won the race with 55% [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=166.1s)]
*  of the vote. And this was really seen as a referendum on the Trump administration. And [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=171.38s)]
*  remember, we covered a story just yesterday where two congressional Republicans spoke [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=176.85999999999999s)]
*  to Politico and they were actually hoping for this outcome. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=182.54s)]
*  Because it was their hope that the Trump administration would start to see Elon Musk as a bit of [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=186.16s)]
*  a liability and oust him from the White House. And we're gonna revisit that story in just [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=190.22s)]
*  a moment. But look, this is good news for Democrats, especially in the state of Wisconsin. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=194.54s)]
*  Now, Crawford will be sworn in on August 1st. And between now and then, the court is in [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=202.29999999999998s)]
*  fact expected to decide whether abortion remains legal in their state. But did Crawford win [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=207.88s)]
*  because Wisconsinites really like her or is this just about fighting back against the [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=213.39999999999998s)]
*  Trump administration? Is this just a referendum? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=219.04s)]
*  Well, CNN actually asked a Democratic congressman, Mark Pocan, and let's see what he has to say. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=221.78s)]
*  Were people voting for Susan Crawford? Or were they voting against the influence that [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=228.22s)]
*  Elon Musk was trying to put in this race? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=232.70000000000002s)]
*  But I think she'll even tell you, most people probably couldn't identify her if they were [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=236.06s)]
*  in line with her at a grocery store. That's just kind of the way it happens. But it was [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=239.74s)]
*  clearly a vote against what's going on right now in Washington. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=246.22s)]
*  And clearly, the voters who feel the most galvanized are going to show up to vote. And [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=253.22s)]
*  so it's definitely feasible that or likely that Trump supporters were not as galvanized [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=258.58s)]
*  and just didn't show up to vote. So I do see this as more of a referendum on the Trump [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=265.26s)]
*  administration. And by the way, Pocan in what he was saying in that last clip isn't wrong. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=270.21999999999997s)]
*  In fact, if you look at the breakdown of Elon Musk's favorability among voters, you'll [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=275.82s)]
*  get a sense of what he means. Let's take a look. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=281.06s)]
*  Elon Musk spent big in this race to sway the Supreme Court race. He also went to Wisconsin, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=284.82s)]
*  which may honestly have backfired. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=291.54s)]
*  Yeah, I think it may have backfired. Look, I think if there's one thing we should be [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=293.14s)]
*  taking away from the results in Wisconsin and the polling that we have from Wisconsin [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=296.58s)]
*  and national. If you are a Republican candidate running in a swing state, you don't want Elon [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=300.58s)]
*  Musk anywhere near you. Yes, maybe you like the money, but you do not want his presence [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=305.26s)]
*  in your state. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=309.78s)]
*  Why is that? Elon Musk simply put is an unpopular guy. He is political poison. Look in Wisconsin, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=311.03999999999996s)]
*  his net favorable rating minus 12 points, 12 points underwater. That is an even worse [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=317.26s)]
*  number when you look nationally. Look at that. It's minus 17 points. So if there's one big [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=322.5s)]
*  lesson to take away from Wisconsin is Elon Musk does not help Republicans when he shows [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=327.5s)]
*  up. If anything, the data suggests that he hurts him. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=331.85999999999996s)]
*  Republicans, stay clear of Elon Musk if you want to win in a swing state, at least in [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=335.41999999999996s)]
*  terms of his physical appearance in your state. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=339.46s)]
*  Yeah, definitely in terms of his physical appearance in your state. No, I love everything [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=342.46s)]
*  about that segment. Harry Anton has really grown on me to be honest with you. But the [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=348.97999999999996s)]
*  CNN host cracked me up because he's like, Elon Musk even went to Wisconsin. Can you [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=353.82s)]
*  believe it? It's like, okay. Yeah, I can believe it. What's a big deal about him going to Wisconsin? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=359.62s)]
*  Of course, he's gonna go to Wisconsin if he cares enough about this race. And clearly [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=365.58s)]
*  he did and I'm happy to see that he lost. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=370.21999999999997s)]
*  Now, but this does beg an important question in regard to the fate of the Democratic Party. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=373.46s)]
*  And more importantly, look, I don't care about the parties to be honest with you, okay? I [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=379.18s)]
*  care about whether or not there are members of Congress, members of either party who are [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=383.41999999999996s)]
*  actually looking out for the American people, looking to do the right thing. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=390.41999999999996s)]
*  And what I want to avoid, what I'm personally getting super blackpilled by, is this super [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=394.85999999999996s)]
*  annoying back and forth pendulum swing from one group of loser do nothing politicians [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=400.53999999999996s)]
*  to another group of loser do nothing politicians because they feed off each other, right? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=408.09999999999997s)]
*  What they do is they get elected, right? They say that they want to be public servants. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=413.26s)]
*  They say they want to help the American people, but they get elected, they're in power. They [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=418.68s)]
*  do the opposite. Americans get mad and then they vote in subsequent elections as a referendum [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=422.58s)]
*  to those who are in charge. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=429.06s)]
*  And then the pendulum goes back and forth, back and forth, not based on whether the politicians [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=430.86s)]
*  are actually gonna do something for you. But based on wanting to punish the politicians [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=435.65999999999997s)]
*  who are screwing you over. That's why we don't get anything done. So we need to break that [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=441.97999999999996s)]
*  cycle and I feel that this last presidential election was a little bit of that breaking [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=447.34s)]
*  the cycle, right? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=454.09999999999997s)]
*  Because voters were like, yeah, yeah, we don't like Trump. But we're not happy with the Democrats, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=455.64s)]
*  so we're gonna stay home. That was one of the main reasons why Donald Trump won the [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=460.47999999999996s)]
*  last presidential election. So I think it's really important for Democrats to stop coasting, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=463.65999999999997s)]
*  sitting back, playing dead as James Carville said they should do. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=469.9s)]
*  And allowing the Trump administration to basically destroy themselves or destroy their favorability [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=473.65999999999997s)]
*  among the American people. So by default, Democrats will easily win again. I want them [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=481.09999999999997s)]
*  to do something. I want them to offer something. I want to hear what their ideas are. But if [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=487.21999999999997s)]
*  you listen to Pocan, doesn't seem like they're thinking about new ideas. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=493.88s)]
*  He acknowledges that this was a referendum on the Trump administration. But he acknowledges [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=499.8s)]
*  something else in this next clip that worries me. Take a look. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=503.76s)]
*  Gavin Newsom, the governor of California calling the Democratic brand absolutely toxic and [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=508.96s)]
*  really problematic. Have Democrats shown yet that they are giving voters anything to vote [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=514.48s)]
*  for or is it simply just against Donald Trump? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=520.76s)]
*  Well, we're gonna make sure that Social Security doesn't get cut. We're gonna protect Medicare [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=525.08s)]
*  and Medicaid. We're gonna make sure that education is still funded and we're not cutting things [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=530.16s)]
*  like food assistance or veterans hospital assistance. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=534.68s)]
*  I mean, we're already having problems with people getting veterans at hospital appointments [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=537.96s)]
*  because of the cuts by Donald Trump and Elon Musk. First of all, we're normal, right? We [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=541.3199999999999s)]
*  want to go back to normal and I think that means something these days. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=545.82s)]
*  Normal is what got Trump elected. Normal is what led to Trump sweeping the swing states. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=553.86s)]
*  No, I'm tired of normal. I don't know about you guys. Maybe you guys have had enough of [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=562.7800000000001s)]
*  Trump's second term where you're just like, okay, please, we'll go back to how awful things [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=569.5400000000001s)]
*  were prior to Trump getting elected. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=573.12s)]
*  I don't want that. I'm sick of that. Okay, there are too many people suffering in this [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=575.4200000000001s)]
*  country for us to keep doing this pendulum swing with these self-interested narcissistic [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=579.62s)]
*  politicians who don't want to do a damn thing for you. But for whatever reason, want this [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=585.7s)]
*  position of power to benefit themselves, give themselves an ego boost. I don't know what [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=590.38s)]
*  it is. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=595.14s)]
*  But Mark, don't ever repeat that phrase again, ever, okay? Normal is not good enough. And [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=596.42s)]
*  Democrats right now need to be thinking about their long-term game plan. Who are we? What [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=604.1s)]
*  do we represent? What are we gonna offer to the American people that will make us appealing [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=610.74s)]
*  to voters? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=615.74s)]
*  If they're planning on running a 2020 message of vote for us for normalcy, I just, I can't [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=617.9399999999999s)]
*  stomach it. I can't stomach it. We are falling behind as a nation. Things are falling apart. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=625.38s)]
*  And they really need to be asking themselves, how the hell did the guy who literally ran [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=633.06s)]
*  his whole campaign on tariffs beat us in the last election? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=638.78s)]
*  So look, I don't mean to rain on the Democrats parade. What happened in Wisconsin is great. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=643.22s)]
*  But what happened in Wisconsin happened not for the right reasons. It happened as a referendum [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=648.02s)]
*  to Trump. It didn't happen because people are loving the Democrats. So Democrats need [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=654.0s)]
*  to get their act together. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=658.56s)]
*  That's the point that I wanna make about that. Now, let's talk a little bit about the money [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=659.64s)]
*  in the race, cuz I think that's super important here. Cuz it's worth pointing out the insane [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=665.12s)]
*  amount of money and influence billionaires have over these elections, even court-related [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=668.96s)]
*  elections. So Crawford benefited from large donations to the State Democratic Party from [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=675.4s)]
*  liberal billionaires. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=681.12s)]
*  1.5 million from Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, 1 million from financier George Soros, and [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=682.4s)]
*  a quarter million dollars from LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman. So look, there are billionaire [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=687.8s)]
*  donors on both sides of the political aisle, right? So we talked a little bit about Elon [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=694.2s)]
*  Musk. So Musk engaged in some antics that were concerning, to say the least, outside [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=698.36s)]
*  of the original bribing politicians. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=705.56s)]
*  So Musk posted on X that he would give $1 million prizes in appreciation for you taking [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=708.68s)]
*  the time to vote. After legal scholars questioned the plan, he deleted the message and posted [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=715.06s)]
*  another one saying his event was open to Wisconsin registered voters who signed a petition opposing [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=720.56s)]
*  activist judges. On Sunday, Musk said the PAC would pay people $20 for each picture [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=727.04s)]
*  they took with a voter holding a photo of Crawford's opponent, Schiml, and giving a [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=734.36s)]
*  thumbs up, basically indicating that they're gonna vote for him and over Crawford. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=742.8000000000001s)]
*  Now there was some good news kind of in Florida, at least that's how Democrats are spinning [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=747.84s)]
*  it because there were two house races. These were the special elections in Florida and [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=751.78s)]
*  the Republicans won in each seat, okay, in each race. So for instance, Republican Randy [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=757.16s)]
*  Fine beat Josh Wilde in Mike Waltz's former seat in the sixth district. And he did so [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=762.74s)]
*  by about 14 points. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=771.72s)]
*  However, it's worth noting that Trump won it by 30 points. So Democrats are arguing, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=773.42s)]
*  looks like Republicans are losing some favorability in these districts. Another example was Jimmy [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=780.3s)]
*  Pateronis, who won the seat, he's the Republican, he won the seat vacated by Matt Gaetz in Florida's [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=786.26s)]
*  first district. And in that race, he won over the Democrat by 15 points. However, Trump [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=793.24s)]
*  won by 37 points in that district. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=799.8s)]
*  So there is a little bit of, I guess, positive movement in favor of Democrats when it comes [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=802.62s)]
*  to certain areas of the country. But I don't really know if it's about a referendum on [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=809.3s)]
*  Trump or if it's just that this was a special election or these were special elections. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=815.42s)]
*  And people who would typically vote for a Trump-backed candidate didn't show up to vote. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=820.4599999999999s)]
*  Now, again, overall, this is good news, but it's not good news for Elon Musk. Because [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=826.3399999999999s)]
*  apparently the results of the special election might mean that Musk has overstayed his welcome [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=833.9s)]
*  over at the White House. Now, there were two congressional Republicans who spoke to Politico [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=838.9799999999999s)]
*  and basically said they were hoping that there would be big wins for Democrats in these special [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=843.74s)]
*  elections. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=848.34s)]
*  So there would be an attempt to oust Elon Musk from the White House. And it looks like [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=849.38s)]
*  that might be happening, although there are denials about it. And we'll get to the denials [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=854.26s)]
*  in just a second. So the president remains pleased with Musk and his Department of Government [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=858.34s)]
*  Efficiency Initiative. But both men have decided in recent days that it will soon be time for [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=863.9s)]
*  Musk to return to his businesses and take on a supporting role, according to three Trump [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=869.26s)]
*  insiders who were granted anonymity to describe the evolving relationship. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=875.1s)]
*  Now Trump administration insiders and many outside allies have become frustrated with [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=880.22s)]
*  his unpredictability and increasingly view the billionaire, Elon Musk, as a political [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=884.26s)]
*  liability. Now, although one senior Trump advisor did tell Politico that Musk is likely [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=889.66s)]
*  to retain an informal role, like an advisor role with the administration and will likely [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=896.22s)]
*  still be seen to some extent on the White House grounds. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=901.96s)]
*  It does seem that the time is up for Musk in regard to the more prominent role he's [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=905.94s)]
*  been playing with the Trump administration. And it's also important to mention that his [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=911.6s)]
*  leaving the White House in a more outward facing position, I guess, is likely to correspond [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=918.82s)]
*  with the end of Musk's time as a special government employee. So you can be a special government [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=926.36s)]
*  employee for 130 days, those 130 days are almost up. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=931.4000000000001s)]
*  So it kind of corresponds with the timing of these special elections and that could [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=935.0600000000001s)]
*  just be a coincidence. But Trump had already stated or started, I should say, transitioning [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=940.76s)]
*  Elon Musk out of the White House. That was announced last week. He held a meeting on [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=945.9200000000001s)]
*  March 24th with his cabinet members and essentially told them that Musk would be leaving soon. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=952.24s)]
*  But Musk is in denial about this and so is Caroline Levitt, or at least she's pretending [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=958.12s)]
*  to not know anything about this and say that it's all false. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=962.84s)]
*  So White House press secretary Levitt writes that this scoop is garbage. Elon Musk and [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=966.46s)]
*  President Trump have both publicly stated that Elon will depart from public service [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=971.5600000000001s)]
*  as a special government employee when his incredible work at Doge is complete. And Elon [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=975.74s)]
*  Musk quote tweets it with, yeah, fake news. So it's probably just about saving face and [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=980.3199999999999s)]
*  giving Elon Musk an exit that isn't embarrassing. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=987.6s)]
*  But he had fallen out of favor with quite a few Republicans, many of whom were too cowardly [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=990.1999999999999s)]
*  to come out publicly and instead would speak to Politico or other news outlets on an anonymous [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=994.28s)]
*  basis. But I do think that the Trump administration is finally waking up to the fact that Elon [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=1001.28s)]
*  Musk is a political liability. So hopefully we'll see a little less of him, but we're [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=1006.8s)]
*  gonna have to wait and see. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6OOLvFMpYY&t=1012.04s)]
