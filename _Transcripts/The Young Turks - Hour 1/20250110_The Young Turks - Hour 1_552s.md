"CHARLIE KIRK (HOST): And when California, in a couple of weeks, comes crawling back for federal assistance, Trump should say, listen, I'm not gonna give you a dime unless you fire the lesbian Kristens. You mandate the proper forest management and stop controlled burns that Newsom has stopped. You cut it out with California's failed diversity, equity, inclusion homeless spending. You require water capture instead of flushing it into the ocean. We're not gonna pay for this anymore. This is your own making.

When Florida gets hurt by a hurricane ‚Äî hit by a hurricane, FPL, Florida Power and Light, has power coming back in a couple days. They also build their homes in a certain way to be hurricane proof. California, they're so left-wing, yhey're so liberal, they're so out of touch, they're so earth worshiping, and now entire neighborhoods are gone as if an atomic bomb was dropped. In 2020, Pacific Palisades voted 70% for Joe Biden. So it's 70-30."

# Charlie Kirk's UNBELIEVABLE Message to LA Fire Victims
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [January 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94)
*  And when California in a couple of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=0.0s)]
*  weeks comes crawling back for [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=2.06s)]
*  federal assistance, Trump should [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=3.84s)]
*  say, listen, I'm not going to give [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=6.140000000000001s)]
*  you a dime unless you fire [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=8.08s)]
*  the lesbian Christians. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=9.42s)]
*  Okay, so that's a very strange [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=11.6s)]
*  thing for a person to be paid [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=13.32s)]
*  millions of dollars a year to say, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=14.82s)]
*  but lesbians exist and [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=16.72s)]
*  that continues to bother Charlie [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=17.96s)]
*  Kirk on a very deep level. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=19.8s)]
*  He's never going to actually [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=22.44s)]
*  articulate because he can't [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=23.44s)]
*  articulate how someone being [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=24.46s)]
*  a lesbian would mean that they're [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=25.66s)]
*  not capable of running [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=27.0s)]
*  a fire department. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=27.88s)]
*  He is just assuming that the people [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=29.08s)]
*  he screeches at every day will [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=30.88s)]
*  agree right off the bat that that [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=32.4s)]
*  is true. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=34.08s)]
*  And if they're not lesbians, then [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=35.08s)]
*  God help us if they were black or [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=36.64s)]
*  Hispanic or something, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=38.08s)]
*  he would have an automatic problem [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=39.26s)]
*  with that too. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=40.839999999999996s)]
*  And so Donald Trump should do, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=41.64s)]
*  according to Charlie Kirk, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=43.32s)]
*  what Donald Trump has said he'd do. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=44.8s)]
*  Which is because California is [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=46.68s)]
*  a blue state, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=48.76s)]
*  because LA is pretty liberal, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=49.8s)]
*  he should block them from getting [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=51.92s)]
*  aid unless they bend over [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=54.0s)]
*  backwards for him. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=55.68s)]
*  So Charlie Kirk is saying that [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=57.12s)]
*  Donald Trump should do to LA what [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=58.76s)]
*  no Democratic president would ever [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=60.839999999999996s)]
*  do to a red state, to a red city. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=63.28s)]
*  Perhaps that's experienced [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=66.72s)]
*  horrendous winter storms in [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=68.12s)]
*  the case of Texas or hurricanes in [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=69.56s)]
*  the case of North and South [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=71.4s)]
*  Carolina and Florida or again, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=72.76s)]
*  Texas. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=74.64s)]
*  If a train were to derail in a rural [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=76.16s)]
*  area where there's a lot of [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=78.12s)]
*  conservatives, no Democrat would [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=79.8s)]
*  ever manipulate those people. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=82.08s)]
*  No, what they would do, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=84.44s)]
*  what they do do, is they jump to it [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=85.8s)]
*  and they get them the aid that they [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=87.84s)]
*  need. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=89.72000000000001s)]
*  That's what every president should [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=90.22000000000001s)]
*  do. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=92.24000000000001s)]
*  Charlie Kirk wants to change that. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=92.88000000000001s)]
*  The norm should no longer be that [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=94.56s)]
*  everyone is deserving of the aid of [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=96.56s)]
*  the federal government. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=98.72000000000001s)]
*  Now, no, elections have [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=100.24000000000001s)]
*  consequences, and so your side gets [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=102.0s)]
*  aid and the other side doesn't. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=104.72s)]
*  What Charlie Kirk wants is, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=106.88000000000001s)]
*  in four years when the collective [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=108.48s)]
*  failures of the Trump [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=110.2s)]
*  administration almost necessarily [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=111.32000000000001s)]
*  result in the White House being [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=113.24000000000001s)]
*  taken by a Democrat, he wants that [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=114.80000000000001s)]
*  Democrat to be just as vindictive [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=116.68s)]
*  and biased and partisan when it [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=118.44s)]
*  comes to allocating federal aid [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=120.04s)]
*  under him as Donald Trump will be [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=121.68s)]
*  for the next four years. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=123.32s)]
*  And so conservatives are probably [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=124.84s)]
*  cheering for the bias that Charlie [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=126.44s)]
*  Kirk is advocating for right now. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=128.12s)]
*  But understand that he's setting [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=130.28s)]
*  the stage for the Democrats in [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=131.64s)]
*  theory to do the same thing to them [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=132.84s)]
*  in the future. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=134.16s)]
*  I think that's wrong. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=135.28s)]
*  I want everyone to get helped by [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=137.0s)]
*  the federal government. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=138.44s)]
*  Unfortunately, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=139.76s)]
*  Charlie Kirk doesn't see it that [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=140.26s)]
*  way. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=141.4s)]
*  Maz, I want to go to you. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=142.32s)]
*  You're in the LA area. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=143.72s)]
*  I'm sure you've seen a whole lot of [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=145.4s)]
*  right wingers attacking those in LA, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=147.32s)]
*  mocking people who've been [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=149.72s)]
*  struggling, implying that they [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=151.52s)]
*  deserve in some way their own [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=153.68s)]
*  suffering. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=155.56s)]
*  What do you make of all this? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=157.44s)]
*  Yeah, first of all, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=158.76s)]
*  the blame game, listen, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=159.92000000000002s)]
*  there will be people and things and [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=161.52s)]
*  climate change and other things to [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=163.68s)]
*  blame and look at and prepare, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=165.92000000000002s)]
*  hopefully, better for [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=167.84s)]
*  what's coming down the pike. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=169.20000000000002s)]
*  And it's going to happen, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=171.04000000000002s)]
*  this is now an annual thing, so [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=172.24s)]
*  I'll set that up a bit. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=173.92s)]
*  But the fact that they're jumping [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=175.16s)]
*  to this blame game at a time when [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=176.96s)]
*  people are suffering and [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=178.76s)]
*  they need to be showing sympathy [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=180.16s)]
*  and empathy and [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=182.04s)]
*  really coming together as a country. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=182.88s)]
*  That's the problem is there used to [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=185.32s)]
*  be a time when a tragedy happened, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=187.28s)]
*  both parties would come together as [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=189.24s)]
*  a country and they would be there [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=191.28s)]
*  for the victims. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=193.2s)]
*  Now, right away, Donald Trump from [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=194.4s)]
*  day one started in a derogatory [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=197.0s)]
*  fashion blaming Gavin Newsom. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=199.35999999999999s)]
*  He has this, his theory of [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=202.6s)]
*  clearing the brush and all that [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=204.28s)]
*  stuff. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=206.32s)]
*  Meanwhile, the Palisades fire was [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=208.0s)]
*  in a residential area, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=210.32s)]
*  wasn't in the woods, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=211.84s)]
*  I'm not sure where it got started. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=213.2s)]
*  But again, there's many things and [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=215.56s)]
*  issues to blame. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=218.32s)]
*  But these guys are going after [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=220.92s)]
*  their usual talking points. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=222.32s)]
*  The whole thing of the DEI hire and [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=223.79999999999998s)]
*  saying that the police chief who's [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=225.79999999999998s)]
*  a female is incompetent. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=227.76s)]
*  I mean, Jesse Waters, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=229.56s)]
*  there was a clip of him saying [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=230.56s)]
*  something along those lines about, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=231.72s)]
*  I hope these women that are running [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=233.68s)]
*  this fire department know what [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=235.0s)]
*  they're doing. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=236.28s)]
*  Basically saying you have to be [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=237.12s)]
*  only white males should be firemen. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=238.56s)]
*  That's what they think. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=241.88s)]
*  And if they were firemen, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=242.68s)]
*  they would have saved us. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=243.68s)]
*  And if we had a Republican governor, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=244.96s)]
*  he would have saved us. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=247.08s)]
*  I mean, it's just all this mumbo [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=248.44s)]
*  jumbo, this whole thing of Donald [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=250.12s)]
*  Trump talking about like, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=251.52s)]
*  Gavin Newsom is not bringing water [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=252.92000000000002s)]
*  to Southern California because he's [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=255.4s)]
*  trying to save the Delta smelt, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=256.64s)]
*  which is a fish that has a funny [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=259.68s)]
*  name, Delta smelt. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=263.64s)]
*  But that's not true. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=265.52s)]
*  They just they say things that [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=267.2s)]
*  aren't true. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=268.40000000000003s)]
*  And part of it is they really do [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=269.6s)]
*  this thing of like, if you [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=272.52s)]
*  remember, I think it was when [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=274.04s)]
*  there was hurricanes of Florida or [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=276.0s)]
*  something and Trump came out and [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=277.52s)]
*  said, Biden's not going to send [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=279.16s)]
*  relief because it's a red state. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=280.88s)]
*  They do this thing where they [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=282.84000000000003s)]
*  project what they the way they [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=286.32s)]
*  act onto the other party. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=288.96s)]
*  Same thing when they say, oh, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=292.2s)]
*  Biden was weaponizing the DOJ. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=293.64s)]
*  And now Trump is saying, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=296.0s)]
*  I want to go after my opponents. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=297.0s)]
*  And so similarly, when we're here [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=300.28s)]
*  and Charlie Kirk is saying, oh, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=302.92s)]
*  he should withhold this money. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=304.96s)]
*  It is ridiculous. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=306.64s)]
*  It is divisive. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=307.8s)]
*  And by the way, California taxes [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=309.56s)]
*  pay for a lot of what happens [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=311.8s)]
*  in a lot of these red states, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=314.88s)]
*  meaning their benefits and [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=316.16s)]
*  all that stuff. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=318.04s)]
*  The amount that we contribute to [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=319.0s)]
*  the economy is so big that, hey, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=321.48s)]
*  two can play this game. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=324.04s)]
*  Don't give us a relief. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=326.28000000000003s)]
*  We won't give you our, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=327.6s)]
*  we'll just keep all our taxes and [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=328.6s)]
*  you can go on your own. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=330.08000000000004s)]
*  I mean, Charlie Kirk is [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=331.36s)]
*  a real stupid idiot. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=332.52000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, nice. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=333.68s)]
*  The tone changed there at [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=337.64000000000004s)]
*  the end, but- [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=339.64000000000004s)]
*  You threw me off a little bit. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=340.88s)]
*  What to me, I went around and [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=343.32000000000005s)]
*  finally I was like, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=344.72s)]
*  that's what I meant to say. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=346.12s)]
*  Thank you. I'm glad you got there [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=348.08s)]
*  eventually, Maz. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=349.52s)]
*  But I don't care what sexual [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=350.32s)]
*  orientation or race or gender [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=352.0s)]
*  identity someone has or is. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=353.76s)]
*  I literally just care whether or [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=355.4s)]
*  not they can do the job and [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=357.36s)]
*  if they can do their job well, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=359.0s)]
*  right? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=360.92s)]
*  But Trump has already said that he [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=361.44s)]
*  wouldn't give aid to California to [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=363.2s)]
*  fight wildfires because he just [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=365.15999999999997s)]
*  wants to stick it to Gavin Newsom [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=366.88s)]
*  because, as Maz mentioned, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=368.76s)]
*  they're having a dispute over [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=370.56s)]
*  the Delta smelt. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=372.32s)]
*  But conservatives who follow and [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=373.32s)]
*  admire people like Charlie Kirk [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=375.28s)]
*  are, I think, to Maz's point, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=377.23999999999995s)]
*  just not smart people. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=379.11999999999995s)]
*  And they're probably not very nice [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=380.4s)]
*  people because nice people don't [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=382.0s)]
*  say things like this. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=383.67999999999995s)]
*  They don't want these things for [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=384.88s)]
*  other people. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=386.47999999999996s)]
*  They don't look at people who are [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=387.44s)]
*  suffering and think, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=388.84s)]
*  that's probably your fault. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=389.88s)]
*  Look, if they want to have [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=391.47999999999996s)]
*  a real conversation, if they want [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=392.76s)]
*  to talk about the failings of [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=394.44s)]
*  the Democratic Party, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=395.79999999999995s)]
*  the Democrats will be the first [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=397.08s)]
*  ones to tell them. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=398.67999999999995s)]
*  We will happily tell you what is [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=399.64s)]
*  wrong with the Democratic Party. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=401.03999999999996s)]
*  We're not happy with the party's [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=402.59999999999997s)]
*  leadership right now. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=404.08s)]
*  We're not happy about the direction [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=405.12s)]
*  of the party or of the country. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=406.92s)]
*  We can have that conversation with [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=409.0s)]
*  them, but whatever they're doing, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=410.96s)]
*  no, I don't want to talk to them. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=413.02s)]
*  I don't want to talk about that. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=415.08s)]
*  I don't want to even be around [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=416.28000000000003s)]
*  someone who thinks and [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=417.72s)]
*  feels these things. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=418.84000000000003s)]
*  And this is where I think the crux [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=420.08s)]
*  of the divide happens in this [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=422.24s)]
*  country between the two parties is [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=424.12s)]
*  like I'm really turned off by these [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=426.36s)]
*  people because they say things that [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=428.44s)]
*  I feel are not decent things that [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=430.52s)]
*  decent people would ever say. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=432.44s)]
*  They think about us on this side [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=434.32s)]
*  for some reason. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=435.92s)]
*  Yeah, despite the fact that again, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=437.24s)]
*  we don't do it. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=438.8s)]
*  We don't do it. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=439.64s)]
*  And I agree, I want us to continue [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=440.36s)]
*  to be decent. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=442.36s)]
*  We could do the exact same thing [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=443.32s)]
*  that they're doing. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=445.71999999999997s)]
*  They're like, well, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=447.4s)]
*  California's got a fire, so [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=448.71999999999997s)]
*  obviously it's those goddamn [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=450.44s)]
*  lesbians in charge. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=452.2s)]
*  Or maybe if it's not the lesbians [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=453.48s)]
*  then it's Gavin Newsom. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=455.12s)]
*  Gavin Newsom better resign because [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=456.4s)]
*  he was the governor when there was [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=457.96s)]
*  a big fire and obviously when [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=459.52s)]
*  there's a big fire as a governor, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=460.84s)]
*  you resign. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=462.44s)]
*  That's why Greg Abbott resigned [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=463.08000000000004s)]
*  last year when Texas experienced [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=464.72s)]

*  I'm outie 5000. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=477.40000000000003s)]
*  You remember everybody when that [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=478.40000000000003s)]
*  happened? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=479.8s)]
*  No, I don't remember. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=480.32000000000005s)]
*  And they received aid. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=481.56s)]
*  But honestly, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=482.84000000000003s)]
*  they probably shouldn't. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=483.44s)]
*  Biden should have said, no, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=484.32000000000005s)]
*  you guys keep making these [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=485.72s)]
*  mistakes. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=486.96000000000004s)]
*  You do that separate power grid [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=487.56s)]
*  thing and that's why you have [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=489.12s)]
*  brownouts throughout the summer and [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=490.6s)]
*  don't winterize your electricity. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=492.56s)]
*  So that's why you lose power during [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=494.24s)]
*  the winter. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=495.76s)]
*  So we'll give you aid once you [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=496.32s)]
*  re hook up to the national power [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=497.88s)]
*  grid, because we all act like that. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=499.47999999999996s)]
*  We could do that. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=501.47999999999996s)]
*  We could say we're not giving [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=503.15999999999997s)]
*  Florida hurricane aid until they [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=504.76s)]
*  clear out coastal areas. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=506.56s)]
*  Shut down Mar-a-Lago. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=507.91999999999996s)]
*  It's too much of a risk. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=509.2s)]
*  It's going to cost too much money [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=510.24s)]
*  when it gets destroyed. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=511.44s)]
*  So you got to clear all that out [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=512.68s)]
*  and then maybe we'll give you [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=513.96s)]
*  hurricane aid. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=515.1999999999999s)]
*  Now we won't do that because we are [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=516.0799999999999s)]
*  decent, but we could. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=517.88s)]
*  And every time we get pushed around [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=520.52s)]
*  this, I think more and [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=521.8399999999999s)]
*  more Democrats think maybe we [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=522.76s)]
*  should try doing it the other way. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDYThBlz94&t=523.92s)]
