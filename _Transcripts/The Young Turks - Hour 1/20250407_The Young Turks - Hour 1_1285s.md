TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.

# Dave Portnoy TEARS Into Trump Over HUGE Loss Of Net Worth In Market Crash
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [April 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8)
*  The last three days coming into [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=0.0s)]
*  today has just been not good. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=3.6s)]
*  I went super viral when I said I [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=8.2s)]
*  lost $7 million. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=9.98s)]
*  I'd kill to be back to losing $7 [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=11.22s)]
*  million. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=13.98s)]
*  I haven't even looked if I had to [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=14.82s)]
*  guess them down in these last three [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=17.22s)]
*  days probably close to 20. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=20.02s)]
*  I don't know, like 10, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=22.46s)]
*  15% of my net worth, poof. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=24.1s)]
*  I hate that I'm losing all this [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=26.22s)]
*  money. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=27.900000000000002s)]
*  He's come up with this thing. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=28.42s)]
*  Don't join the panicky party, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=29.94s)]
*  the panicking party, very funny. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=31.72s)]
*  Even with the stock market in [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=33.94s)]
*  absolute shambles, it appears that [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=35.96s)]
*  President Donald Trump is undeterred [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  from implementing his tariffs [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=40.96s)]
*  policy. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=42.76s)]
*  And we're going to get back to [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=43.64s)]
*  Portnoy, Dave Portnoy in just [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=45.2s)]
*  a moment. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=46.86s)]
*  Of course, an avid Trump supporter [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=47.36s)]
*  who has now maybe reconsidered his [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=49.68s)]
*  decision to be such a vocal [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=51.82s)]
*  proponent of Trump's. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=53.46s)]
*  And if you're an American who's [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=55.74s)]
*  panicking, well, the president [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=57.38s)]
*  has decided to stop being weak and [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=59.040000000000006s)]
*  stupid. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=60.88s)]
*  This is what he conveyed on [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=61.46s)]
*  Truth Social today, Cenk. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  He writes, the United States has [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=65.04s)]
*  a chance to do something that [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=66.68s)]
*  should have been done decades ago. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=68.08s)]
*  Don't be weak, don't be stupid. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=69.78s)]
*  Don't be a panicking, a new party [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=71.76s)]
*  based on weak and stupid people. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=73.92s)]
*  Be strong, courageous, and [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=76.88s)]
*  patient, and [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=78.30000000000001s)]
*  greatness will be the result. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=79.02000000000001s)]
*  I will give him credit for panicking [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=80.4s)]
*  because oftentimes he takes [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=82.44s)]
*  ownership of words that he hasn't [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=84.14s)]
*  come up with. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=86.12s)]
*  But in this case, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=87.46s)]
*  congratulations, Trump. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=88.36s)]
*  You did come up with that word. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=89.53999999999999s)]
*  Well done. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=90.82s)]
*  Well, let's see if it sticks. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=91.32s)]
*  Okay, so first of all, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=92.5s)]
*  I was given to understand that no [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=93.82s)]
*  Trump voter would ever break. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=95.86s)]
*  No Trump person in the media would [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=97.94s)]
*  ever dissent. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=99.78s)]
*  I was told they were all 100% [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=100.82s)]
*  occult, and there should be no [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=102.42s)]
*  conversations with them only [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=104.06s)]
*  yelling. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=105.6s)]
*  Interestingly, Portnoy turned on [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=106.58s)]
*  not just Trump, but [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=108.38s)]
*  Will Cain from Fox News and [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=109.3s)]
*  Clay Travis. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=110.58s)]
*  And let's be honest, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=111.7s)]
*  between Portnoy and Clay Travis, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=112.78s)]
*  no one even knew that they were two [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=114.7s)]
*  separate people until now. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=116.5s)]
*  But it turns out they're opposed to [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=118.36s)]
*  one another, at least in this [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=120.08s)]
*  particular case. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=121.5s)]
*  And what's most important, guys, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=122.44s)]
*  is that some set of independent [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=124.74s)]
*  media folks that supported Trump [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=126.84s)]
*  are now calling BS on the other [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=129.08s)]
*  guys. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=131.12s)]
*  And so when they were lockstep and [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=132.64s)]
*  it was just Fox News and [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=134.6s)]
*  they had a monopoly on talking [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=135.92000000000002s)]
*  points and no one ever broke. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=137.72s)]
*  But now, Portnoy's going, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=139.96s)]
*  you guys sound like idiots when you [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=141.56s)]
*  tell me that this was all planned [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=143.52s)]
*  and us shaving off 20% of our net [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=145.5s)]
*  wealth was some sort of genius [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=147.46s)]
*  strategy. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=149.20000000000002s)]
*  And that we should just stick to [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=150.18s)]
*  the talking points about how other [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=151.84s)]
*  people are panicking. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=153.66s)]
*  No, I'm not going to do that [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=155.38s)]
*  because that's really dumb. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=156.44s)]
*  So we're going to get back to more [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=157.54000000000002s)]
*  of what he had to say in just [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=159.14000000000001s)]
*  a moment. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=160.5s)]
*  But before we do, just to make sure [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=161.1s)]
*  we're all on the same page, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=163.5s)]
*  as of this morning, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=165.34s)]
*  the Dow was down 1,300 points. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=166.58s)]
*  In fact, today marked the third [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=169.58s)]
*  straight day of declines. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=171.26s)]
*  And on top of that, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=172.74s)]
*  the S&P 500 officially entered bear [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=174.20000000000002s)]
*  territory, so no longer a bull [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=176.64000000000001s)]
*  market. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=178.56s)]
*  The initial 10% baseline tariff, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=179.36s)]
*  which is of course part of Trump's [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=181.96s)]
*  tariff policy took effect at USC [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=184.36s)]
*  ports, airports, and [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=186.6s)]
*  customs warehouses on Thursday of [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=188.06s)]
*  last week, higher taxes on goods [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=190.4s)]
*  from 57 larger trading partners are [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=192.48000000000002s)]
*  set to start later this week. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=194.96s)]
*  Now, Trump was asked, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=197.76000000000002s)]
*  what's going on, bro? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=199.16s)]
*  Are you planning on negotiating for [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=200.64000000000001s)]
*  better trade deals and you're using [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=202.78s)]
*  the threat of these tariffs as [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=204.79999999999998s)]
*  a negotiating tool, or are you for [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=206.42s)]
*  real, are these the tariffs that [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=208.29999999999998s)]
*  will remain in place? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=210.1s)]
*  And he basically told reporters [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=211.66s)]

*  a little bit of both, okay? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=216.66s)]
*  So basically, he is looking to [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=217.94s)]
*  negotiate trade deals with some [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=219.68s)]

*  tariffs he believes will remain in [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=223.42s)]
*  place and will be permanent. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=225.64s)]
*  But look, Trump is a man with [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=228.06s)]
*  a plan, any more whining from China [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=229.78s)]
*  and he'll hit him with even [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=232.08s)]

*  I think you should triple those [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=369.52s)]
*  tariffs against Israel, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=371.02s)]

*  Yeah, no, okay, to be fair, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=373.24s)]
*  Israel brought their tariffs down [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=375.06s)]

*  But of course, Israel is the first [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=379.66s)]
*  to get in the door and [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=381.42s)]
*  you get the negotiations. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=382.38s)]
*  Now Trump didn't give into him [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=383.78000000000003s)]
*  right away on the tariffs, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=385.1s)]
*  I'll give him credit on that. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=386.22s)]
*  On the other hand, he later [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=387.86s)]
*  promised again for the US to [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=389.74s)]
*  control and own Gaza and to clear [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=391.74s)]

*  Gaza. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=396.1s)]
*  So of course, still serving [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=396.6s)]
*  Israel through and through. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=398.34000000000003s)]
*  So now, onto the back of the [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=400.3s)]
*  tariffs, when if he does that 50% [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=401.90000000000003s)]
*  extra mental tariff on China, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=404.12s)]

*  Phase two is when it hits you in [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=419.16s)]

*  yet. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=423.52000000000004s)]

*  these tariffs stay, the prices go [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=425.8s)]
*  up and then it goes into the market, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=427.92s)]
*  then you're going to see real anger. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=430.04s)]
*  because right now this is affecting [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=433.02s)]
*  the top 10% more than anyone else. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=434.66s)]
*  Yes, retirement accounts, etc. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=436.38s)]

*  lose your job or not. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=440.54s)]

*  When it does, then it's going to be [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=444.82s)]
*  political armageddon. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=446.74s)]

*  listen to any panicans or [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=450.02s)]

*  We can't afford to have the market [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=483.4s)]
*  stumble too much more. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=485.03999999999996s)]
*  We can't afford that, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=486.28s)]
*  to have these tariffs actually hit [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=487.28s)]
*  prices of goods and lose the jobs [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=489.0s)]
*  and lose the businesses. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=490.64s)]
*  So if they all gang up on us now [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=492.09999999999997s)]
*  economically, we're toast. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=494.58s)]
*  So I mean, cross your fingers that [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=497.3s)]
*  they don't do that. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=500.08s)]
*  But Trump has opened up us up to [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=501.46s)]
*  disaster if the rest of the world [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=503.65999999999997s)]

*  I'm going to okay, so look, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=507.65999999999997s)]
*  I partially agree with you. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=509.18s)]
*  But I think part of the reason why [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=510.97999999999996s)]
*  they're not ganging up on us is [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=512.56s)]
*  that we have 330 million people in [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=514.06s)]
*  the United States. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=515.9s)]
*  It's a massive country with [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=517.1s)]
*  a lot of consumers. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=518.66s)]
*  And a lot of these smaller [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=520.06s)]
*  countries rely on us to- [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=521.48s)]
*  No, obviously. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=523.12s)]
*  Keep their businesses afloat. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=524.0400000000001s)]
*  No, but let me explain. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=525.76s)]
*  So it's a good question. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=527.08s)]
*  So look, if we're to picking on [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=528.52s)]
*  a one by one, us versus Estonia, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=530.52s)]
*  they have no chance they're going [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=532.48s)]
*  to have to give into whatever [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=534.36s)]
*  demand we have us versus Mexico, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=535.9200000000001s)]
*  us versus Canada as long as it's [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=537.72s)]
*  contained our economic might is [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=539.52s)]
*  massive, not just because of 330 [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=541.2800000000001s)]
*  million people, because our GDP per [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=543.2s)]
*  capita is sky high, we spend more [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=545.2s)]
*  than anyone else, anyone else is [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=547.12s)]
*  not close, right? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=549.0s)]
*  On the other hand, if China and [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=550.7s)]
*  the EU and Japan and South Korea [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=553.0600000000001s)]
*  were all, let alone India, Bricks, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=555.4200000000001s)]
*  all those other folks who are not [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=558.1s)]
*  our enemies, China you could have [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=560.38s)]
*  an economic conversation about [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=562.5s)]
*  whether we're opposed to them. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=564.4200000000001s)]
*  But all these folks, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=566.34s)]
*  there's no war or [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=567.46s)]
*  anything like that. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=568.1800000000001s)]
*  They could easily unite and go, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=568.94s)]
*  okay, now we're going to do [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=570.7800000000001s)]
*  reciprocal back at them. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=572.1800000000001s)]
*  And if they all do reciprocal back [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=573.7800000000001s)]
*  at us, which would be a very [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=575.62s)]
*  logical move, we would be [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=577.0s)]
*  devastated. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=578.3000000000001s)]
*  So any one of them by themselves, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=579.4s)]
*  we have leverage and [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=581.5s)]
*  we can use that to bring down their [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=582.56s)]
*  tariffs or anything like that. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=584.52s)]
*  But China has well over 1.2 billion [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=586.76s)]
*  people, they're four times our [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=589.4399999999999s)]
*  size. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=591.68s)]
*  And they used to be poverty [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=592.36s)]
*  stricken several decades ago, but [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=593.68s)]
*  now they have a roaring middle [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=595.6s)]
*  class. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=597.16s)]
*  So you could easily make deals with [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=598.16s)]
*  them, Europe is pretty much our [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=599.64s)]
*  size, you could easily make deals [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=601.0s)]
*  with them. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=602.46s)]
*  We are playing with fire here, but [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=603.16s)]
*  a worldwide fire. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=605.04s)]
*  But so Anna, that gets to [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=606.48s)]
*  the main point, which is, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=607.52s)]
*  look, I asked this on social media [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=609.5s)]
*  earlier today and now finally [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=611.38s)]
*  reporters have started asking it [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=613.0400000000001s)]
*  too, because it's a logical and [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=614.86s)]
*  obvious question, which is, wait, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=616.5s)]
*  are these tariffs meant to stay for [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=618.62s)]
*  a long time and rebuild our [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=620.72s)]
*  manufacturing base? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=622.3000000000001s)]
*  Or are they a negotiating ploy to [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=624.94s)]
*  bring tariffs down and [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=627.1s)]
*  then they're going to go away soon? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=628.64s)]
*  So which one is it? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=631.34s)]
*  And he hasn't answered that [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=633.62s)]
*  question. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=634.78s)]
*  You're right. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=635.34s)]
*  And it can't be both. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=635.86s)]
*  You can't say, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=637.26s)]
*  I did it as a negotiating ploy and [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=638.12s)]
*  I got these amazing new deals, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=639.8000000000001s)]
*  including 0% from some countries. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=641.34s)]
*  And mission accomplished, so [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=643.84s)]
*  I took the tariffs off. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=645.16s)]
*  And that's why the tariffs will [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=646.48s)]
*  reignite our manufacturing base. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=647.72s)]
*  Wait, did you take them off or [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=649.5600000000001s)]
*  did you not take them off? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=650.52s)]
*  Are they short term or [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=651.9200000000001s)]
*  are they long term? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=652.76s)]
*  And he's not clarifying because he [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=653.88s)]
*  wants the best of both worlds, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=655.52s)]
*  he's just throwing out [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=656.8000000000001s)]
*  both talking points. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=657.72s)]
*  I'll tell you what I think he's [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=659.16s)]
*  going to actually do, but go ahead. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=660.16s)]
*  No, I mean, look, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=661.48s)]
*  I've said this before, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=662.36s)]
*  I'm going to say it again. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=663.48s)]
*  What he's doing right now with [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=664.88s)]
*  slapping tariffs on every single [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=666.38s)]
*  country and really upping the ante [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=668.22s)]
*  with some of our closest trade [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=670.14s)]
*  partners and allies is ridiculous. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=671.86s)]
*  However, the thing that frustrates [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=673.9s)]
*  me the most about all of this is [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=675.94s)]
*  that it actually is a good idea to [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=677.58s)]
*  do some targeted tariffs, right? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=679.48s)]
*  It is a good idea, both for [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=681.94s)]
*  our national security and for [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=683.42s)]
*  the well-being of our country to [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=685.26s)]
*  produce certain things here in [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=687.1s)]
*  the United States, pharmaceutical [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=688.98s)]
*  drugs being one example. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=691.0600000000001s)]
*  The problem is with the way that [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=692.5s)]
*  Trump is handling this, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=694.02s)]
*  we're not worried that that window [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=695.4399999999999s)]
*  for targeted tariffs will just be [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=697.4s)]
*  diminished, will disappear because [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=699.4399999999999s)]
*  of what it's doing to the economy, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=701.64s)]
*  right? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=703.5999999999999s)]
*  Look, it hasn't hit the real [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=704.1999999999999s)]
*  economy yet. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=705.8s)]
*  Of course, it's hit the stock [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=706.88s)]
*  market, but we all know what would [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=708.4s)]
*  happen if this continues, right? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=710.16s)]
*  These companies are going to stop [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=713.24s)]
*  investing in their own businesses. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=714.68s)]

*  So I'm very concerned about that. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=725.4599999999999s)]
*  But that's not to say that some [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=728.06s)]
*  targeted tariffs make sense, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=730.02s)]
*  because some things absolutely [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=731.8199999999999s)]
*  should be produced here in [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=733.62s)]
*  the United States for our own [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=735.06s)]
*  well-being and national security. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=736.56s)]
*  Now, if you're denying that these [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=738.3s)]
*  blanket tariffs that Trump has [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=740.6999999999999s)]
*  implemented are disastrous, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=742.9799999999999s)]
*  why don't we hear from Russian [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=745.3s)]
*  state media? [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=747.38s)]
*  Because they are absolutely [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=748.9399999999999s)]
*  celebrating what Trump is doing. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=750.66s)]
*  So on Russian state media, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=753.12s)]
*  there's a political scientist by [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=755.08s)]
*  the name of Dmitry Kulikov, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=757.72s)]
*  who said the following, quote, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=759.86s)]
*  the price of goods will certainly [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=762.1600000000001s)]
*  go up in the United States. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=764.1600000000001s)]
*  The old political and [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=766.0s)]
*  economic global system is [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=767.32s)]
*  practically dead. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=769.0400000000001s)]
*  Sounds pretty celebratory. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=770.5600000000001s)]
*  The host of this state sponsored [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=772.48s)]
*  Russian news show, Vladimir Solovyov, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=775.36s)]
*  says the following. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=778.88s)]
*  A monument should be erected to [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=781.8399999999999s)]
*  Trump. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=783.4599999999999s)]
*  This was a major blow to [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=784.14s)]
*  the system of capitalism. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=785.42s)]
*  I think he deserves at least [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=786.8199999999999s)]
*  a Sutulov medal. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=788.8199999999999s)]
*  And a Sutulov medal is basically [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=790.86s)]
*  not a prestigious medal at all. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=792.8399999999999s)]
*  It's a gag gift. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=794.8199999999999s)]
*  The Daily Beast described it as [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=796.42s)]
*  a worthless award that a master [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=797.98s)]
*  gives his servants. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=799.5s)]
*  But he went further saying, quote, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=801.14s)]
*  to deliver this kind of blow, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=803.3s)]
*  well done, old man. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=804.86s)]
*  I mean, Ronald Reagan's got to be [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=806.8199999999999s)]
*  spinning in his grave. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=809.48s)]
*  So here's the Russians celebrating [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=811.36s)]
*  that a Republican president is [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=813.84s)]
*  helping to kill off capitalism. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=816.12s)]
*  And well done, old man. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=818.64s)]
*  Now look, you could take that [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=820.36s)]
*  any way you want. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=821.76s)]
*  You don't have to get into [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=822.6s)]
*  Russia, Russia, Russia. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=823.98s)]
*  It's just interesting that they're [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=825.32s)]
*  so positive in Russia that this is [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=827.96s)]
*  disastrous for America. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=830.24s)]
*  That they're openly celebrating on [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=832.2800000000001s)]
*  air. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=834.64s)]
*  And remember, nothing goes on air [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=835.72s)]
*  without Putin approving it, right? [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=837.1600000000001s)]
*  So this is the Russian government [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=838.86s)]
*  rubbing it in our face. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=840.7s)]
*  Ha ha, your president is helping to [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=842.0600000000001s)]
*  kill off your country and [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=844.34s)]
*  we love it, okay? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=845.9s)]
*  Meanwhile, Trump, Putin, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=848.0600000000001s)]
*  are you okay, Putin? [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=849.7s)]
*  Okay, I don't know why he does it. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=851.02s)]
*  But the fact that he does do it is [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=852.86s)]
*  pretty clear. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=854.5s)]
*  So now, look, let me clarify two [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=855.22s)]
*  numbers before I get back to, yes, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=857.4200000000001s)]
*  but what should we do? [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=859.96s)]
*  Number one, the Dow started off at [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=862.26s)]
*  1300 down. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=864.6600000000001s)]
*  Now it ended around 400 down. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=865.98s)]
*  So recovered a little bit, but [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=868.76s)]
*  again, people are still super [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=870.24s)]
*  worried about how volatile it is, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=871.7s)]
*  wobbly it is, and the fact that it's [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=873.36s)]
*  still headed down. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=875.0s)]
*  Number two, I want to go back to [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=875.8s)]
*  Portnoy for a second. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=877.28s)]
*  Wait, 20 million is 10 to 15% of [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=878.48s)]
*  your net worth? [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=881.08s)]
*  Holy cow, so [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=883.44s)]
*  he's got about $200 million. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=884.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=885.8s)]
*  You got to be I. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=886.3s)]
*  You got to be I. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=887.24s)]
*  Okay, interesting. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=888.08s)]
*  And it's amazing that he's learning. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=889.52s)]
*  But I can understand the, I mean, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=891.04s)]
*  20 million's a lot of money. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=892.64s)]
*  Yeah, the back and forth with his [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=894.2s)]
*  purchase of his company and [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=895.6s)]
*  then him getting it back is public. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=896.76s)]
*  So I don't blame him for [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=898.02s)]
*  sharing it, but it is amazing, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=899.02s)]
*  right? [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=900.22s)]
*  That they throw around those [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=900.74s)]
*  numbers. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=901.86s)]
*  All right, now back to important [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=902.36s)]
*  stuff. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=903.78s)]
*  So guys, which one should it be? [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=904.3s)]
*  Should it be permanent and [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=905.94s)]
*  it helps rebuild manufacturing? [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=907.54s)]
*  Should it be temporary because [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=909.74s)]
*  negotiating deals, etc.? [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=911.58s)]
*  Now, if it was targeted, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=913.54s)]
*  it should be permanent, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=914.94s)]
*  as Ana said. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=916.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=916.86s)]
*  Okay, but they're not targeted, so [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=917.38s)]
*  they're thrown out at all countries [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=919.74s)]
*  and all industries, etc. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=921.98s)]
*  So since that is damaging, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=923.86s)]
*  I would say our best case scenario [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=926.44s)]
*  is he tries to save face by [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=929.0s)]
*  negotiating a couple of deals. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=930.88s)]
*  I made a deal with Israel that [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=933.64s)]
*  already had tariffs at 0%. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=935.08s)]
*  I made a deal with EU, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=936.44s)]
*  maybe it is a good deal, then I'll [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=937.74s)]
*  take it and I'm happy, right? [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=939.48s)]
*  And then if he takes all of these [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=941.28s)]
*  off and got us a couple of [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=943.28s)]
*  negotiated deals for [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=944.94s)]
*  a little bit lower tariffs, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=946.52s)]
*  it was not the right way to do it. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=948.52s)]
*  And it will still will have [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=950.6800000000001s)]
*  significant consequences for [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=952.08s)]
*  the significant downturn and [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=953.9200000000001s)]
*  might lead to a recession. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=955.66s)]
*  But at least we'll get something [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=956.98s)]
*  positive out of it and be done with [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=958.56s)]
*  these ridiculous nuclear tariffs, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=960.34s)]
*  right? [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=962.36s)]
*  So that's what I would prefer, but [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=962.86s)]
*  because he's not smart and [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=965.4399999999999s)]
*  strategic enough to do well placed [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=967.4s)]
*  industry specific tariffs, [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=969.86s)]
*  he's just not capable of it, right? [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=971.86s)]
*  And so by the way, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=974.6999999999999s)]
*  if you're pro tariff, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=975.6999999999999s)]
*  this is terrible news for you. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=976.92s)]
*  because everyone's going to despise [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=978.74s)]
*  tariffs after this. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=980.3s)]
*  So good luck doing your strategic [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=981.38s)]
*  tariffs going forward. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=982.66s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I'm trying to get [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=983.38s)]
*  to. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=984.7s)]
*  I'm trying to communicate, right? [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=985.22s)]
*  There are tariffs that make sense. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=987.82s)]
*  Those tariffs are never going to be [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=990.1800000000001s)]
*  done now, right? [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=991.62s)]
*  That's the frustration here. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=992.26s)]
*  Now with that in mind, let's hear [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=994.38s)]
*  more from Portnoy because this hour [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=996.1400000000001s)]
*  long video was incredible. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=997.9000000000001s)]
*  You're going to get another snippet [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=999.1400000000001s)]
*  of it right here. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1000.74s)]
*  Even I'm not in the Panekin party, [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1001.74s)]
*  all right? [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1003.5s)]
*  I hate this. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1004.1800000000001s)]
*  I hate that I lost 20 million. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1005.26s)]
*  I didn't love seeing him on [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1007.0600000000001s)]
*  the golf course playing his course [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1008.38s)]
*  championship and being like, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1010.1400000000001s)]
*  I'm a very low handicap. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1011.7800000000001s)]
*  I didn't love that. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1013.22s)]
*  The stock market is being crushed. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1014.88s)]
*  I've lost 20% of my net worth. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1017.16s)]
*  And year out on the golf course. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1021.28s)]
*  In my mind, Donald Trump just cost [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1023.0799999999999s)]
*  me 20 million or whatever he did. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1025.12s)]
*  Maybe don't be on the golf course [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1027.84s)]
*  because I'm curled up in a ball and [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1029.4s)]
*  bed sweating. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1031.16s)]
*  So would I care about this if I [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1032.36s)]
*  wasn't rich? [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1034.24s)]
*  Maybe not as much, but [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1035.08s)]
*  I firmly believe if the stock [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1037.16s)]
*  market is down and crashing, [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1039.68s)]
*  the whole economy, [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1042.1s)]
*  it's all intertwined. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1044.06s)]
*  And it is, it is all intertwined. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1046.78s)]
*  Now right now, the people you hear [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1048.6599999999999s)]
*  whining the most are people who are [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1050.6999999999998s)]
*  heavily invested in the stock [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1052.6999999999998s)]
*  market, a lot of rich people, [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1054.3799999999999s)]
*  a lot of billionaires are worried [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1055.98s)]
*  about what's going on right now, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1057.78s)]
*  including by the way, Elon Musk. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1059.46s)]
*  And we're going to get to some of [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1061.22s)]
*  the infighting involving Elon Musk [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1062.74s)]
*  in just a moment. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1064.6999999999998s)]
*  But look, this is going to create [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1065.82s)]
*  some really severe cracks in [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1067.6599999999999s)]
*  the Trump administration. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1069.32s)]
*  Also, for the Republican Party, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1071.08s)]
*  because now you have a group of [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1073.04s)]
*  Republican senators who are like, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1074.78s)]
*  yeah, so you know that whole thing [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1077.0s)]
*  that we did where Congress ceded [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1079.06s)]
*  power to the executive branch? [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1080.96s)]
*  It turns out we don't like that so [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1083.84s)]
*  much. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1085.3s)]
*  I think that we should get back to [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1085.8s)]
*  a day where Congress made [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1087.56s)]
*  the decision about tariffs. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1088.8799999999999s)]
*  So we'll see what happens. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1090.56s)]
*  Tons of Republicans are now [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1092.0s)]
*  peeling off and there's too many of [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1093.2s)]
*  them for Trump to threaten them one [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1094.7s)]
*  at a time. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1096.12s)]
*  Just like the trading partners, [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1097.1599999999999s)]
*  he took on too much at once. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1099.26s)]
*  So now Rand Paul's hitting him, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1101.26s)]
*  Senator Kennedy from Louisiana's [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1103.18s)]
*  hitting him, the guy who's like, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1105.18s)]
*  that's my ass, right? [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1106.98s)]
*  And that's exactly what he's [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1108.6200000000001s)]
*  worried about now, his own ass. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1110.14s)]
*  So they're all over TV going, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1111.66s)]
*  I don't know about these tariffs. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1113.38s)]
*  Now, Elon Musk's not sure about [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1115.74s)]
*  the tariffs, [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1117.34s)]
*  Bill Ackman not sure about [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1117.98s)]
*  the tariffs. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1119.3s)]
*  So it's falling apart at the same [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1120.3s)]
*  time. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1121.6200000000001s)]
*  I thought they were never going to [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1122.14s)]
*  break, interesting. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1123.54s)]
*  So look guys, Wong John, I think, [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1125.3s)]
*  one of our members on tyt.com has [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1127.56s)]
*  a good line here that I like. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1130.04s)]
*  So this is the part we call [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1132.3999999999999s)]
*  finding out, okay? [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1134.2s)]
*  So and that's exactly right. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1135.68s)]
*  Trump thought he's above it. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1138.6s)]
*  And there's reports from [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1140.48s)]
*  the inside saying that he thinks [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1141.78s)]
*  he's not listening to anybody [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1143.44s)]
*  anymore. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1145.04s)]
*  And he thinks that his advisors [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1145.56s)]
*  were the problem first time around. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1147.2s)]
*  Brother, they were the reason that [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1149.1599999999999s)]
*  you managed to have an interesting [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1150.76s)]
*  balance in the economy. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1152.24s)]
*  Now without those professionals [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1153.32s)]
*  advice, he's just doing dumb stuff [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1156.02s)]
*  and finding out. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1158.5s)]
*  And so, but the bottom line on [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1159.8999999999999s)]
*  the overall panic is I'm absolutely [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1162.7s)]
*  positive that these tariffs will [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1165.7s)]
*  not be around, okay? [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1168.54s)]
*  So that's a strong statement. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1170.78s)]
*  There's a lot of folks, [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1173.98s)]
*  especially on the right wing who [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1174.86s)]
*  say no way, they're going to be [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1176.18s)]
*  around forever and ever. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1177.5s)]
*  And it's going to rebuild [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1178.7s)]
*  manufacturing and [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1179.7s)]
*  10 years from now. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1180.4199999999998s)]
*  We're going to thank Donald Trump [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1181.54s)]
*  for all these wonderful tariffs [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1183.1s)]
*  that he brought here and [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1184.72s)]
*  then remained. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1185.8s)]
*  They're not going to remain. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1186.88s)]
*  So the very, very, very long is [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1188.1200000000001s)]
*  still last is right after the tax [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1189.76s)]
*  cuts, then you'll never hear of [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1191.76s)]
*  them again. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1193.6000000000001s)]
*  I did a deal with Iceland and [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1194.6000000000001s)]
*  the place with the penguins. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1196.1200000000001s)]
*  And I'm such a great negotiator. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1198.28s)]
*  We don't need him anymore. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1200.0800000000002s)]
*  And then you'll never hear. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1201.1200000000001s)]
*  But how many months is that going [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1202.1200000000001s)]
*  to take and by then there's going [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1203.72s)]
*  to be a lot of damage in the real [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1205.6000000000001s)]
*  economy, not just the stock market. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1207.32s)]
*  So that's a great question, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1209.8s)]
*  because you're right, [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1211.28s)]
*  there was phase two is about [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1212.44s)]
*  the hit where the prices are [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1213.9s)]
*  actually going to go up. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1215.14s)]
*  Then there's going to be massive [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1216.18s)]
*  panic, right? [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1217.6200000000001s)]
*  So then that's the real question. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1218.46s)]
*  Can they sneak in the tax cuts [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1220.94s)]
*  before they take away the tariffs? [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1223.22s)]
*  because remember they're saying, [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1226.6200000000001s)]
*  $5.5 trillion in tax cuts. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1228.18s)]
*  Don't worry about it, [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheSnyLvhC8&t=1229.8600000000001s)]
