"Joe Rogan is worried that legal migrants could be wrapped up in the Trump administration‚Äôs deportation spree.

On a March 29 episode of the Joe Rogan Experience, the host praised President Donald Trump‚Äôs crackdown on illegal immigration but expressed horror at the news that the administration had deported a gay Venezuelan asylum-seeker along with suspected members of the Tren de Aragua gang."*

TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.

# WATCH: Joe Rogan Calls Trump's Deportations "HORRIFIC"
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [March 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw)
*  You gotta get scared that people [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=0.0s)]
*  who are not criminals are getting [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=2.7600000000000002s)]
*  lassoed up and deported and [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=5.64s)]
*  sent to El Salvador prisons. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=8.06s)]
*  With a bunch of these Tren Daragwa [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=10.88s)]
*  guys, allegedly they got one guy, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=13.52s)]
*  at least one guy who wasn't [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=16.14s)]
*  a criminal, who was just a gay [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=18.12s)]
*  barber who I think according to [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  the story came here legally. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=22.68s)]
*  He was here legally, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=24.8s)]
*  that's what they said. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=25.84s)]
*  Joe Rogan and [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=27.68s)]
*  Constantine Kissin weighed in on [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=28.6s)]
*  the wrongful deportation of [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=30.84s)]
*  a Venezuelan migrant who was sent [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=32.8s)]
*  to a maximum security prison in [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=35.08s)]
*  El Salvador with ICE claiming that [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=37.18s)]
*  he was a member of Tren Daragwa. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=39.68s)]
*  However, it appears that is not [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=42.16s)]
*  the case. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=44.32s)]
*  In fact, he wasn't even in [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=46.28s)]
*  the United States illegally, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=47.6s)]
*  he was here legally. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=49.24s)]
*  He had a legitimate asylum claim, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=51.040000000000006s)]
*  he came in through a port of entry [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  and made that asylum claim. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=55.92s)]
*  And his name's Andri Hernandez, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=58.6s)]
*  he's a gay makeup artist who's been [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=61.120000000000005s)]
*  an outspoken critic of Venezuela. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=63.68s)]
*  And I just feel like it's pretty [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=66.28s)]
*  obvious he's not a trended [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=68.48s)]
*  Aragwa gang member. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=70.46000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they don't even allow gay [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=72.12s)]
*  people into the gang. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=73.72s)]
*  So among a thousand reasons why [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=75.16s)]
*  he's not a gang member. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=77.08s)]
*  So this is what happens when you [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=79.12s)]
*  don't do due process. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=80.52000000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=81.68s)]
*  Because the courts are supposed to [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=82.2s)]
*  check, is he a gang member or [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=83.64s)]
*  isn't he? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=85.12s)]
*  Is he undocumented or isn't he? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=85.80000000000001s)]
*  Did he come here legally or not? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=87.56s)]
*  because if you don't check, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=89.64s)]
*  you get people who did come here [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=91.08s)]
*  legally and that aren't in a gang. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=92.52000000000001s)]
*  And that's why if he did this [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=94.64s)]
*  without doing it in a dumb way, and [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=96.76s)]
*  he just rounded up the actual gang [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=99.28s)]
*  and made sure they shipped him off. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=101.68s)]
*  Some people would still be mad that [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=104.32000000000001s)]
*  he's sending him to a hellhole in [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=105.92s)]
*  El Salvador. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=107.32000000000001s)]
*  But overall, the American people [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=108.2s)]
*  would be massively on his side. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=109.56s)]
*  Yeah, and look, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=110.72s)]
*  I want to be 100% clear. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=111.80000000000001s)]
*  Everyone, including individuals who [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=114.52s)]
*  are suspected of being gang [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=117.11999999999999s)]
*  members and there's actual evidence [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  showing that they're part, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=121.52s)]
*  doesn't matter. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=123.36s)]
*  You need to go through [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=124.39999999999999s)]
*  the proper channels. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=125.6s)]
*  There needs to be due process. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=126.75999999999999s)]
*  There's a reason why due process [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=128.92s)]
*  exists and if you think it's okay [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=130.64s)]
*  to just throw it away when it comes [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=132.56s)]
*  to individuals who the federal [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=134.64s)]
*  government is simply accusing [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=136.72s)]
*  unilaterally of doing something [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=138.72s)]
*  criminal. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=140.96s)]
*  Well, I mean, you're really [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=142.92s)]
*  allowing so much power to be [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=144.64s)]
*  concentrated in the federal [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=146.16s)]
*  government to the point where they [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=147.64s)]
*  can accuse anyone of anything and [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=149.35999999999999s)]
*  you don't get your day in court. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=151.04s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=152.95999999999998s)]
*  That is absolutely insane. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=153.79999999999998s)]
*  And I'm really happy that people [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=155.51999999999998s)]
*  are waking up to how insane that [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=156.88s)]
*  really is. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=158.07999999999998s)]
*  Now in this case, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=158.72s)]
*  we're talking about a Venezuelan [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=159.76s)]
*  migrant who made a legitimate [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=161.72s)]
*  asylum claim through the proper [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=163.48s)]
*  channels. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=165.51999999999998s)]
*  He was in the country legally. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=166.2s)]
*  He's sent to El Salvador, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=169.07999999999998s)]
*  meaning a third country to [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=170.88s)]
*  a detention facility for hardened [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=172.92000000000002s)]
*  criminals and terrorists, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=175.76s)]
*  that's CCOT. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=178.0s)]
*  That's insane. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=179.72s)]
*  Now, again, he had sought asylum [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=181.24s)]
*  in the United States through [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=182.8s)]
*  a port of entry. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=184.12s)]
*  But the Trump administration argues [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=185.04s)]
*  that he's part of Trende Aragua [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=186.64000000000001s)]
*  because he has gang tattoos. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=187.96s)]
*  Interesting, so [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=189.48000000000002s)]
*  they make the claim. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=190.28s)]
*  I want to see the gang tattoos. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=191.96s)]
*  Maybe they have a legitimate [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=193.2s)]
*  argument here. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=194.48000000000002s)]
*  Here's what the tattoos look like. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=195.76s)]
*  Here are the tattoos that [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=198.04s)]
*  he declared were evidence that [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=199.44s)]
*  this guy, gay makeup artist who [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=201.36s)]
*  came to a port of entry seeking [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=203.36s)]
*  asylum from Venezuela, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=205.28s)]
*  was a member of a vicious gang. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=206.88s)]
*  I'm not making this up. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=209.0s)]
*  This is it, mom and [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=210.0s)]
*  dad with crowns over them. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=211.72s)]
*  Those are not gang tattoos. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=214.48000000000002s)]
*  But apparently it didn't matter [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=217.44s)]
*  because despite the fact that it's [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=219.16s)]
*  obvious those aren't gang tattoos, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=220.84s)]
*  his lawyers have not been able to [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=222.72s)]

*  And after interviewing him, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=226.16s)]
*  he says he is not a member of [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=228.64000000000001s)]
*  the gang. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=230.92000000000002s)]
*  Somehow an ICE officer concludes [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=232.36s)]
*  that despite all that, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=234.72s)]
*  his two crown tattoos and mom and [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=236.32s)]

*  consistent with those of a Trende [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=240.32s)]
*  Aragua member. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=242.64000000000001s)]
*  No, they're not. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=245.48000000000002s)]
*  No, they're not. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=246.24s)]
*  They're just lying. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=246.84s)]
*  So with that context in mind, and [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=248.68s)]
*  knowing that this is what Rogan and [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=250.4s)]
*  Kissin are talking about, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=252.16s)]
*  let's hear more of what they [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=253.4s)]
*  had to say. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=254.56s)]
*  I think a human being being [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=255.36s)]
*  plucked out of nowhere and [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=257.64s)]
*  ending up in a country he's never [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=259.4s)]
*  been in, in a maximum security [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=261.2s)]
*  prison with gang members, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=262.79999999999995s)]
*  seems like a bad thing to happen [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=264.11999999999995s)]
*  to me. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=265.44s)]
*  It's horrific. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=265.96s)]
*  It's horrific. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=266.96s)]
*  I don't think that should be [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=267.67999999999995s)]
*  controversial. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=268.52s)]
*  No, that's not controversial at [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=269.08s)]
*  all. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=270.67999999999995s)]
*  And this is the thing, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=271.28s)]
*  measured twice, cut once. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=272.55999999999995s)]
*  This is kind of crazy that that [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=273.96s)]
*  could be possible. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=276.59999999999997s)]
*  That's horrific. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=279.11999999999995s)]
*  And again, that's bad for [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=279.84s)]
*  the cause. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=281.35999999999996s)]
*  The cause is let's get the gang [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=282.03999999999996s)]
*  members out. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=283.47999999999996s)]
*  Everybody agrees. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=284.03999999999996s)]
*  But what's not innocent gay [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=284.67999999999995s)]
*  hairdressers get lumped up with [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=286.2s)]
*  the gangs? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=287.76s)]
*  And then how long before that guy [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=288.36s)]
*  can get out? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=290.59999999999997s)]
*  Can we figure out how to get them [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=291.4s)]
*  out? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=292.76s)]
*  Is there any plan in place to [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=293.88s)]
*  alert the authorities that they've [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=295.59999999999997s)]
*  made a horrible mistake and [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=296.84s)]
*  correct it? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=297.96s)]
*  Well, if you think about it from [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=299.08s)]
*  a government perspective, and [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=300.15999999999997s)]
*  this is where I think it gets [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=301.24s)]
*  quite sinister, is once you've [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=302.15999999999997s)]
*  done that, the incentive structure [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=303.88s)]
*  is never going to be to admit that [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=306.12s)]
*  and deal with it. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=307.96s)]
*  The incentive structure is to say [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=308.76s)]
*  nothing, to cover it up, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=310.12s)]
*  to pretend it didn't happen. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=311.24s)]
*  But that is horrible. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=312.91999999999996s)]
*  So someone ends up in a black hole. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=314.08s)]
*  But we've seen it. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=315.48s)]
*  We've seen it in every country, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=316.36s)]
*  including in America. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=318.08s)]
*  But that's the thing about [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=319.56s)]
*  politics, right? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=320.48s)]
*  Never admit your fault. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=321.24s)]
*  Never admit your wrong. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=322.36s)]
*  This is so dumb. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=323.48s)]
*  And this is the thing we're seeing [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=324.2s)]
*  with the signal thing. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=325.24s)]
*  And this is the thing we're seeing [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=326.32s)]
*  with this. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=327.24s)]
*  And there seems to be more [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=328.92s)]
*  frustration with the lack of [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=330.6s)]
*  accountability or the willingness [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=332.6s)]
*  to take responsibility for [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=334.84s)]
*  mistakes made. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=336.32s)]
*  So far, we haven't heard anything [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=337.4s)]
*  from the Trump administration in [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=339.08s)]
*  regard to this specific individual [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=340.64s)]
*  who was sent away. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=342.64s)]
*  But you should know that we have so [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=343.92s)]
*  far spent about $40 million to send [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=346.56s)]
*  migrants to El Salvador's CICOT. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=349.6s)]
*  And that's according to [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=352.71999999999997s)]
*  the State Department. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=353.92s)]
*  They apparently did an analysis and [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=354.88s)]
*  provided that analysis to senators. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=356.76s)]
*  There was a delegation of five [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=359.2s)]
*  senators who even visited. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=360.96s)]
*  I'm sorry, that's for Gitmo. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=363.0s)]
*  So we've spent $40 million to jail [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=364.36s)]
*  400 migrants at Guantanamo Bay. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=366.84s)]
*  So it's not just El Salvador. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=369.68s)]
*  We're also sending them to [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=371.24s)]
*  Guantanamo Bay, but [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=372.92s)]
*  that has become so expensive that [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=374.08s)]
*  the Trump administration quietly [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=375.92s)]
*  stopped doing that. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=377.84000000000003s)]
*  And they actually sent about half [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=379.2s)]
*  of those 400 migrants back to [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=380.96s)]
*  the United States because of how [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=382.56s)]
*  costly it was. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=384.36s)]
*  But I should also note that we've [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=386.2s)]
*  been paying El Salvador as well. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=387.8s)]
*  The last time it was reported, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=389.64s)]
*  we spent about $6 million to send [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=391.32s)]
*  migrants there. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=393.16s)]
*  And now a federal judge has stepped [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=394.6s)]
*  in to do an emergency order to [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=396.88s)]
*  temporarily block what the Trump [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=398.88s)]
*  administration is doing. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=401.2s)]
*  So this federal judge has issued [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=402.92s)]
*  the ruling saying that, listen, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=404.72s)]
*  you can't do this without due [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=406.64s)]
*  process, okay? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=408.32s)]
*  So we're going to do [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=409.6s)]
*  a temporary block. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=410.76s)]
*  This is federal judge, US district [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=411.68s)]
*  judge Brian Murphy. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=413.88s)]
*  He's based in Boston and he stated [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=415.68s)]
*  that the Trump administration must [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=417.4s)]
*  give those, they want to deport [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=419.16s)]
*  a meaningful opportunity to seek [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=420.8s)]
*  humanitarian protection in the US. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=422.44s)]
*  And Murphy wrote that officials may [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=425.52s)]
*  not deport someone to a so-called [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=427.72s)]
*  third country unless and until they [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=429.96000000000004s)]
*  provide the deportee and [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=432.04s)]
*  their lawyer written notice of [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=433.56s)]
*  the country to which they are being [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=435.44s)]
*  sent. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=437.48s)]
*  Then the judge said officials must [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=438.24s)]
*  let them apply in immigration court [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=440.56s)]
*  for protection to stay in the US [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=442.84000000000003s)]
*  under the Convention Against [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=444.96000000000004s)]
*  Torture, which Congress [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=447.02000000000004s)]
*  ratified back in 1994. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=448.72s)]
*  And then after that, the judge said [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=450.52000000000004s)]
*  the agency must await a final [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=452.64s)]
*  decision from an immigration judge. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=454.44s)]
*  That's when the due process comes [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=456.92s)]
*  in. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=458.20000000000005s)]
*  So two really positive developments [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=459.18s)]
*  there because what are we most [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=460.94s)]
*  worried about in the Trump years? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=462.3s)]
*  That they're going to be lawless, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=464.18s)]
*  right? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=465.46s)]
*  So if Trump serves four years, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=465.96s)]
*  creates a giant mess, but [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=467.7s)]
*  at the end of the day, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=469.3s)]
*  we get back to America. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=470.46s)]
*  There's elections and Democrats can [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=471.86s)]
*  win, Republicans can win, and [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=474.14s)]
*  etc. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=475.98s)]
*  Then it's all good, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=476.98s)]
*  it's all good, right? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=477.86s)]
*  So the four years will be terrible, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=478.94s)]
*  but that's the consequence of [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=480.86s)]
*  elections, so we got to work harder [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=482.46s)]
*  to win, etc., right? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=484.26s)]
*  So one, the courts hold up today, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=485.82s)]
*  that's what just happened, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=488.74s)]
*  what Ana just read you, right? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=490.1s)]
*  So they say, no, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=491.5s)]
*  you can't go without due process, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=492.62s)]
*  you got to check with us first. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=494.62s)]
*  Let's hope that Trump [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=496.14s)]
*  administration listens to the [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=497.34s)]
*  courts, so great, courts are [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=499.02s)]
*  holding so far. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=500.74s)]
*  Then number two, I always like to [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=501.5s)]
*  believe that the entire [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=503.22s)]
*  brosphere, Joe Rogan, etc., [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=504.5s)]
*  were all Trump cultists and [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=506.1s)]
*  would never disagree with him, and [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=507.78s)]
*  would never hold him accountable. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=509.82s)]
*  Hm, that looks like they were [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=511.9s)]
*  holding him accountable, okay? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=513.62s)]
*  And that's not just Rogan, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=516.1s)]
*  it's Austin Kissin. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=517.6999999999999s)]
*  So he's a guy who's on the right, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=518.3399999999999s)]
*  I went on a show, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=520.14s)]
*  we had a big debate, funny enough, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=520.98s)]
*  about transgender girls in high [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=522.78s)]
*  school sports. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=524.38s)]
*  I said they should be in high [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=525.9399999999999s)]
*  school sports, he said they [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=526.9399999999999s)]
*  shouldn't, and we had a big debate [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=527.8199999999999s)]
*  about that. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=529.3s)]
*  But he's a free speech advocate, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=529.9s)]
*  and I was like, well, let's see. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=531.42s)]
*  When Trump gets into office, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=533.3s)]
*  we'll see if you're a real free [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=534.38s)]
*  speech advocate. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=535.74s)]
*  And look at that, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=536.86s)]
*  turns out, here he is. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=537.9s)]
*  This is not about free speech as [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=539.86s)]
*  much as more about don't send [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=541.42s)]
*  an innocent man to a jail in [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=542.9399999999999s)]
*  a foreign country, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=544.38s)]
*  where they're going to torture him. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=545.98s)]
*  It's about the fundamental right [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=548.58s)]
*  of due process. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=549.98s)]
*  Yes, but human rights, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=550.94s)]
*  human rights. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=552.3s)]
*  So he stands up for him, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=553.1s)]
*  great job, Constantine, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=554.46s)]
*  nice job, we appreciate it. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=555.78s)]
*  Rogan stands up for it, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=557.34s)]
*  calls it horrific, says it [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=558.34s)]
*  shouldn't even be controversial, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=559.58s)]
*  it's clearly wrong. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=561.18s)]
*  Now, it is controversial, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=562.54s)]
*  there are MAGA guys who are totally [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=563.74s)]
*  like, whatever, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=565.46s)]
*  they're not citizens, who cares? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=566.18s)]
*  We don't know, maybe he came in [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=568.1s)]
*  here illegally, I trust Trump, okay? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=570.06s)]
*  That also exists, right? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=572.5s)]
*  But here is independent media [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=574.18s)]
*  outlets and the personalities [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=576.46s)]
*  going, no, not on our watch, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=578.9399999999999s)]
*  this is wrong. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=581.42s)]
*  Now, I said that online and [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=583.22s)]
*  some people responded, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=584.86s)]
*  not good enough, he has to [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=586.34s)]
*  apologize to all non-Trump. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=587.8199999999999s)]
*  Okay, whatever, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=589.86s)]
*  who cares about that? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=590.54s)]
*  But look, let's get back to [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=591.42s)]
*  the actual political analysis here [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=592.74s)]
*  because the one area where Trump [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=594.62s)]
*  is still doing well, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=596.18s)]
*  the one area where he's not polling [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=597.22s)]
*  underwater is immigration. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=599.02s)]
*  But if more and more stories like [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=601.02s)]
*  this come out, if more and more of [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=602.62s)]
*  his supporters start speaking out [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=604.46s)]
*  against what his administration is [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=606.4200000000001s)]
*  doing with immigration, it will not [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=608.62s)]
*  bode well for Trump or [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=610.86s)]
*  the Republicans. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=612.1s)]
*  And just to give you the latest [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=613.38s)]
*  numbers according to the latest [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=615.1s)]
*  CBS YouGov poll on the topic of [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=617.0600000000001s)]
*  immigration, about 53% of Americans [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=618.86s)]
*  approve of what the Trump [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=621.1s)]
*  administration is doing and [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=622.46s)]
*  47% disapprove. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=623.9000000000001s)]
*  He's underwater in every other [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=624.7800000000001s)]
*  area, including the economy. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=626.22s)]
*  And so that's something for [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=627.9000000000001s)]
*  him to keep in mind. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=629.46s)]
*  He thinks he's killing it with [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=630.94s)]
*  immigration, but [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=632.66s)]
*  if you make these massive mistakes [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=633.78s)]
*  and innocent people like this [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=635.9s)]
*  makeup artist, this gay makeup [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=637.78s)]
*  artist who spoke out against [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=639.66s)]
*  Venezuela and had a legitimate [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=641.38s)]
*  claim, asylum claim gets shipped [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=643.3s)]
*  off to a detention facility for [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=645.34s)]
*  hardened criminals, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=647.14s)]
*  gang members and terrorists, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=648.46s)]
*  people are going to start turning [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=650.3s)]
*  on you. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=651.9s)]
*  Okay, last two things. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=652.42s)]
*  Look, I would hope that even if [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=653.74s)]
*  you're on the right, that you would [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=655.82s)]
*  say, hey, it's one thing the [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=658.34s)]
*  send off guilty people to that [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=660.32s)]
*  hellhole in El Salvador. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=662.1600000000001s)]
*  It's another thing to send off [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=664.1600000000001s)]
*  an innocent guy there. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=665.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=666.2800000000001s)]
*  Please tell me you think that. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=667.2s)]
*  Okay, I think all decent people [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=668.84s)]
*  should agree to that. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=670.48s)]
*  I'm thrilled to see Rogan and [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=671.7600000000001s)]
*  Kissin agree on that as well. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=673.32s)]
*  And then finally, to Anna's point [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=675.24s)]
*  in what we're all saying here, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=677.6400000000001s)]
*  which is, look guys, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=679.8000000000001s)]
*  there's still significant issues [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=681.24s)]
*  about why not just send them back [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=683.5200000000001s)]
*  to their home country? [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=685.6s)]
*  Why pay a foreign government, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=687.12s)]
*  some of our members wrote in about [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=688.88s)]
*  that too, a foreign government to [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=690.76s)]
*  basically torture them there? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=692.6800000000001s)]
*  So those are all legitimate [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=694.5600000000001s)]
*  questions. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=696.44s)]
*  But if you're on the right, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=697.84s)]
*  Anna's totally right. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=699.24s)]
*  This is going to make your position [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=700.6s)]
*  totally unpopular. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=702.1600000000001s)]
*  In fact, I think Rogan said it too. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=703.08s)]
*  So why are you being [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=705.0400000000001s)]
*  counterproductive? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=706.0400000000001s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=707.0400000000001s)]
*  Now on the left, they said there [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=708.6s)]
*  was no trend to Aragua. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=710.1600000000001s)]
*  The rest of them are trend [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=713.5600000000001s)]
*  to Aragua. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHdUY0PiLw&t=714.5600000000001s)]
