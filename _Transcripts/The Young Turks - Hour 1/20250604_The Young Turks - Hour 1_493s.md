"Fox News host Lawrence Jones was left visibly frustrated after he was unable to fold a fitted sheet during a Friday morning segment, saying, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think men should do this."
"The moment came as the Fox & Friends co-hosts took the show outside to engage in ‚ÄúAdulting 101‚Äù skills that are currently befuddling helpless Gen Zers unable to complete basic life skills like sewing, changing a tire, and cooking."

TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.
The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.
On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.
Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.
Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.
TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.
TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.

# Fox News Host Gets Owned By A Fitted Sheet
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM)
*  my god, I don't think men should do [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=0.0s)]
*  this, my hands are too big for [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=3.04s)]
*  this. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=6.08s)]
*  I don't think men should do this, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=10.58s)]
*  my hands are too big for this, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  the this being folding a folded or [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=15.58s)]
*  fitted sheet. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=18.18s)]
*  And so this reminded me of how men [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=19.52s)]
*  can never find anything in the [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=22.02s)]
*  house, they'll open the fridge, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=24.28s)]
*  the ketchup's right in front of [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=26.66s)]
*  their face. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=28.8s)]
*  But they engage in this weaponized [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=30.080000000000002s)]
*  incompetence because they want [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=31.68s)]
*  the women to do everything for [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=33.22s)]
*  them, so they'll be like, babe, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=34.56s)]
*  babe, where's the ketchup? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=36.160000000000004s)]
*  It's right in front of you, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=37.16s)]
*  it's right in front of you. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=38.8s)]
*  Anyway, I just wanted to vent about [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=41.08s)]
*  that for a second, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=42.64s)]
*  not really a story, it's more- [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, apparently. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=44.68s)]
*  Frustration. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=45.88s)]
*  Yeah, I just like that you threw [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=46.6s)]
*  that in there, I'm like, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=48.68s)]
*  wait, where's this going? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=50.24s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=52.08s)]
*  Well, because Cenk, I do get [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=52.92s)]
*  irritated when I get asked where [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=54.92s)]
*  things are around the house. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=57.28s)]
*  And I think- [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=59.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=60.120000000000005s)]
*  I finally stopped to ask myself [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=60.68s)]
*  why, why do I get triggered by [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=62.480000000000004s)]
*  that? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=64.2s)]
*  And I think it's because, by the [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=64.76s)]
*  way, I love my husband, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=66.6s)]
*  he's a wonderful husband, and [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=67.88s)]
*  I know that this isn't unique to [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=69.54s)]
*  him. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=71.24000000000001s)]
*  But I think that culturally, even [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=71.74000000000001s)]
*  now, even with women going out [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=73.84s)]
*  there into the workforce, earning [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=75.6s)]
*  money, in some cases even being [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=77.64s)]
*  the breadwinner in the household, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=79.44s)]
*  they're still expected to do a lot [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=81.44s)]
*  of the cleaning and a lot of the [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=83.36s)]
*  cleaning and [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=85.04s)]
*  a lot of the traditional female [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=85.80000000000001s)]
*  coded stuff around the house on top [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=87.96000000000001s)]
*  of their jobs, on top of their [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=90.2s)]
*  career. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=92.12s)]
*  And so we know where everything is [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=92.88000000000001s)]
*  because we do everything, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=95.04s)]
*  you get what I'm saying? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=96.60000000000001s)]
*  And it frustrates me especially [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=98.0s)]
*  when I get asked to do something [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=100.80000000000001s)]
*  that's super easy to do because [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=103.28s)]
*  it's literally right in front of [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=105.60000000000001s)]
*  you, you get what I'm saying? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=108.12s)]
*  It's just very common and [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=110.72s)]
*  I see it happen in pretty much [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=112.4s)]
*  every relationship in every [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=114.39999999999999s)]
*  household. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=116.24s)]
*  Yeah, so I'm going to defend guys [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=117.63999999999999s)]
*  here a little bit and I'm going to [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=119.75999999999999s)]
*  disagree with you on the ketchup and [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=121.96s)]
*  brace for impact on your wrath. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=124.38s)]
*  But first off, my hands are too [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=126.63999999999999s)]
*  big for this? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=129.72s)]
*  I know. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=131.24s)]
*  Come on, brother, you got to come [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=132.76s)]
*  up with a better excuse than that. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=134.79999999999998s)]
*  Okay, I can't read all of this, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=137.04s)]
*  my eyes are too big for it. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=139.51999999999998s)]
*  What is this? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=142.12s)]
*  It's like the lamest excuse I've [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=144.4s)]
*  ever, I don't know how to fold, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=146.64s)]
*  hands too big. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=148.96s)]
*  Is this some sort of weirdo [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=151.28s)]
*  genital reference or something? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=152.24s)]
*  What's with the hands being too [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=153.56s)]
*  big? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=155.2s)]
*  Okay, anyways, so okay, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=155.76s)]
*  on the other hand- [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=157.48s)]
*  No, Cenk, weaponized incompetence, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=158.52s)]
*  that's what that was. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=160.68s)]
*  Because if you just say, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=161.96s)]
*  I don't know how to do this, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=163.24s)]
*  I need the woman to do this, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=164.72s)]
*  the woman will come in and do it [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=166.2s)]
*  because it needs to be done. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=167.88s)]
*  It needs to be done. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=169.36s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, so I love your phrase [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=170.56s)]
*  weaponized incompetence and [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=172.48s)]
*  that does exist. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=174.2s)]
*  But my defensive meant is that it's [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=175.4s)]
*  not purely meant, okay? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=177.16s)]
*  Because my grandmother used to have [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=178.72s)]
*  weaponized incompetence. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=180.28s)]
*  It's kind of a funny thing, right? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=181.52s)]
*  Because like grandmas, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=183.44s)]
*  you expect to be like, take care. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=184.8s)]
*  You're like, my mom's a grandma now, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=186.84s)]
*  she's like the prototypical grandma [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=189.04s)]
*  who's taking care of things and [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=191.04s)]
*  etc. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=192.64000000000001s)]
*  But not my grandma, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=193.2s)]
*  she was, let's be honest, I loved [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=194.32s)]
*  her but she was a little bit lazy, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=196.16s)]
*  okay? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=198.12s)]
*  So she would go- [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=198.92000000000002s)]
*  I love your grandma so much. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=200.28s)]
*  I love her so much. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=201.84s)]
*  Okay, continue. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=203.52s)]
*  So we'd be setting the table and [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=204.48s)]
*  I'm six or seven at the time or [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=206.6s)]
*  whatever, right? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=208.72s)]
*  And she's like, I can't reach, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=210.08s)]
*  the glasses are too high. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=213.16s)]
*  Like, yeah, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=216.04s)]
*  that's because you're not reaching. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=216.56s)]
*  You didn't even lift your arm. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=219.12s)]
*  If you reach, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=221.32s)]
*  you would actually raise it. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=222.04s)]
*  So now as a seven year old, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=223.6s)]
*  I got to figure out how to climb on [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=224.72s)]
*  the kitchen cabin to get the [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=226.04s)]
*  glasses because grandma's too lazy [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=227.2s)]
*  to do it. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=228.72s)]
*  What a hero. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=231.08s)]
*  Okay, you know what? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=231.88s)]
*  You just did relationship therapy [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=234.28s)]
*  for me because you're right. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=236.08s)]
*  I didn't stop to think about how [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=237.88s)]
*  the other side weaponizes [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=239.56s)]
*  incompetence. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=241.0s)]
*  So my weaponized incompetence has [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=241.88s)]
*  to do with my car, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=243.96s)]
*  anything car related. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=245.08s)]
*  No, the change oil light is on. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=246.88s)]
*  What do I do? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=250.68s)]
*  See, see, caught you. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=252.0s)]
*  Caught you. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=256.48s)]
*  Spend time at Jiffy Lube, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=257.04s)]
*  you do it. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=258.64s)]
*  Okay, no, but okay, now back to [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=260.12s)]
*  the catch up though, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=261.96s)]
*  I'm going to lose you again. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=263.24s)]
*  Okay, because look, when you ask [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=264.71999999999997s)]
*  for the Jiffy Lube or [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=267.15999999999997s)]
*  I asked for the ketchup, there. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=268.56s)]
*  Okay, there's a reason. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=271.08s)]
*  Okay, there's a reason. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=277.8s)]
*  And so look, if I'm at home and [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=279.91999999999996s)]
*  I asked my wife for something, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=282.03999999999996s)]
*  that means I think if I already [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=284.08s)]
*  know where it is, I'll go get it. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=285.96s)]
*  I know where the mayo is, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=288.32s)]
*  I know where the cheese is, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=289.55999999999995s)]
*  I know where all those things are. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=290.88s)]
*  Why am I going to waste my time, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=292.4s)]
*  let alone your time, to ask you for [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=294.32s)]
*  a thing I know where it is? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=296.35999999999996s)]
*  If I'm asking you, that means by [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=297.88s)]
*  definition, I don't know where it [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=299.88s)]
*  is and I think there's a chance [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=301.96s)]
*  that you do know, so instead of me [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=303.91999999999996s)]
*  looking around for 12 minutes, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=306.08s)]
*  you'll just tell me and [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=308.28s)]
*  we'll both save a lot of time. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=309.71999999999997s)]
*  No, we want you to look around for [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=311.64s)]
*  12 minutes, that's what we want. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=313.23999999999995s)]
*  That's, I caught you again. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=314.91999999999996s)]
*  Hold on, let me just say, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=315.96s)]
*  hold on, let me reframe that, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=317.36s)]
*  rephrase that because we don't want [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=319.20000000000005s)]
*  you to struggle for 12 minutes. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=321.48s)]
*  But I think the problem is that [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=323.48s)]
*  there's no effort to find it, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=325.96000000000004s)]
*  none at all, ever. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=328.40000000000003s)]
*  It's just, why am I going to bother [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=330.72s)]
*  even looking for this? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=332.72s)]
*  I'm going to inconvenience my wife [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=334.0s)]
*  to just hand it to me. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=336.24s)]
*  But Anna, are you a car expert? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=337.8s)]
*  You're not a car expert, are you? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=340.0s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=342.48s)]
*  Okay, no, you're not a car. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=343.56s)]
*  So that's why if Christian's better [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=344.56s)]
*  with the cars, then he should, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=346.52s)]
*  yeah, it's okay to ask him to take [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=348.28s)]
*  care of the car, right? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=350.08s)]
*  And if- [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=351.32s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=351.88s)]
*  he knows how to rev my engines. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=352.68s)]
*  Wow, there you go, okay. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=354.12s)]
*  Well. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=356.56s)]
*  And if you know where the ketchup [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=357.56s)]
*  is and he doesn't, get him to damn [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=360.56s)]
*  ketchup or tell him where the [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=363.64s)]
*  ketchup is. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=366.44s)]
*  Listen, yes, look, fine. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=367.35999999999996s)]
*  We just want to see a little bit [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=370.56s)]
*  of effort. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=371.79999999999995s)]
*  But to be fair, I don't really put [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=372.52s)]
*  any effort in my, I literally do [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=374.15999999999997s)]
*  everything from my car to my car. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=375.76000000000005s)]
*  It'll be like just, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=378.36s)]
*  it's always super clean inside [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=379.44000000000005s)]
*  because I care about cleanliness [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=381.04s)]
*  a lot, but the outside of it, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=382.72s)]
*  who cares? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=384.16s)]
*  It's just filth. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=384.76000000000005s)]
*  And sometimes it'll get so bad [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=386.20000000000005s)]
*  that Christian's like, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxonoaNnLM&t=387.8s)]
