"The car bombing outside a California fertility clinic that killed one person and injured four others appears to have been driven by anti-natalist ideology, according to two senior law enforcement officials briefed on the incident.

The suspect, identified by authorities as Guy Edward Bartkus, is believed to have detonated the explosive in Saturday‚Äôs attack, which claimed his own life."

# 'Anti-Natalist' Allegedly Bombs Fertility Clinic, Leaves Manifesto
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [May 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc)
*  fertility clinic in Palm Springs bombed this weekend, what the FBI is calling an act of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=0.0s)]
*  terrorism. Suspect 25 year old Guy Edward Barkus died in the explosion, injured four others as well [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=5.84s)]
*  caused significant damage to the American reproductive centers facility. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=14.48s)]
*  Authorities say Barkus expels extreme ideologies that argue against procreation and view life as [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=21.04s)]
*  inherently harmful. Left behind a 30 minute audio manifesto attempted to live stream the attack. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=29.6s)]
*  The FBI is on the case but has already released their theory on a motive. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=35.92s)]
*  Akil Davis, head of the FBI's Los Angeles office said they were treating the incident [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=40.0s)]
*  as an intentional act of terrorism. Davis added that online posts and other evidence suggested [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=45.2s)]
*  the suspect had nihilistic ideations and that this was a targeted attack against an IVF facility. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=51.68000000000001s)]
*  FBI spokesperson Laura I. Miller meantime also said the agency was investigating whether the [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=59.76s)]
*  suspects alleged anti natalist views were a motive behind the attack. The blast which [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=64.64s)]
*  occurred just before 11 AM on May 17 shattered windows of nearby buildings. It was felt more [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=72.32000000000001s)]
*  than a mile away. That's how powerful it was. And despite the destruction, no embryos or staff [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=78.24000000000001s)]
*  members were harmed in this as the clinic was closed at the time. So Jane, this attack marks a [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=84.96s)]
*  disturbing escalation. We're seeing this ideological violence. I guess what does that tell us [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=92.63999999999999s)]
*  about the current state of extremism inside the US? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=99.44s)]
*  Yeah, I'm actually really worried about it. And I'll tell you why. So this guy is a [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=103.75999999999999s)]
*  super rando, like he's an anti natalist. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=110.39999999999999s)]
*  Whatever, like what is that? So it's people who think there should be less people on earth [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=115.44s)]
*  and less children. That's like your opinion, man. And there's a good way to deal with that. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=121.67999999999999s)]
*  Don't have kids. What are you trying to blow up other people for? So I had to look up to see if [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=128.4s)]
*  that's a left wing or right wing position. I don't know what wing it is. I don't know, maybe left. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=134.48000000000002s)]
*  I don't know. But that's my point, which is now everybody who's mentally disturbed [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=140.96s)]
*  writes a manifesto and decides that their issue is the most important thing. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=148.96s)]
*  And either usually gets an assault rifle and goes and kills a whole bunch of people, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=153.6s)]
*  or these days they're blowing up cars in front of places. It's so frustrating. And then so how [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=159.92s)]
*  do those ideas A, get into their head? And then B, how does the second idea get in their head, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=166.07999999999998s)]
*  which is, okay, if you're anti natalist or pro natalist or whatever, you have to somehow murder [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=171.92s)]
*  people. But far, far too often Sharon, that step two happens now that it didn't happen before. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=177.04s)]
*  I'm really upset about this or I'm really animated by this. And that's step one that happens all the [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=188.07999999999998s)]
*  time. Step two, I will now murder people because of it. That's the part that's deeply disturbing. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=194.32s)]
*  What's the next attack going to be? Because of natalism? No. Because of something that makes [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=200.39999999999998s)]
*  sense? No, of course not. Most of these people have mental health issues. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=205.36s)]
*  So what's the next one going to be about? I don't know. But I do know there will be one [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=209.12s)]
*  and they will get that second thought in their head. Right, since I believe adamantly in something [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=214.4s)]
*  that means by definition I should go murder people for it. No, it doesn't. No, it doesn't. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=219.52s)]
*  You could be super animated about things. You see me on air, I'm super animated about things. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=224.16000000000003s)]
*  That doesn't mean I have to kill anyone. So apparently I have to tell people this, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=229.44000000000003s)]
*  stop killing people. It's scary. Because- [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=234.16s)]
*  That is. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=239.04s)]
*  Sharon, one more thing about that. Because people listen to shows, people listen to [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=239.84s)]
*  different things and not just in politics, but in things that arouse passion. And I don't think [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=245.68s)]
*  that it's the host's fault, I don't think it's the show's fault, etc. But now there's an idea [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=253.2s)]
*  out there that if someone is making you mad, the correct answer isn't to debate them. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=258.96s)]
*  The correct answer isn't to get involved in fixing the problem, doing something productive. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=266.08s)]
*  The correct answer is tear them down, either like their character, their reputation, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=272.47999999999996s)]
*  who they are, or just murder them, right? And so I think that's a disastrous idea and I'm [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=279.12s)]
*  worried that it's spreading like a virus. Yeah. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=284.24s)]
*  Got to figure out what this, it's not just a call to action, it's converting to this call to deadly [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=286.96000000000004s)]
*  action. And where is that coming from? Where it leaves passion and moves into that realm. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=293.44s)]
*  The perpetrators, the accused father Richard broke down in tears during a televised interview [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=300.64s)]
*  here. He expressed shock, sorrow by learning of his son's actions. He admitted he hadn't seen [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=306.88s)]
*  his son in more than a decade, but he did recall him as a good kid, liked hiking. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=312.56s)]
*  He liked to go hunting, he liked to go rock hunting. He liked his computer, he had a good heart, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=317.84s)]
*  something changed in him. But what was that? Investigators are examining Barkus's online [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=325.04s)]
*  activities, including a website, social media postings that detailed his extremist beliefs [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=330.56s)]
*  and hinted at plans for the attack. FBI is treating this as one of the largest bombing [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=335.6s)]
*  investigations in Southern California history. California Governor Gavin Newsom, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=341.12s)]
*  Attorney General Pam Bondi have both condemned the attack, pledging full support for the ongoing [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=344.72s)]
*  investigation. Is there any part of you that if not blame, believes that the intelligence community, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=350.56s)]
*  I mean, if he had certain postings, he was leaning towards an attack of this kind. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=358.32s)]
*  Should authorities have known about it? No, that's why it's so scary. No, how the [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=362.32s)]
*  hell are they supposed to know about this rando who's anti-natalist and gonna do a bombing? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=367.92s)]
*  Unless he said it and they're tracking meticulously all of online comments, etc. Maybe, maybe, maybe. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=373.68s)]
*  But no, I think people are too quick to blame folks for it. So sometimes this happens, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=381.84000000000003s)]
*  and that's why it's even scarier, because stopping the next one is incredibly difficult. If I had a [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=387.76s)]
*  great answer for how to stop the next one, I'd be very happy to share it, but I don't have one. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=393.44s)]
*  And so for the dad, by the way, just so you know, he did also say that this guy was always in the [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=398.08s)]
*  bombs, but he said little bombs like smoke bombs, think bombs and stuff like that, nothing dangerous. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=404.88s)]
*  Yeah, I hear you, I hear you, but didn't end well. And he hadn't seen his son in 10 years, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=410.24s)]
*  so he really didn't know what was going on. But again, I'm not blaming the dad, I'm not blaming [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=416.88s)]
*  anybody. I'm just saying everybody put out, the only thing I can think of to do that's positive is [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=421.92s)]
*  everybody put out the message that physical violence is never the answer. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=429.28000000000003s)]
*  That's basically saying I can't defend my ideas intellectually. I surrender, I'm no good at this, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=433.44s)]
*  I'm mentally weak, hence I will resort to violence instead. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=440.32s)]
*  As you were saying that it reminded me of the insurance CEO killing. Now there are a lot of [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=444.0s)]
*  people who said, look, we're getting left on our death beds, we're not being helped. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=449.76s)]
*  So maybe it's justified, maybe they didn't go that far, some did though. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=456.56s)]
*  It's just, it's mind boggling how we get a handle on some of this. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=461.84000000000003s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below, an angel gets a swings. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=466.24s)]
*  Totally not true, but it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvSJ3XAy1Kc&t=469.44s)]
