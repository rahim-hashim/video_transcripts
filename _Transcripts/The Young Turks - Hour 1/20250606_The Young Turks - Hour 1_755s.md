"The most powerful alliance in US politics crumbled in real-time on Thursday, with President Donald Trump and Elon Musk lobbing political barbs and personal insults at each other from their respective social media platforms.
The pair‚Äôs biggest media allies at Fox News ‚Äî the most-watched cable news network on the planet, often viewed as a clearinghouse for the MAGA agenda ‚Äî seem to be having a little difficulty with the breakup.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.
Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.
Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.
TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful.

# Right-Wingers Are In MAJOR DISTRESS Over Trump, Musk War
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU)
*  We first and foremost have to point out the hypocrisy and how the right wing in this country [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=0.0s)]
*  is so anti LGBTQ and so gay at the same time. I'm saying like they just get to talking about guys [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=5.68s)]
*  and it's just like this is what men do. They have big balls and they sweat and they rub it all over [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=12.48s)]
*  each other and they trade blows cuz their balls are so big. Dude, this is not good because this [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=17.12s)]
*  is got everything written on it for a civil war. And you know what's the one thing about both of [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=23.439999999999998s)]
*  them? They're both not gonna, they're not gonna compromise. I don't like it. I want it to stop. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=30.56s)]
*  I want to tell them if they're both watching, knock it off. I don't want to see my parents [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=38.4s)]
*  fighting. Sometimes guys fight. Guys sometimes will punch you in the face and the next night [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=42.96s)]
*  you're having a beer. Sleep with your girlfriend and you patch things up. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=48.16s)]
*  That okay. Well, I don't know about all that man. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=51.68s)]
*  Yeah, it sounds like a personal problem. Right wingers are in various stages of grief [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=55.04s)]
*  following Elon Musk and Donald Trump's explosive showdown yesterday. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=61.36s)]
*  They've fractured in many different subgroups, but it seems like most are despondent over the [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=65.36s)]
*  falling out and worried that their two daddies are splitting up for good. Matt Gaetz, for example, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=70.72s)]
*  responded fully with yay on this after Kanye West tweeted bros, please know we love you both so much. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=76.56s)]
*  Laura Ingraham poured cold water on Charlie Kirk's hopes that the men could reconcile. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=84.8s)]
*  Take a look. I will say it's a tough thing to watch this public feud. I actually think they're [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=90.16s)]
*  going to reconcile at some point though, because deep down I would like to believe they both want [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=96.08s)]
*  the same thing. President Donald Trump built this movement for 10 years. His supporters are not [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=100.64s)]
*  going anywhere. I hope that Elon and now reconcile would be good for the country and to do so privately. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=105.84s)]
*  Well, I talked to an insider today who said it's irreparable. That was the line. It is irreparable. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=113.36s)]
*  Right, maybe. Others have landed squarely on Donald Trump's side like Laura Loomer, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=121.84s)]
*  who issued this demand to Elon Musk last night on X. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=127.04s)]
*  Elon Musk, please tweet something nice about President Trump tonight. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=130.88s)]
*  Steve Bannon is going even further calling for Elon Musk to be deported. Take a look. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=136.24s)]
*  And President Trump should be taking immediately, I think. When he threatens to [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=142.0s)]
*  take one of the big programs out of SpaceX, President Trump tonight should sign an executive [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=145.28s)]
*  order calling for the Defense to Production Act to be called in SpaceX and seize SpaceX tonight [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=152.16s)]
*  before midnight. The US government should seize it. I don't know why we haven't had a [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=159.92s)]
*  full investigation. Look, if you're going to deport illegal aliens, you got to deport [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=164.16s)]
*  illegal aliens. The good go with the goose in the gander. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=168.88s)]
*  They got to go back to this as Stuart Stevens talked about and go through everything about his [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=174.16s)]
*  immigration status. I happen to believe, given the facts that I've been shown, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=178.95999999999998s)]
*  that he's an illegal alien. An illegal alien has got to be deported. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=183.51999999999998s)]
*  Also, this drug use is reported in the New York Times, the drug use in the New York Times. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=187.35999999999999s)]
*  If that's a fact, that ought to be investigated. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=191.04s)]
*  He also told Politico, you're gonna tell me we should allow some blanking punk [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=192.88s)]
*  to sit there and say he should be impeached and JD Vance should step in. Blank you, dude. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=198.88s)]
*  We're going to blanking war and I'm going to rip your blanking face off. So [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=204.79999999999998s)]
*  seems to be a little worked up. But he's made his allegiances clear. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=209.83999999999997s)]
*  But yet another faction of right wingers are taking a different tact and dismissing [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=213.68s)]
*  the seriousness of the fight altogether. Jack Posovic, his take was especially hilarious. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=218.0s)]
*  Some of y'all can't handle too high agency males going at it and it really shows. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=224.8s)]
*  This is direct communication, parentheses, phallocentric versus indirect communication, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=230.8s)]
*  gynocentric. I understand you aren't used to it. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=238.0s)]
*  Joey Manarino similarly said, Trump and Elon aren't attacking one another in a way that won't [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=242.24s)]
*  be fixed. People forget how men with testicles spar. You're watching two people with balls the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=248.32s)]
*  size of the moon debate an issue. This is what masculinity looks like. Some lunatics are claiming [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=254.88s)]
*  the whole fight is calculated and a scheme that Trump and Musk are both in on to make Democrats [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=261.92s)]
*  demand that the Epstein files be released. Cenk, do you think people are making too big [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=267.92s)]
*  of deal out of this falling out or how big are their testicles here? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=273.68s)]
*  Okay, God, we're going to have a lot of fun with this. All right, let's start with the funny stuff [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=279.20000000000005s)]
*  first, okay? So what was that about? You sleep with somebody's girlfriend, you'll be having a [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=284.24s)]
*  beer the next, I don't know about that part. No, no, that's not a lot of guys I know, okay? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=290.24s)]
*  I don't know what's going on at Fox News, but I kind of do. Secondly, the testicle fight. I mean, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=297.04s)]
*  I didn't think you could beat phallocentric. And then the guy comes in and he's like, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=303.92s)]
*  they got big testicles and they're fighting with their testicles. And that is the height [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=308.8s)]
*  of masculinity, is it? Is that really the height of masculinity? And then, but I will give credit to [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=312.40000000000003s)]
*  Jack Pasobiac, who's maybe got the only name harder to pronounce than mine, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=320.08s)]
*  for the phallocentric line. Well, that's true. This does revolve around two pricks fighting [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=326.48s)]
*  each other. So it is phallocentric, right? Okay, and I've been looking forward to using the word [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=332.56s)]
*  gynocentric my whole life. And finally, I can use it. What is that? What is it? They complain about [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=339.52s)]
*  the woke left makes up terms, right? What is gynocentric means indirect communication? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=346.32s)]
*  What is that? It's just totally made up and hilarious. None of that is true. It's just two [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=354.48s)]
*  guys with giant egos fighting one another. Now, the unfortunate part, guys, one more on the funny [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=362.32s)]
*  this is a good transition from funny to disastrous. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=371.03999999999996s)]
*  Matt Gates, what do you, I mean, look, maybe we're not surprised, but what are you doing? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=374.79999999999995s)]
*  Of all the people in this conflict to agree with, you wound up agreeing with Ye? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=381.03999999999996s)]
*  Was there someone else that said that you could have agreed with? You shouldn't fully or even [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=388.4s)]
*  partially agree with Ye on anything, okay? And I don't even want to call him a Kanye, okay? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=393.2s)]
*  Whatever the hell he think and everybody's gotta stop changing their name like 24 seven. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=398.0s)]
*  All right, finally to the serious stuff. Steve Bannon is a super dangerous dude, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=402.8s)]
*  right? So what is that? We should deport him. Elon's a US citizen. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=408.64s)]
*  Yeah, he's a naturalized citizen. So what? I'm a naturalized citizen. What does that mean? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=416.16s)]
*  We're supposed to have the same exact rights. So I don't like you. And so you weren't born here, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=421.6s)]
*  so I'm going to deport you is not a thing. That's just wildly illegal and unconstitutional. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=428.72s)]
*  And then at the end of that statement, we didn't have it there, but I saw the long version. He's [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=434.8s)]
*  like, that's why we gotta be, this is a constitutional Republican way of defending. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=439.6s)]
*  You're you just said something against the US Constitution. They just use words like [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=444.56s)]
*  Constitution, America, flag, democracy as if they know what it means, as if they're in favor of it. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=451.12s)]
*  Well, they're not really in favor of it at all, right? No, we're not going to randomly [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=457.12s)]
*  deport citizens because they hurt Donald Trump's feelings. And then then seizing SpaceX. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=461.03999999999996s)]
*  Steve Bannon's a communist now, we're going to nationalize a giant private corporation. Look, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=467.52s)]
*  you know me, I mean, nobody fights harder against corporate power and corporate rule than I do. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=474.96s)]
*  But even I wouldn't randomly see someone's company, and I certainly wouldn't do it because [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=480.08s)]
*  they hurt the president's fee fees. So no, that's crazy talk. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=485.44s)]
*  Well, I think that we first and foremost have to point out the hypocrisy and how [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=491.12s)]
*  the right wing in this country is so anti LGBTQ and so gay at the same time. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=496.08000000000004s)]
*  I'm saying like they just get to talking about guys and it's just like, this is what men do. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=502.48s)]
*  They have big balls and they sweat and they rub it all over each other and they trade blows [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=506.48s)]
*  because their balls are so big. And then in addition to yay, being just a straight up Nazi, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=511.04s)]
*  making songs like Hitler was awesome, bro. He put out a song recently that's talking about [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=518.88s)]
*  how him and his cousin used to give each other fellatio and stuff. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=524.4s)]
*  He could have kept that to himself, but he figured that he would let the whole world know. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=528.4s)]
*  And there's no commentary about that whatsoever from the right wing. It's like, no, Kanye's still [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=533.6s)]
*  that dude because he kowtows behind Trump and anything that has to do with the Republican brand, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=538.64s)]
*  which is a very important thing to bring up because you know how they're always acting like [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=544.88s)]
*  we don't care what celebrities think. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=549.28s)]
*  No, you just have all the lame celebrities because anytime any celebrity is on board with [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=551.44s)]
*  their agenda, they'll look past anything. But at the end of the day, the question about [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=557.12s)]
*  how the right is responding to this. I think at the end of the day, they know what's up like [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=563.44s)]
*  what we've been talking about. These men have the biggest egos in the world. They're two of [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=568.88s)]
*  the most powerful people alive and they're not going to back down. They're not going to quit. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=572.96s)]
*  They've been wounded and it's definitely irreparable, but this could definitely cause [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=578.72s)]
*  a lot of damage. They may continue to fight, but I'm here for it. I'm all for it. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=584.24s)]
*  Well, the part that stuck out for me the most that I thought was the funniest was [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=589.12s)]
*  Laura Loomer, just the hanger on demanding that Elon Musk tweet something nice about Trump's [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=593.52s)]
*  rushing in like a wartime medic. No, please, we need to respond to Donald Trump's feelings now. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=600.88s)]
*  Please tweet something nice about him tonight. That's obviously ridiculous. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=608.08s)]
*  She also claimed that she had been on the hill talking to staffers and representatives all day. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=613.92s)]
*  Notorious liar, but also really troubling signs if she's given and getting access on the hill. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=620.72s)]
*  The funniest thing, yes, I think is the kind of weirdly homoerotic descriptions of them fighting. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=628.0s)]
*  And it's just like two old, like allegedly one hopped up on ketamine guys, just kind of slap [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=634.0s)]
*  fighting on their respective social media networks. And the right having to try to turn everything [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=640.64s)]
*  into some 300 type epic being like, yes, two intellectual gladiators. And it's just like the [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=645.68s)]
*  most pithy sub tweeting like, I'd really be ashamed if I took away your government contracts. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=653.68s)]
*  And then wow, this is epic. This is masculinity at its best. But maybe on the on the Matt Gaetz stuff [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=658.64s)]
*  with the Kanye song, he just heard a 14 year old was involved and that's why he liked it. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=665.12s)]
*  Damn, okay. There is one other thing that's really important here. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=669.8399999999999s)]
*  One of our members on YouTube wrote in Jonathan Ernst, I love doing the show with you guys, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=676.3199999999999s)]
*  it's a way to participate. He said we're so close to the end of the two party system. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=680.8000000000001s)]
*  That's another iceberg that's not being discussed here because at the end, Elon Musk said, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=686.24s)]
*  maybe we should form a third party. And he did a poll and his own followers said 80-20 yes. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=692.88s)]
*  Now, that is a lot of ramifications. But one of the ramifications is if he splits the right wing vote, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=699.84s)]
*  that would be massive. So is he really if he just keeps going and it goes from just theatrics and [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=706.64s)]
*  ball slapping to forming a third party with a massive amount of money and that takes votes away, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=718.4s)]
*  presumably a hell of a lot more from the Republicans. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=725.92s)]
*  That could be really good. Super interesting. On the other hand, I don't want the Democrats to be [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=730.4s)]
*  even more lazy and complacent. So but look, the two party system has not been great to America [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=735.12s)]
*  for a long, long time. So if it heads in that direction, it might have a lot of surprising [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=741.52s)]
*  upsides. Every time you ring the bell below, an angel gets his wings. Totally not true, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=747.1999999999999s)]
*  but it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkjj_37fcLU&t=752.16s)]
