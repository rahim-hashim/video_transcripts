"Walmart heiress Christy Walton, one of the richest women in America, has joined a small group of billionaires speaking out against President Donald Trump.
The 76-year-old Walton, who is worth an estimated $19.3 billion according to Forbes, paid to take out a full-page advertisement in The New York Times on Sunday calling on readers to ‚Äúmobilize‚Äù on Saturday, June 14. The advertisement appears to be an escalation of one she paid for in March, also in The Times print edition."*

# Why Is MAGA Boycotting Walmart?
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4)
*  heiress to the Walmart fortune at [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=0.0s)]
*  about 19 points a mod billion is [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=2.32s)]
*  saying that we the American people [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=4.62s)]
*  reject kings. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=7.0200000000000005s)]
*  And I say, okay, good for you. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=8.08s)]
*  I reject Walmart. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  First of all, y'all suck. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=13.52s)]
*  Y'all are evil. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=15.4s)]
*  I don't like you in [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=16.44s)]
*  the first place. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=17.28s)]
*  I almost never go to Walmart. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  I try to avoid it whenever possible. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=19.56s)]
*  That wasn't some socialist leftist [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=23.6s)]
*  that was Tim Pool talking about how [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=26.0s)]
*  he hates Walmart. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=28.32s)]
*  Didn't see that coming until I [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=30.48s)]
*  realized MAGA is in fact considering [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=32.64s)]
*  a boycott against Walmart, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=35.24s)]
*  which will be a lot more complicated [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=37.12s)]
*  and difficult to carry out compared [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=39.620000000000005s)]
*  to the Bud Light boycott. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  But nonetheless, before we get to [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=44.08s)]
*  MAGA, here's what we know so far. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=46.6s)]
*  And the question that we should all [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  be asking ourselves, why exactly is [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  a multi billionaire who's worth [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=53.92s)]
*  a fortune, absolute fortune, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=56.08s)]
*  because she's a Walmart heiress, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=58.16s)]
*  shelling out big bucks to support [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=60.559999999999995s)]
*  protests against Donald Trump? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=62.72s)]
*  We really should be asking that [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=66.52s)]
*  question. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=67.92s)]
*  So Christy Walton is her name and [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=68.44s)]
*  she is a Walmart heiress. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=70.92s)]
*  She was married to one of the men [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=72.92s)]
*  in the Walton family. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=75.92s)]
*  So that's how she inherited her [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=79.0s)]
*  wealth after her husband passed [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=81.24s)]
*  away from a tragic plane accident. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=83.52s)]
*  But she's worth nearly $20 billion, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=86.32s)]
*  billion with a B. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=89.08s)]
*  And she just paid for [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=90.8s)]
*  a full page ad in the New York [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=92.19999999999999s)]
*  Times promoting the no kings day [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=94.16s)]
*  protests against Donald Trump, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=96.52s)]
*  which will be taking place [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=98.88s)]
*  this Saturday. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=100.55999999999999s)]
*  So you're looking at the full page [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=101.83999999999999s)]
*  ad as we speak, it features an [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=103.83999999999999s)]
*  image of the Statue of Liberty with [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=105.72s)]
*  a series of declarations like, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=107.88s)]
*  we honor our commitments and [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=109.96s)]
*  stand by our allies. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=111.8s)]
*  We defend against aggression by [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=113.19999999999999s)]
*  dictators and we respect our [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=115.44000000000001s)]
*  neighbors and trading partners. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=117.56s)]
*  Okay, fascinating. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=120.12s)]
*  I mean, if I'd want to get into [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=121.80000000000001s)]
*  the granular details, but so far [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=124.04s)]
*  those declarations seem all right. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=126.52000000000001s)]
*  But what's going on? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=129.28s)]
*  Why is this billionaire so [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=130.52s)]
*  vociferous against the Trump [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=132.02s)]
*  administration? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=133.72s)]
*  And she doesn't ever really [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=134.72s)]
*  specifically name Trump in her [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=136.52s)]
*  attacks, but she does bankroll [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=138.52s)]
*  protests efforts against him, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=140.6s)]
*  ads against him. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=142.8s)]
*  And it's pretty fascinating. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=144.44s)]
*  So the Saturday no kings day [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=146.35999999999999s)]
*  demonstrations happen to coincide [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=148.35999999999999s)]
*  with Donald Trump's birthday, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=150.76s)]
*  which will yes also feature [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=152.95999999999998s)]
*  a military parade in the National [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=154.72s)]
*  Mall. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=156.92s)]
*  The Trump administration claims [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=158.12s)]
*  they want to do this to commemorate [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=159.64s)]
*  the army's 250th anniversary, but [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=161.35999999999999s)]
*  I'm old enough to remember Trump [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=163.32s)]
*  wanting a military parade for [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=165.04s)]
*  himself in his first term. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=166.76s)]
*  So I don't believe for [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=168.32s)]
*  a second that he's like, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=169.6s)]
*  I'm so concerned about the army. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=171.0s)]
*  I'm not going to do an anniversary [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=172.84s)]
*  celebration by having a military [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=174.44s)]
*  parade, but whatever, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=176.08s)]
*  I'm not going to get into that [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=177.32s)]
*  because what's more important is [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=178.84s)]
*  the people behind funding this [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=180.52s)]
*  protest, right? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=182.12s)]
*  And I don't have a problem with [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=182.96s)]
*  protesting Trump. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=184.76s)]
*  I don't have a problem with you [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=185.8s)]
*  being part of these no kings day [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=187.68s)]
*  events. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=189.64000000000001s)]
*  Apparently, there are going to be [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=190.2s)]
*  thousands of them all across [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=192.24s)]
*  the country. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=194.04s)]
*  The protests are being organized by [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=194.84s)]
*  a small group of billionaires. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=196.8s)]
*  And that's what I'm actually [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=198.68s)]
*  concerned about. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=200.12s)]
*  Not because I just inherently [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=201.2s)]
*  despise billionaires and [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=202.76s)]
*  think they're all evil. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=204.16s)]
*  I know some people do. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=205.35999999999999s)]
*  For me, it's what are you doing in [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=207.12s)]
*  society? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=209.51999999999998s)]
*  Well, what kind of contribution do [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=210.72s)]
*  you have to society? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=212.51999999999998s)]
*  And I'll judge you based on that. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=213.51999999999998s)]
*  Organizers of the counter protest [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=215.28s)]
*  told Axios they are expecting this [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=217.28s)]
*  to be the largest single day rally [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=219.48s)]
*  since the start of [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=221.56s)]
*  the administration. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=222.64s)]
*  No Kings spokesperson Andrew Cook [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=224.0s)]
*  told Forbes there will be more than [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=226.39999999999998s)]
*  1800 events across the country. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=228.68s)]
*  So though they say that they're [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=231.84s)]
*  organizing this event, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=233.88s)]
*  they're staying away from DC in [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=235.4s)]
*  particular probably because they [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=237.68s)]
*  don't want to be blamed for [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=239.96s)]
*  any potential riots that might take [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=241.68s)]
*  place in DC as this like Trump [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=244.12s)]
*  birthday slash military parade is [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=246.2s)]
*  happening. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=248.64000000000001s)]
*  They say that instead of allowing [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=249.48000000000002s)]
*  this birthday parade to be the [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=251.44s)]
*  center of gravity, we will make [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=253.28s)]
*  action everywhere else. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=255.16s)]
*  The story of America that day, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=256.88s)]
*  people coming together in [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=258.76s)]
*  communities across the country to [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=260.52s)]
*  reject strongman politics and [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=262.68s)]
*  corruption, the collective states [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=264.68s)]
*  on its website. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=266.96s)]
*  So look, so far so good. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=268.0s)]
*  They're protesting Trump, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=270.08s)]
*  they want to support those who [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=271.4s)]
*  want to protest Trump, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=272.76s)]
*  they're organizing this. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=273.76s)]
*  But I want to focus a little bit on [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=275.56s)]
*  Christie Walton, because Christie [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=277.44s)]
*  Walton is not our friend. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=279.56s)]
*  I just want you guys to be aware of [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=282.35999999999996s)]
*  that and I don't want you to make [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=283.96s)]
*  the mistake that I think the [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=285.64s)]
*  Democratic Party overall has made [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=287.12s)]
*  that thinking enemies of Trumps, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=289.04s)]
*  regardless of who they are, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=291.4s)]
*  have to be our friends. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=293.52s)]
*  No, sometimes there are enemies of [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=296.04s)]
*  Trumps that are not our friends. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=298.12s)]
*  And based on Christie Walton's [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=300.48s)]
*  campaign donation history, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=302.88s)]
*  not our friend, not our friend. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=305.28s)]
*  So she has co-hosted a fundraiser [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=308.28s)]
*  for Kamala Harris and Jackson Hole. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=310.28s)]
*  So she really didn't want Trump to [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=312.6s)]
*  win, she hates Trump. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=314.28s)]
*  The question is why, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=315.8s)]
*  why does she hate Trump? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=316.76s)]
*  We'll get to that. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=318.08s)]
*  She contributed $100,000 to [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=319.32s)]
*  the Welcome Pack, which is a [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=321.24s)]
*  political action committee that [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=322.96s)]
*  helps Democrats. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=324.8s)]
*  She also gave the Lincoln Project, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=325.76s)]
*  which is run by never Trump [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=327.84s)]
*  Republicans from the Bush era, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=329.28s)]
*  $200,000 in donations. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=331.2s)]
*  In fact, her donations lately are [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=333.15999999999997s)]
*  very different from what you'll see [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=336.0s)]
*  from her history. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=338.91999999999996s)]
*  In fact, she donated almost [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=341.08s)]
*  exclusively to Republicans in [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=342.84s)]
*  the 90s. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=344.84s)]
*  And throughout the Bush [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=345.68s)]
*  administration seems like a bit of [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=346.92s)]
*  a never Trump Republican, right? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=348.71999999999997s)]
*  Her political donations did switch [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=351.32s)]
*  a little bit to Democrats in [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=353.71999999999997s)]
*  the summer of 2008, likely because [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=355.68s)]
*  Obama appeared poised to win [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=358.15999999999997s)]
*  the presidential election and [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=360.3s)]
*  Congress was going to be taken over [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=362.3s)]
*  by Democrats. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=364.52s)]
*  So she was probably hedging her [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=365.56s)]
*  bets, that's what donors do. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=367.4s)]
*  They want to have influence over [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=369.44s)]
*  both parties. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=371.32s)]
*  And look, what's really interesting [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=372.44s)]
*  to me is that she was still giving [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=374.84s)]
*  campaign donations to Union Busters, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=377.32s)]
*  like Scott Walker, okay? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=379.91999999999996s)]
*  In fact, she gave him a massive [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=381.91999999999996s)]
*  contribution of $50,000 on May 10th [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=384.71999999999997s)]
*  of 2022 alone. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=388.23999999999995s)]
*  She also gave the Libertarian [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=391.47999999999996s)]
*  National Committee $33,400 in [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=394.15999999999997s)]
*  August of 2016. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=397.58s)]
*  Now, this is going to shed some [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=399.64s)]
*  light on my theory here because [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=401.91999999999996s)]
*  there are two camps in [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=405.04s)]
*  the libertarian movement. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=406.6s)]
*  There's the, we love corporations, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=408.76s)]
*  we're so pro-business that we want [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=412.0s)]
*  undocumented immigrants to come in [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=414.76s)]
*  because we want these corporations [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=417.36s)]
*  to have access to cheap labor that [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=419.68s)]
*  they can exploit, individuals who [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=421.88s)]
*  will have no recourse. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=424.24s)]
*  So they like the type of open [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=425.88s)]
*  borders type policy, right? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=427.56s)]
*  And then there's the camp that [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=429.32s)]
*  people like Dave Smith fall under. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=431.08s)]
*  He's not such a libertarian, but [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=433.16s)]
*  he is not in favor of bringing in [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=435.28000000000003s)]
*  undocumented immigrants so [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=437.36s)]
*  corporations can exploit them to [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=439.24s)]
*  the detriment of American workers, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=441.24s)]
*  right? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=443.36s)]
*  So that's the argument that I've [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=443.86s)]
*  heard him make. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=445.24s)]
*  So I don't want to say that all [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=445.84000000000003s)]
*  libertarians have the same view on [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=447.20000000000005s)]
*  immigration, but there is a long [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=448.8s)]
*  history of libertarians wanting to [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=450.52000000000004s)]
*  have undocumented immigrants [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=452.32000000000005s)]
*  easily accessible to corporate [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=454.12s)]
*  interests. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=455.96000000000004s)]
*  So why does she hate Trump so much, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=457.08000000000004s)]
*  especially given his affinity for [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=459.32000000000005s)]
*  tax cuts, deregulation, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=461.76000000000005s)]
*  the very things that would benefit [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=463.8s)]
*  Walmart? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=466.28000000000003s)]
*  Well, it's because there's a catch. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=467.8s)]
*  We know what the catch is, right? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=470.40000000000003s)]
*  And if you don't, it's okay, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=471.92s)]
*  because one of my favorite reporters [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=473.32000000000005s)]
*  James Lee gives us some insight. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=475.08000000000004s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=476.84000000000003s)]
*  What do you think her end game here [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=478.72s)]
*  is? Is she really worried about [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=480.36s)]
*  authoritarianism or [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=482.04s)]
*  human rights abuses? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=483.32000000000005s)]
*  Or is she just after cheap labor? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=484.64000000000004s)]
*  Okay, over 70% of SNAP recipients [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=487.0s)]
*  and Medicaid users were full time [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=488.92s)]
*  workers and many of them are from [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=490.68s)]

*  The irony is certainly not lost on [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=493.8s)]
*  me that the biggest organized [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=495.76s)]

*  accident that the bottom 50% of [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=503.36s)]

*  we get all our cheap goods from? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=516.08s)]

*  distract us from everything other [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=523.08s)]
*  than paying people a living wage. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=525.0s)]
*  Aside from that, Walmart has gotten [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=527.0s)]
*  into a bit of a spat with President [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=529.52s)]
*  Donald Trump over his tariffs [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=531.6800000000001s)]
*  policy. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=533.64s)]
*  In fact, the executives over at [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=534.2s)]
*  Walmart have gotten into a public [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=536.08s)]
*  fight with him over that. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=538.12s)]
*  And so it's worth knowing that 40% [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=540.9200000000001s)]
*  of the products, I'm sure it's more [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=543.2s)]
*  than that, but 40% of the products [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=545.5600000000001s)]
*  that they sell is imported and [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=547.9599999999999s)]
*  they do love cheap labor. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=549.8s)]
*  And if you're thinking, well, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=551.4799999999999s)]
*  she inherited her husband's wealth. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=553.24s)]
*  I mean, is she like some sort of [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=555.64s)]
*  executive or something over? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=556.9599999999999s)]
*  Well, no, she owns a part of [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=558.1999999999999s)]
*  the company, okay? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=560.36s)]
*  She owns, I think it's like 1.9% if [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=562.3199999999999s)]
*  I'm not mistaken, that's a lot. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=565.0799999999999s)]
*  And so the profit maximization of [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=568.16s)]
*  Walmart is obviously something that [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=570.7199999999999s)]
*  she knows is going to benefit her. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=573.56s)]
*  And so if Walmart's business will [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=576.5999999999999s)]
*  be undercut through the lack of [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=578.68s)]
*  access to cheap labor, whether it's [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=580.76s)]
*  abroad or on our own soil due to [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=583.28s)]
*  undocumented immigrants, well, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=585.4s)]
*  then she's going to hate Trump. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=587.76s)]
*  Because he wants to do something [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=589.92s)]
*  about those two things, right? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=591.1999999999999s)]
*  He wants to implement these [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=592.2399999999999s)]
*  tariffs, he wants to stop [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=593.4s)]
*  undocumented immigration. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=594.56s)]
*  Those two things are going to hurt [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=596.56s)]
*  the bottom line for Walmart. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=598.4799999999999s)]
*  So finally, I'm going to pivot over [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=600.3199999999999s)]
*  to the MAGA boycotts because news [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=602.56s)]
*  about Christy Walton is paying for [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=605.0799999999999s)]
*  ads that promote anti-Trump [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=607.36s)]
*  protests has really upset MAGA, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=609.24s)]
*  okay? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=611.64s)]
*  They are very upset, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=612.16s)]
*  they're talking about it. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=613.4s)]
*  You heard Tim Pool a little earlier. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=615.0s)]
*  So they're calling for [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=617.04s)]
*  a Walmart boycott, which again, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=618.4s)]
*  I'm going to repeat, is not going [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=620.4399999999999s)]
*  to be as easy as a Bud Light [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=622.36s)]
*  boycott. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=623.8399999999999s)]
*  You're just boycotting one item, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=624.52s)]
*  one product. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=626.3199999999999s)]
*  There are parts of this country [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=627.28s)]
*  where literally all there is is [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=628.68s)]
*  a Walmart. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=630.04s)]
*  So I don't know if it's going to be [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=630.9599999999999s)]
*  as effective this time around, but [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=632.4399999999999s)]
*  I think it's cool raging out and [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=634.1999999999999s)]
*  honestly accidentally making [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=635.9599999999999s)]
*  a progressive argument against [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=637.56s)]
*  Walmart's practices. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=639.04s)]
*  I still don't like Walmart and [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=640.28s)]
*  I'll take the excuse to boycott [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=641.9599999999999s)]
*  them. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=643.68s)]
*  There were accusations that [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=644.24s)]
*  Walmart locations were telling [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=645.8s)]
*  people who work there to go on food [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=647.64s)]
*  benefits because they didn't get [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=649.4399999999999s)]
*  paid enough money. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=651.24s)]
*  They said if you can't afford to [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=652.3199999999999s)]
*  work here, consider going on [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=654.0799999999999s)]
*  benefits, which kind of weird [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=655.68s)]
*  because in order to qualify for [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=657.36s)]
*  benefits, you have to make below [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=659.16s)]
*  a certain amount of money. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=661.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=662.56s)]
*  Walmart uses our tax dollars to [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=663.64s)]
*  subsidize their employees. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=665.88s)]
*  At least that was the big [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=668.6800000000001s)]
*  accusation. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=669.96s)]
*  The argument being that if we did [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=671.0s)]
*  not offer that welfare benefit, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=672.72s)]
*  Walmart wouldn't be able to hire [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=674.44s)]
*  these people because they'd simply [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=676.12s)]
*  say you don't pay enough. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=678.0400000000001s)]
*  Well, as the story went, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=680.32s)]
*  Walmart told everybody, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=681.44s)]
*  sure we do. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=682.76s)]
*  You just got to get supplemental [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=683.84s)]
*  income for food from the government. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=685.4s)]
*  My biggest takeaway from this [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=689.12s)]
*  story is that we need to find a way [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=690.4s)]
*  to get corporate executives to [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=691.9200000000001s)]
*  attack Trump more. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=693.8000000000001s)]
*  That's it. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=695.32s)]
*  That's all we need to do. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=696.84s)]
*  And then we can sit back and wait [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=698.6s)]
*  for right wingers to do our [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=700.44s)]
*  messaging for us because that's [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=702.0s)]
*  what you just heard from Tim Pool. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=703.7600000000001s)]
*  That was amazing. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=705.2800000000001s)]
*  Congratulations, Tim Pool. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=706.6400000000001s)]
*  Welcome to 2025. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=708.0s)]
*  Yes, this has been an issue with [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=709.6s)]
*  Walmart for many, many years. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=711.48s)]
*  So if we want to boycott Walmart [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=714.12s)]
*  for that reason, I jump in it. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=715.88s)]
*  I hope it does work out because [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=717.96s)]
*  those labor practices absolutely [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=719.96s)]
*  disgust me and they should discuss [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=722.1999999999999s)]
*  to everyone across the board, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=724.1999999999999s)]
*  regardless of your political [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=725.9599999999999s)]
*  affiliation. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=727.48s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=728.3199999999999s)]
*  an angel gets his wings. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=729.88s)]
*  Totally not true, but it does keep [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IByllu76x4&t=731.4399999999999s)]
