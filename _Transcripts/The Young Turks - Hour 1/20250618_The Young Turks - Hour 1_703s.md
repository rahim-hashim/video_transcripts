On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.
Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.
Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

# U.N Official BLASTS Israel For War Crimes in Gaza
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q)
*  The goal of the Israeli government is abundantly clear, the destruction of life in Gaza. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=0.0s)]
*  For a year and a half now, our commission has been investigating the violence in Gaza. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=8.0s)]
*  We have seen constant escalation and more and more deaths and injuries. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=13.88s)]
*  In the last three months, the entire population of Gaza was forcibly transferred into small [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=19.32s)]
*  enclave and Palestinians were killed while attempting to receive aid, bringing life to [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=25.72s)]
*  its bleakest point to date. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=33.24s)]
*  Now, if you talk to an Israeli, they'll tell you, no, no, no, it's not the IDF. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=35.24s)]
*  It's Hamas that's shooting at desperate, hungry Palestinians as they're trying to get flour from [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=40.68s)]
*  these humanitarian aid hubs. But you just heard someone from the UN. So the situation in Gaza has [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=47.16s)]
*  never been worse, according to Navi Pillay, who is the chair of the Commission of Inquiry on the [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=54.28s)]
*  Occupied Palestinian Territory at the United Nations. So she's calling the war in Gaza the [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=62.92s)]
*  most ruthless, prolonged, and widespread attack against the Palestinian people since 1948. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=69.56s)]
*  And she laid out the findings of her commission report that were released to the Human Rights [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=76.68s)]
*  Council last month. Now, I'm gonna quickly pause for further context because [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=82.68s)]
*  if you notice, the Israeli government loves to trash the UN or any UN organization. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=88.12s)]
*  And it's because the UN is an international body that sometimes does investigations into [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=94.2s)]
*  Israel's conduct. And they don't like that. They don't like to be held accountable. They hate it. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=99.96000000000001s)]
*  Oh my God, you're calling us out on our war crimes? No, we're the civilized ones. We're not [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=105.16000000000001s)]
*  the barbarians. No, sometimes you guys act like barbarians. In fact, right now, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=110.2s)]
*  acting like barbarians. Just keep it real. You don't like the truth, too bad. We're gonna slap [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=114.76s)]
*  you with it. So she starts with how Israel's ongoing assault has impacted children. Let's [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=119.56s)]
*  take a look. Children have paid an unimaginable price. More than 1,300 children have been killed [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=124.60000000000001s)]
*  just from the end of the ceasefire on 18th March to date. And more than 15,000 children have been [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=134.28s)]
*  identified as having been killed since October 2023. Our findings show that as Israeli security [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=142.2s)]
*  forces killed thousands of children, they also obliterated the education system in Gaza. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=152.44s)]
*  More than 90% of schools and university buildings in Gaza have been damaged [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=159.72s)]
*  or destroyed, creating conditions where education for children has been made impossible. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=165.88s)]
*  There are videos of IDF soldiers going into hospitals and literally breaking [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=173.0s)]
*  any equipment that remains. Why would they do that? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=181.16s)]
*  Was Hamas hiding in the monitors of the gadgets that they need at that hospital? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=185.16s)]
*  Is that what happened? Come on. Don't insult the intelligence of people who have actually [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=190.2s)]
*  been paying attention to what's happening on the ground there. We all see it. And now you have a [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=196.83999999999997s)]
*  UN report to back it up. Notably, while Israeli forces often claim that they were targeting [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=202.28s)]
*  Hamas operatives, allegedly based in schools, the commission verified only one instance [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=207.56s)]
*  of Hamas using a school for military purposes. That is unsurprising to say the least, but they'll [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=213.64s)]
*  still perpetuate that lie. And that's the thing about how Israel is losing this PR war. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=220.51999999999998s)]
*  Because number one, I mean, it's difficult to defend the indefensible. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=227.64s)]
*  But number two, they're lazy. They've got three or four talking points and they just rotate those [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=231.79999999999998s)]
*  same talking points over and over again. Human shields, Hamas tunnels, using it as a command [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=238.28s)]
*  center, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=244.44s)]
*  You guys are acting like barbarians and you're carrying out a genocide. That's what's happening. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=247.24s)]
*  From their findings, they concluded that Israel's targeting of civilian infrastructure and [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=251.48s)]
*  educational facilities is intentional, not accidental. And that they are indeed committing [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=255.72s)]
*  a slew of war crimes. Take a look. Israeli airstrikes have targeted educational facilities [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=261.72s)]
*  believed to be safe refuge. Areas killing the displaced, including children and women, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=270.28000000000003s)]
*  and deliberately shelled, burned, and demolished schools and universities. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=277.96000000000004s)]
*  The commission could not identify any military necessity which justifies such actions. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=284.04s)]
*  And we conclude that these actions show an intent to destroy these facilities in order to curtail [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=291.32s)]
*  Palestinians' access to education in the long term. These attacks were part of a wide [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=299.0s)]
*  widespread and relentless assault against the Palestinian people in which Israeli forces [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=307.0s)]
*  have committed war crimes, including directing attacks against civilians and willful killing [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=314.52s)]
*  and the crime against humanity of extermination. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=321.96s)]
*  In fact, yesterday, Tuesday of this week was such a gruesome day at these humanitarian aid hubs that [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=325.32s)]
*  upward of 100 people were killed by IDF as they're waiting in line to get flour. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=334.44s)]
*  The story was by the way, awful enough when the reported death toll was in the dozens, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=340.44s)]
*  and then it got updated and it was over 100 in a single day. Absolutely sick. So witnesses said [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=345.55999999999995s)]
*  that Israeli forces carried out an airstrike on a nearby home before opening fire toward the crowd. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=353.0s)]
*  Before I read this, remember a doctor working in the emergency room witnessed seven little bodies [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=358.03999999999996s)]
*  show up in that hospital, dead bodies. They were all her children. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=367.64000000000004s)]
*  And then later she found out two more of her children died in a single Israeli airstrike. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=372.68s)]
*  She only has one remaining child left. Her husband had survived the airstrike, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=378.52000000000004s)]
*  was hospitalized, but then later died. I mean, just disgust. It disgusts me. That's really the [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=384.28000000000003s)]
*  only way I can express myself and not be overly offensive. It disgusts me. This is barbaric. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=395.32s)]
*  Witnesses said that the Israeli forces carried out an airstrike on a nearby home [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=403.88s)]
*  before opening fire toward the crowd. The Israel Defense Forces said that it was aware of reports [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=407.32s)]
*  of a number of injured individuals from IDF fire following the crowd's approach and that the incident [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=412.76s)]
*  was under review. That's another talking point that you'll hear. Oh, oopsie, we got caught doing [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=418.84s)]
*  what appears to be a war crime or is definitely a war crime. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=424.68s)]
*  And don't worry, we're gonna investigate it. You're never gonna hear from it again. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=427.32s)]
*  What happened to the IDF soldiers in Janine who were shooting out international [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=430.44s)]
*  ambassadors who were visiting? What happened to them? What happened to that internal review? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=435.32s)]
*  I mean, their internal reviews are so ridiculous and non-existent that it makes local police [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=442.04s)]
*  departments in this country blush. It's insane. In a statement, the IDF said nothing of value, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=449.64s)]
*  nothing of value. I haven't even read this yet, but I already know nothing of value. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=457.88s)]
*  But nonetheless, said that a gathering was identified next to an aid distribution truck [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=461.56s)]
*  that got stuck in the area in proximity to IDF troops. The IDF regrets any harm. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=467.4s)]
*  Yeah, their statements mean nothing to me, nothing, okay? They're terrorists. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=474.2s)]
*  These people are carrying out acts of terror. They are killing innocent people on purpose. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=481.0s)]
*  This is not an accident. This has been going on for far too long. They want to wipe the Palestinians [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=486.84s)]
*  off the face of the earth and whoever remains, get them out of Gaza. We want this land. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=493.88s)]
*  But why would Israel be surrounded by so many enemies? Why? Why wouldn't anyone like, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=499.24s)]
*  why would people have a problem with Israelis? I don't get it. They've been so kind to people [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=505.72s)]
*  in that region. This is far from the first incident. Israeli troops have repeatedly shot [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=510.52s)]
*  and killed civilians approaching those hubs since they opened last month. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=517.56s)]
*  Since they opened last month, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, 397 people have been killed [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=523.4s)]
*  seeking aid from the sites which are located in both southern and central Gaza. And before I hear [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=530.2s)]
*  the ridiculous talking point of like, well, the Palestinian Health Ministry, they're controlled by [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=536.04s)]
*  Hamas. Okay, you also have what remains of the few journalists on the ground in Gaza. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=541.8s)]
*  A lot of them actually report to drop site news. Yeah, the casualties at these hubs [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=549.08s)]
*  in the hundreds, it's not made up. It's not made up. One other thing I'll just note. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=556.2800000000001s)]
*  Look, I don't know if my speculation here is sound, but I'm gonna say it anyway. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=561.5600000000001s)]
*  At the start of this war, at the start of this genocide, there were 2.2 million Palestinians in [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=568.36s)]
*  the Gaza Strip. And if you pay close attention, you'll notice something with how Trump talks [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=574.6s)]
*  about Gaza and how Netanyahu talks about Gaza. They don't say 2.2 million or 2.1 million. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=579.88s)]
*  They say 1.7 million Palestinians. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=587.5600000000001s)]
*  Are they telling on themselves? Why have they landed at 1.7 million Palestinians? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=594.12s)]
*  At the start of this genocide, there was 2.2 million. We keep hearing that the [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=601.16s)]
*  Gaza Health Ministry is not to be trusted. They inflate their numbers. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=605.48s)]
*  I don't even know how they count the number of people dead at this point. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=609.56s)]
*  What kind of infrastructure do they have to even be able to do that given the fact that Gaza is [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=616.1999999999999s)]

*  Netanyahu certainly knows the real number. So who knows? But I'm not believing at all that the [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=632.76s)]
*  actual death toll is around 60,000 Palestinians. I think it's much higher. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=639.72s)]
*  So look, these war crimes, they've been called out by various people and institutions. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=645.0s)]
*  The UN did this report, and I'm glad they did this report, but will it change anything? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=652.52s)]
*  I don't think it will. And that's the worst part about all of this, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=658.28s)]

*  showing up at the hospital with gunshot wounds to the head. How do you accidentally shoot [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=670.12s)]

*  who's trying to push us into going to war with another country that doesn't have nuclear weapons, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92eT-fDhe_Q&t=686.68s)]
