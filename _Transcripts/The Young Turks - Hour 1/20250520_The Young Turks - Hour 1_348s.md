"At least 50 Venezuelan men sent by the Trump administration to a prison in El Salvador had entered the United States legally, according to a review by the Cato Institute.

The report, published by the libertarian thinktank on Monday, analyzed the available immigration data for only a portion of the men who were deported to El Salvador‚Äôs notorious Terrorism Confinement Center (Cecot), and focuses on the cases where records could be found."

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

# REPORT: Trump Admin Is Deporting People Who Came To U.S. LEGALLY
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [May 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI)
*  Before they ever set foot in the United States, Lizbeth Sanguino and her sons went through [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=0.0s)]
*  months of vetting, in-person interviews and background checks to be resettled as refugees [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  from Venezuela. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  So she was shocked when the family arrived at the Houston airport and immigration agents [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=15.48s)]
*  arrested her 24-year-old son, Widmer Aguelbis. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=19.88s)]
*  The reason? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=23.8s)]
*  A tattoo of a rose and a clock, which an agent wrote are associated with the Venezuelan gang [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=24.88s)]
*  Tren de Aragua. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  Well sadly it turns out that Wilmer isn't the only immigrant who came into the United [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=33.4s)]
*  States through a legal process, only to be sent to a terrorist detention facility in [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=38.16s)]
*  El Salvador by the Trump administration. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  In fact, according to a new analysis by Libertarian Think Tankado Institute, dozens, dozens of [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=47.64s)]
*  immigrants or migrants I should say that the Trump administration has sent to CICOT, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=53.4s)]
*  which is that detention facility, entered the US legally. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=58.519999999999996s)]
*  They weren't here illegally. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=64.44s)]
*  Now I know that there are some Trump supporters who think it's the same, they don't care, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=66.56s)]
*  you're here legally, illegally, whatever, Trump's supporting you, that's great. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=70.2s)]
*  But for those who actually care about human rights, who care about the rule of law, who [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=73.56s)]
*  care about due process, this story should concern you and concern you quite a bit. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=77.72s)]
*  So they write in their report that for 48% of the 174 deportees about whom they have [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=82.28s)]
*  some information, they have no info about their method of crossing into the United States. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=90.56s)]
*  But of the 90 cases where the method of crossing is known, 50 men report that they came legally [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=96.08s)]
*  to the United States with advanced permission at an official border crossing point. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=104.92s)]
*  Yeah, so guys, I used to be for the death penalty and you can think whatever you want [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=111.36s)]
*  about that. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=115.88s)]
*  And I believe in justice and sometimes a little bit of vengeance. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=116.88s)]
*  So I don't know if that makes me a bad person or not, but I stopped being for the death [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=123.11999999999999s)]
*  penalty, why? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=126.52s)]
*  The Innocence Project proved that 4% of the people on death row were innocent. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=128.16s)]
*  It was actually dozens of people that we were going to kill when they didn't do it. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=132.72s)]
*  So it's one thing to kill somebody when they killed someone, it's another one to kill [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=137.2s)]
*  an innocent person, right? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=141.79999999999998s)]
*  So in this case, if you say, hey, we gotta close the border, we're gonna kick out people [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=143.6s)]
*  who are undocumented. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=147.32s)]
*  I understand that's what the American people did vote for. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=148.32s)]
*  And to this day, it pulls it a little above 50%, so I get it. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=151.39999999999998s)]
*  But it's a different thing to deport people who didn't do anything wrong. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=157.33999999999997s)]
*  And who had a good legal reason to be here. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=162.0s)]
*  Even when you don't take the time to figure out which one is which, and you go, who cares? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=165.36s)]
*  Let's just send them back. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=172.20000000000002s)]
*  Well, then by definition, it's wrong. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=174.20000000000002s)]
*  Unless you think I don't care about facts, and I don't care if they're here legally. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=178.08s)]
*  It makes me feel emotionally better if we just punish some random people that don't [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=182.62s)]
*  look like me. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=186.88000000000002s)]
*  These legal immigrants include a temporary visa holder and four men who were authorized [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=187.88000000000002s)]
*  to travel through the United States refugee program. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=192.72s)]
*  By the way, that's how both of my parents came to the United States legally as Armenian [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=196.55999999999997s)]
*  refugees. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=200.95999999999998s)]
*  They were allowed into the country, went through the process, became American citizens, and [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=202.07999999999998s)]
*  contributed to this country, to the economy, as many immigrants do. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=206.2s)]
*  The government vetted these refugees abroad and concluded that they would face persecution, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=211.48s)]
*  letting them settle in the United States. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=216.83999999999997s)]
*  The other 45 legal immigrants scheduled appointments using the CBP-1 app, through which they were [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=219.28s)]
*  permitted to seek entry. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=227.64s)]
*  Among those with appointments, 24 were paroled into the US, where they could live and work [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=229.76s)]
*  legally for up to two years, while the other 21 were detained at the port of entry. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=234.68s)]
*  And it's not just the Cato Institute, by the way, publishing these findings. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=240.24s)]
*  libertarians tend to be in favor of immigration, even illegal immigration, because it helps [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=243.88s)]
*  corporations, let's keep it real. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=250.92000000000002s)]
*  But a Reuters survey of 50 men deported to El Salvador also placed the proportion of [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=252.96s)]
*  those who entered legally at about half. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=258.12s)]
*  So that figure makes sense, because about half of all the Venezuelans who have immigrated [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=261.88s)]
*  to the United States over the past two years came legally as well, either as refugees, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=267.28000000000003s)]
*  parolees, or visa holders. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=272.52000000000004s)]
*  So Trump is saying we temporary protective status from Venezuelan immigrants. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=274.88s)]
*  And so what that means is, since they were fleeing what we considered to be a communist [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=280.72s)]
*  country, we were giving them refuge. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=285.76s)]
*  But Trump has decided that he's not going to give them refuge anymore. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=288.20000000000005s)]
*  That is completely within his power. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=291.24s)]
*  He's allowed to do that. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=293.52000000000004s)]
*  I give you that as an example of, okay, I agree or disagree, that's a thing he's allowed [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=294.52000000000004s)]
*  to do. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=299.76s)]
*  He is not allowed to take people who are here legally and send them to a dungeon in El Salvador. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=300.92s)]
*  That's not close to legal. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=309.12s)]
*  It's not within a million miles of legal. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=311.06s)]
*  And by the way, if you're in the right wing, and you want to send undocumented immigrants [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=312.8s)]
*  back, this is going to set your cause back, because the American people are going to go, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=316.48s)]
*  well now I'm against the program. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=321.36s)]
*  If you're sending people here who are here legally to a dungeon in El Salvador, no, I [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=322.98s)]
*  vote no, right? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=327.56s)]
*  So it's a disaster, it makes no sense at all. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=329.4s)]
*  And it's partly because they're lazy. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=333.7s)]
*  Take the time to find out who's undocumented and who isn't. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=335.76s)]
*  It's not that big an ask. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzBEAjzNwI&t=339.71999999999997s)]
