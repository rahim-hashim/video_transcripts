"Democratic voters prefer a populist message over one that focuses on an "abundance agenda," according to a new poll by Demand Progress.
Why it matters: Democrats are asking themselves some hard questions as they ponder how they lost the 2024 election ‚Äî and consider how they might win in 2028."

# POLL: Democratic Voters Decide...'Populism' Or 'Abundance'
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [May 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc)
*  The answer to a politics of scarcity is a politics of abundance. A politics that asks what it is that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=0.0s)]
*  people really need, and then organizes government and markets to make sure there is enough of it. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=5.84s)]
*  Government is not simply good at all times, it is not simply bad at all times. Sometimes government [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  has to get out of the way. I think that the original progressive populist brand of about [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=16.8s)]
*  100 years ago, we've got to bring that back to the center of what being a progressive is. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=22.88s)]
*  And I hope that that actually helps transform the Democratic Party as well. The point of the [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=27.68s)]
*  Democratic Party is to break the unholy alliance between corporate greed and corrupt government [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=32.48s)]
*  and stop. There's this ongoing debate among the left over what the Democratic Party should focus [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=38.96s)]
*  on moving forward and how they should basically frame their messaging. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=46.96s)]
*  Okay, so there's the so-called abundance crowd led by Ezra Klein and his co-author, Derek Thompson. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=51.92s)]
*  They co-wrote a book called Abundance and it's getting a lot of attention, a lot of backlash from [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=59.760000000000005s)]
*  some on the left and we'll get into that in just a minute. Others want to focus their energy on [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=64.72s)]
*  economic populism. And there's a new survey that found that Democratic voters have [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=69.76s)]
*  chosen a side. My issue though is the framing of this whole thing because it's incredibly dumb. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=76.4s)]
*  You can have progressive policies. You can have the most progressive policies on the planet. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=85.60000000000001s)]
*  But you can't actually effectively implement those progressive policies [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=91.60000000000001s)]
*  when there are regulations that are cynically used to prevent the effective and successful [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=97.28s)]
*  implementation of those policies. So you can literally throw tens of billions of dollars [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=103.28s)]
*  at building affordable housing. But that money goes nowhere if you have homeowners, for instance, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=108.4s)]
*  who cynically use environmental regulations to either slow the process or prevent the process [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=116.72s)]
*  from happening altogether. And that's what Ezra Klein is trying to communicate. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=123.04s)]
*  I've read his book. I don't agree with everything he has in there. I am worried about [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=127.44s)]
*  certain forms of deregulation that will backfire and hurt people for sure. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=132.88s)]
*  However, I also live in California where we have had a severe housing shortage [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=137.67999999999998s)]
*  for a long time that only gets worse. And I see how everything plays out. There's a new housing [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=142.64s)]
*  development that's been voted on. The state legislature will fund it and it never gets built. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=149.04s)]
*  The bullet train that was supposed to go from Los Angeles to San Francisco, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=157.44s)]
*  that's never gonna be built and we keep throwing more money at it. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=163.04s)]
*  And the reason why it's never gonna be built is because again, the same regulations keep [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=166.56s)]
*  getting cited in an effort to prevent the construction of that form of public transit. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=170.64s)]
*  So I just think they're talking over each other and it's driving me crazy because I actually think [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=178.72s)]
*  it's actually important for both sides here to understand that they're both making really good [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=184.4s)]
*  points and one needs the other. You're not gonna be able to implement these progressive policies [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=193.68s)]
*  unless you stop the cynical use of these regulations to serve as obstacles to implementing [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=198.96s)]
*  these policies. That's my take. But no one is talking about it that way. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=205.60000000000002s)]
*  Everyone's talking about it as if it's abundance versus progressive policies. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=209.83999999999997s)]
*  And I just don't think that's the right framing. So as a result, the survey was done of 1200 [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=214.64s)]
*  registered voters. It was commissioned by Demand Progress, which as you can imagine is a progressive [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=220.07999999999998s)]
*  advocacy organization and it's carried out by YouGov. So here's how they define the abundance [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=225.67999999999998s)]
*  argument to survey the respondents. They say the big problem is bottlenecks that make it harder to [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=231.6s)]
*  produce housing, expand energy production or build new roads and bridges. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=237.36s)]
*  Frequently these bottlenecks take the form of well-intentioned regulations meant to give people [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=242.24s)]
*  a voice or to protect the environment. But these regulations are exploited by organized interest [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=248.32000000000002s)]
*  groups and community groups to slow things down. By the way, all the credit to Demand Progress for [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=254.8s)]
*  accurately describing the abundance argument. That is an accurate description, okay? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=260.48s)]
*  This increases costs and makes it harder for us to provide for everybody's needs. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=265.68s)]
*  We need to push back against these groups so that government and economy can work together, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=273.28000000000003s)]
*  or work better I should say, for working and middle class Americans. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=278.48s)]
*  So the survey asked if a candidate for Congress or president made the abundance argument, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=283.04s)]
*  would that make you more likely or less likely to vote for them? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=289.04s)]
*  And let's look at the results. Among Democratic voters only 32.6% said they'd be more likely to [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=292.72s)]
*  vote for that person. I don't think that's surprising when you consider the fact that [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=300.48s)]
*  the Democratic Party has attracted affluent voters, many of whom probably own homes. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=305.76000000000005s)]
*  I mean, they're real. And they hate abundance because they're a bunch of nimbies. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=310.56s)]
*  Let's keep it real, they're nimbies. They don't wanna build the housing developments. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=316.0s)]
*  They don't want it in their backyard, okay? Let's just keep it real. Okay, let me give you more [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=320.47999999999996s)]
*  though. Among independents, the percentage was slightly higher at 40.6%. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=325.44s)]
*  So let's compare that to the populism approach. And by the way, I agree with populists, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=331.44s)]
*  but populists need to understand your policies ain't getting implemented. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=337.67999999999995s)]
*  There will be massive obstacles to it unless we actually address the cynical use of these [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=341.59999999999997s)]
*  regulations to prevent you from effectively implementing your policies. So this is how they [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=347.36s)]
*  defined the populist argument in the survey. The big problem is that big corporations have way too [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=352.88s)]
*  much power over our economy and our government. I agree with that. They work to prevent the [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=359.68s)]
*  government from making investments in things like expanding access to affordable clean energy, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=364.88s)]
*  housing and infrastructure improvements so that they can maximize their own profits. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=370.0s)]
*  Corporations also try to raise prices by as much as they can, which is easier than ever because [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=374.8s)]
*  the economy is so concentrated in the hands of just a few people. We need to hold these [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=381.12s)]
*  corporations accountable and reduce their power so the government and economy can work better [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=386.08s)]
*  for working and middle class Americans. Now asked if they'd be more or less likely to [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=392.40000000000003s)]
*  support a candidate making that populist argument. Here's what the respondents said. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=398.24s)]
*  Okay, so take a look at this. Among Democratic voters, an overwhelming 72.5% [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=403.04s)]
*  said they'd be more likely to vote for that person. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=410.32s)]
*  Among independents, the percentage was slightly lower at 55.4%. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=413.92s)]
*  Finally, given a direct choice, 59% of Democrats preferred the populist argument [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=418.88s)]
*  compared to just 16.8% liking the abundance one. 44.3% of independents also chose populist [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=425.2s)]
*  compared to 28.4% who chose abundance. I think both things are true and no one got an opportunity [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=436.08s)]
*  to vote on that or answer in that way in the survey. But I'm really curious what you think [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=446.96s)]
*  was because I don't think that most people who have been trashing Ezra Klein lately have actually [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=452.48s)]
*  read the book. I think that they just hear the word deregulation and they freak out. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=457.92s)]
*  Yes, that's part of it. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=462.40000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, for good reason, right? Because deregulation has really been this mission of the right [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=463.36s)]
*  for all sorts of nefarious reasons. But again, I also have seen with my own two eyes in the state [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=468.8s)]
*  I live in where those regulations are cynically used by Democrats to kind of gum up the whole [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=476.48s)]
*  system and prevent things from getting better, prevent important housing developments and things [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=483.36s)]
*  like that. So I think there's two ways to look at this or not even two ways. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=488.64000000000004s)]
*  There's one way to look at it. I think Ezra Klein, people look at him I think quite correctly as a [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=495.12s)]
*  neoliberal in the sense that he's just like, yeah, we need to open up the market and the market is [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=501.84s)]
*  going to fix this by itself. I just wholly disagree. I think there just has to be a pairing. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=506.88s)]
*  Ezra Klein needs to admit that the government needs to enact some level of price controls [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=514.64s)]
*  or rent control or whatever the hell you wanna call it. In concert with an opening up of [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=520.16s)]
*  the regulations on housing because there's California with all the NIMBYs. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=529.1999999999999s)]
*  But then I think about New York City where they don't have trouble building in Manhattan when they [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=534.4s)]
*  finally do get to build. And what do they do? They sell it to Saudis to park their money. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=540.88s)]
*  To Chinese people to park their money. To Russian oligarchs to park their money. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=548.0s)]
*  That's what they do with the apartments. Yeah, it needs to be banned. That needs to be banned [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=553.1199999999999s)]
*  full stop. Foreign wealthy people who just wanna park their money in this real estate. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=557.44s)]
*  That would absolutely happen in an unregulated California. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=563.2800000000001s)]
*  Exactly. I agree. No, no, hold on, hold on. That would happen. That's been happening in [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=566.8000000000001s)]
*  California. That's been happening in California. So you wanna talk about deregulation. I just think [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=572.6400000000001s)]
*  it's interesting that like Ezra Klein's very specific about the deregulation he's talking [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=578.32s)]
*  about, right? But when it comes to those who love regulations so much, why aren't they making [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=583.36s)]
*  a big stink about the fact that Saudis or Chinese business people and Russian oligarchs have been [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=589.76s)]
*  buying up residential real estate all over the place? I think that's one of the main. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=596.0s)]
*  And I remember reading about this and it just blew my mind. It was about these ghost apartments [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=600.5600000000001s)]
*  in the west side of Manhattan. Basically like midtown but way out west, like 9th, 10th Avenue, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=606.96s)]
*  all these new high rises that had been built up and they call them ghost apartments. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=613.68s)]
*  And it's like, yeah, these guys that have Russian ties or Chinese ties or whatever, they know [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=618.56s)]
*  one day Putin or the CCP could be like, go screw yourself. We're taking all your stuff. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=626.08s)]
*  Guess what? I got this nest egg in America and in America, my money is going to be safe [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=631.76s)]
*  in that apartment, in that condo, blah, blah, blah. So a lot of people invest in that and those [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=637.84s)]
*  empty apartments that nobody live in, then jack up the rent prices in the surrounding areas, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=643.4399999999999s)]
*  which is just so insanely unfair to the people who live and work in New York City. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=650.72s)]
*  And I think a lot of that, if we just say, let's just take the reins off, let people build, build, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=658.88s)]
*  build, which I think would be great. I think we do need more housing. I think a lot of that, man, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=664.48s)]
*  a lot of times they end up, they just gonna sell some foreigners, bro. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=668.8s)]
*  There's gonna be a bunch of Emiratis with cribs out here. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=672.24s)]
*  You make a really good point. And by the way, I think I have some credit on this because it's [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=675.6s)]
*  an issue that I've been talking about on the show for years. Yeah, and so I think what Ezra Klein [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=681.04s)]
*  said about how regulations aren't by definition good or bad, it depends. So yeah, there needs [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=688.72s)]
*  to be regulation preventing these business interests in foreign countries, buying up [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=696.64s)]
*  residential real estate that should absolutely be reserved for Americans who need housing at a time [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=702.32s)]
*  when we have a severe housing shortage. At the same time though, the high speed rail in California, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=707.6800000000001s)]
*  I love that Ezra Klein keeps bringing up that specific example. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=715.76s)]
*  Because it has been many, many years, the costs have inflated significantly for that project. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=719.6s)]
*  Originally it was supposed to take people from LA to San Francisco. Now it's just gonna be from, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=726.64s)]
*  I forget, I think it might be- [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=734.3199999999999s)]
*  Like- [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=735.92s)]
*  LA to Bakersfield? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=736.64s)]
*  Yeah, LA to- I mean, no offense to Bakersfield, but we're not dying for a public transit option [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=738.8s)]
*  to take us straight to Bakersfield. That's not what voters in California voted on. That's not [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=748.0s)]
*  what they were willing to fund. And look, part of me wants to strangle people like Gavin Newsom, [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=755.5999999999999s)]
*  who's gonna throw an additional billion dollars a year at that project that seems to be going [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=763.04s)]
*  absolutely nowhere. But the underlying issue isn't Newsom, and it isn't the fact that we don't have [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=767.76s)]
*  politicians who are willing to spend the money on these things. They are. In California, they [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=776.8s)]
*  literally are willing to spend the money. It's just that there are all sorts of property owners [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=781.8399999999999s)]
*  all across the state that wanna- They just wanna protect what they have, right? That's the way they [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=788.24s)]
*  think of it. So they don't want riff raff in their neighborhoods. They don't want congestion in their [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=794.8s)]
*  neighborhoods. And look, to some level, I get it. I live in LA. I get how frustrating the congestion [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=802.0s)]
*  can be. Sometimes I just wanna go out and walk my dog without the freaking couple with their two [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=810.96s)]
*  golden retrievers who don't understand. I don't want your dogs near my dog because my dog doesn't [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=817.04s)]
*  wanna be near your dogs. Can you just keep your distance? I get it. However, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=821.9200000000001s)]
*  you live in a society, okay? You live in a city. And if you've made the decision to live in a city, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=828.5600000000001s)]
*  then you have to absorb the good and the bad. And sometimes the bad is that there are a lot of other [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=836.16s)]
*  people who live in that city and a lot of them need housing. And if you stand in the way of that [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=841.9200000000001s)]
*  housing, well, then you're gonna be surrounded by encampments. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=845.68s)]
*  And I don't wanna hear any complaining from the NIMBY crowd about the encampments when you're [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=849.8399999999999s)]
*  standing in the way and you're cynically using environmental regulations to prevent the development [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=856.16s)]
*  of housing that we desperately need. That's what Ezra Klein is trying to get at. And I don't know [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=861.04s)]
*  why it's so offensive to people. It's either because they didn't actually read his book or [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=865.12s)]
*  they're adding arguments to what he's saying that he's not actually saying. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=870.24s)]
*  You get what I'm saying? Yeah, I think the arguments against it is just a feeling. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=875.76s)]
*  And I think people are like, you're not dealing with the corporate power [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=880.4s)]
*  in this equation in the same way that you're dealing with the regulatory bodies. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=886.8s)]
*  Yeah, that's a fair argument. And that's what I think people are [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=891.68s)]
*  pissed off about. It's like, yeah, but those corporate interests, boy, they will gum up all [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=894.48s)]
*  kinds of works for us normal working people. And there's a feeling that he saves his ire [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=901.2800000000001s)]
*  for the regulatory kind of folks and doesn't address the corporate interests, which again, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=908.1600000000001s)]
*  if you have a standing assumption that Ezra Klein is kind of like neoliberal scum, I'm not [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=916.1600000000001s)]
*  completely against you. I just think that he's gotten better on that stuff than he was, say, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=921.84s)]
*  during the first Obama administration. I totally agree with you on that. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=928.32s)]
*  I just think you can critique where he falls short, and I agree with that critique. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=935.6800000000001s)]
*  I think that the corporate influence is an important thing to tackle. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=941.36s)]
*  However, don't throw the baby out with the bathwater because what he's saying about the [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=945.9200000000001s)]
*  exploit exploitation of these regulations is accurate. And I think that for whatever reason, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=951.2800000000001s)]
*  the left has generally rejected that when it's just demonstrably true. And he gives specific [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=958.1600000000001s)]
*  examples of it in his book that bolster the argument he's making. So yeah, that's my take on [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=964.1600000000001s)]
*  it. I think this survey just doesn't frame the question effectively because it's either or [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=969.9200000000001s)]
*  for the respondents. And I don't think it needs to be either or. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=976.96s)]
*  I think the two sides actually have to work together in order to accomplish what we're [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=979.76s)]
*  trying to accomplish. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L3biTqFivc&t=983.2s)]
