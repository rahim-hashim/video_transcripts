"Facing a deadline from an immigration judge to turn over evidence for its attempted deportation of Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil, the federal government has instead submitted a brief memo, signed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, citing the Trump administration‚Äôs authority to expel noncitizens whose presence in the country damages U.S. foreign policy interests."

# Judge Rules Mahmoud Khalil CAN Be Deported
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [April 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw)
*  That is a remarkably stunning proposition, right? It's a very aggressive proposition [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=0.0s)]
*  by the government that essentially because Marco Rubio says so, a green card holder, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=7.08s)]
*  a permanent resident of the United States can be taken into detention and found removable [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  simply because Marco Rubio says so in a two page memo. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  What Mahmoud Khalil was saying and what other student activists and students who have been [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=20.6s)]
*  detained or at a spread of detention were saying was really very basic and uncontroversial [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=25.68s)]
*  that Palestinians deserve to live, that they have human rights too. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=30.68s)]
*  So that in that clip was a lawyer from Mahmoud Khalil responding to Marco Rubio's memo, which [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=34.96s)]
*  we're gonna break down here. But the story has been developing throughout the day. We [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=39.519999999999996s)]
*  had been expecting a Louisiana immigration judge to rule on whether or not Khalil could [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=43.4s)]
*  be deported from America despite being a legal resident simply because Marco Rubio disagrees [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=48.239999999999995s)]
*  with positions that Khalil has taken, things that Khalil has said. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=54.779999999999994s)]
*  And regrettably, the path has now been cleared for that to actually happen despite the government [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=58.5s)]
*  doing a clownish job of making the case for why that incredible and radical step needs [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=62.78s)]
*  to be taken. So we're gonna take you through all of this and try to figure out where we [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=70.34s)]
*  go from here. But the judge we're talking about is Assistant Chief Immigration Judge [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=73.94s)]
*  Jamie Cummins. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=78.52s)]
*  She stated or Jamie stated in this hearing that she had no authority to question Marco [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=80.39999999999999s)]
*  Rubio's determination of the need to deport Khalil. So what's the evidence for this? Everybody's [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=85.44s)]
*  been wondering. We've been told that this person could be a terrorist for all we know, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=91.56s)]
*  imminent threat to America. So Cummins had ordered the government to turn over any evidence [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=95.72s)]
*  supporting the deportation order and people were wondering, was there an assault? Was [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=100.64s)]
*  their property damaged? Was there a death threat made against a Jewish student? No evidence [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=104.44000000000001s)]
*  was actually turned over. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=109.44000000000001s)]
*  All that was turned over was the two page memo being referenced in that video. And that [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=110.64s)]
*  memo does not even allege any criminal conduct by Khalil, not even an accusation. Okay, and [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=114.60000000000001s)]
*  remember, this is a legal permanent US resident graduate student who was just doing what Americans [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=120.28s)]
*  do, which is speak out and organize around issues they care about. So all Rubio did was [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=126.84s)]
*  argue that he could be expelled simply for his beliefs and his speech. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=132.48s)]
*  He said that while Khalil's activities were quote, otherwise lawful, letting him remain [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=138.1s)]
*  in the US would undermine quote US policy to combat anti-Semitism around the world and [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=143.2s)]
*  in the United States. In addition to efforts to protect Jewish students from harassment [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=148.6s)]
*  and violence in the United States. And he added that condoning anti-Semitic conduct, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=152.92s)]
*  which they're not even describing. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=158.08s)]
*  There's no evidence of anti-Semitic content except the fact that he advocates for Palestinian [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=160.32000000000002s)]
*  lives, their ability to continue to exist without being murdered. That by itself is [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=165.8s)]
*  just that's all the evidence you need, that he is an imminent threat to the lives of Jewish [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=171.04000000000002s)]
*  students. And so the judge ruled that the government had met the burden of evidence [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=175.28s)]
*  that the law requires. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=180.52s)]
*  That letter that just says his beliefs are enough, that's the burden of evidence that [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=182.48000000000002s)]
*  the judge was waiting to see met. And no other evidence was provided by Homeland Security. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=187.2s)]
*  No documents, nothing, that's it. And so that's not it for the deportation. He's gonna have [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=193.56s)]
*  a little period of time to appeal that the appeal will definitely happen. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=199.88s)]
*  But this is one of these hard lines that we've been waiting to see whether the government [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=204.22s)]
*  would cross. I've been trying to raise awareness about the true cancel culture, the true word [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=209.32s)]
*  police, the true thought police in America. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=215.12s)]
*  Yeah, I know, I know, right wingers, you make a joke and someone on Twitter calls you a [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=217.36s)]
*  racist and that's really inconvenient. Have you been deported for your jokes? That's what [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=220.8s)]
*  the true cancel culture looks like when you get sent to Syria or Algeria. They haven't [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=225.44s)]
*  even decided where, just one of those two countries. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=229.84s)]
*  They're not even close to each other, just send them to one of them or whatever, because [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=232.52s)]
*  he held a position that the government doesn't think is politically correct. And so I think [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=236.04000000000002s)]
*  of this as a particularly dark day for America. And by the way, if the only allegation you [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=240.12s)]
*  need to be made is their mere existence here hurts our abstract goal of combating anti-Semitism [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=244.8s)]
*  worldwide. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=251.08s)]
*  Well, then why would that only be undocumented migrants or green card holders? What about [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=252.08s)]
*  a US citizen that was advocating for Palestinian lives? Why would that not in the same way [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=257.64s)]
*  hurt this pressing international campaign that Marco Rubio is so passionate about? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=262.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=267.16s)]
*  And so today it's a green card holder that a judge's agreeing can be deported. It could [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=268.16s)]
*  very well be a US citizen tomorrow. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=271.16s)]
*  Yeah, and actually US citizens have started to get stopped at the airports, including [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=273.4s)]
*  lawyers for some of the peace protesters. Total American citizens, they're like, all [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=280.2s)]
*  right, give me your phone. We wanna see if you criticize Israel or if any of your clients [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=285.08s)]
*  criticize Israel. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=289.0s)]
*  So that's it, now you're under investigation. Okay, so this is the Israeli thought police [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=290.53999999999996s)]
*  running our government. There's no question about it. I could prove it definitively in [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=296.88s)]
*  one second. First of all, though you have to know there's two different issues in this [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=300.96s)]
*  case. So the one is whether Mahmoud Khalil is guilty of anything. The other is, is this [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=304.36s)]
*  law constitutional? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=311.86s)]
*  So on the issue whether he's guilty of anything, that jury has come in. Absolutely not, because [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=313.62s)]
*  the government came in and had an opportunity to present evidence. And their evidence was [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=319.68s)]
*  literally nothing, just Rubio's statement saying, I think he's hurting national security [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=324.47999999999996s)]
*  by being quote unquote anti-Semitic. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=331.84s)]
*  By the way, and the government admitted he has committed no crime. And remember, he's [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=334.23999999999995s)]
*  not on a visa. He's a legal resident alien, okay? Meaning that he's on his way to becoming [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=339.84s)]
*  a US citizen. And he's supposed to have almost every right a US citizen has other than voting, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=346.76s)]
*  okay? And so he should be fully protected by the US Constitution and whatever laws apply [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=352.4s)]
*  to him when it comes to freedom of speech also apply to American citizens. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=357.88s)]
*  So if you say, yeah, whatever, foreigner, man, I don't care that there's no evidence, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=361.68s)]
*  just kick him out. Okay, but you're taking away your own rights and you're signing them [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=365.44s)]
*  away so that no one is allowed to criticize Israel. Is it worth it? Is that the big goal? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=370.64s)]
*  Oh my God, we stopped criticism of Israel. America is safe and first, is it? Okay, so [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=376.12s)]
*  and now at some point the lawyer for the government comically says, well, yeah, but [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=383.08s)]
*  we also submitted some evidence to the court that is not public. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=388.03999999999996s)]
*  And Alil's lawyer is like, really, where is it? Because obviously his lawyer can see it. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=391.47999999999996s)]
*  Like it's somewhere. But any evidence, they admit he committed no crime. They have, by the way, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=397.71999999999997s)]
*  they were saying in the beginning, well, aligned with Hamas ideologically or something. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=404.36s)]
*  Now this time around they're asked, hey, is he aligned with Hamas? You have evidence, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=410.2s)]
*  cuz that would be really, really important. No, he's not. They don't mention it at all, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=413.40000000000003s)]
*  not aligned with Hamas, not aligned with terrorism. They made up everything. And they say, no, no, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=418.52000000000004s)]
*  no, but he's an anti-Semite. He literally went on TV and spoke out against anti-Semitism. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=423.16s)]
*  So like 100% cuz he spoke out against Israel, having nothing to do with any other issue. Now [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=428.2s)]
*  it connected to things. So the judge says, look, I get it. This guy who presented no evidence at all. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=440.28s)]
*  But the law, this 1952 law says, if the Secretary of State thinks that someone's a national security [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=448.36s)]
*  threat just because of any reason, any reason at all, because they had a peanut butter and [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=454.92s)]
*  jelly sandwich and Marco Rubio thought, you know what, that bothers me. That's a national security [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=460.68s)]
*  threat. I don't have a choice. He's allergic. And she said, especially because she's an [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=465.64000000000004s)]
*  immigration judge. So this gets to the silver lining, right? No silver lining, just like hope [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=470.36s)]
*  that it can be reversed. So she's like, I literally can't decide if this law is unconstitutional. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=475.48s)]
*  You have to go to the regular courts, right? Not the immigration courts inside that. As an [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=482.36s)]
*  immigration judge, all I'm saying is, you're right that 1952 law exists. You're right. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=487.08000000000004s)]
*  In that law, the Secretary of State can say, he looked at my wife funny. I think he's a national [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=493.32s)]
*  security threat. He's out of the country, right? So he's running against me in Florida. That's it. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=499.0s)]
*  He's out of the country for any reason. So her hand is tied. I don't blame her for the decision. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=504.04s)]
*  But in the regular courts, and it's in New Jersey now because it was picked up [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=510.52s)]
*  in that area and then transferred to Louisiana. And so that's going through the federal court [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=514.44s)]
*  system. That's where they have to decide, is this law unconstitutional? Because if you allow this [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=519.48s)]
*  law to continue and say it is constitutional, then there goes freedom of speech. Because the [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=526.2s)]
*  courts have said that legal resident aliens, green card holders have the same exact freedom [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=532.92s)]
*  of speech rights as US citizens. So if they say, okay, according to this law, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=539.32s)]
*  Secretary of State can make up any reason at all and you're a goner. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=544.6s)]
*  Well, that means the Secretary of State can throw out anyone he wants from the country [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=549.0s)]
*  for any reason. And yes, because they're using their constitutionally protected speech. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=553.6400000000001s)]
*  And again, if you're on the right wing and you say, well, I don't care about no stinking evidence, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=560.6800000000001s)]
*  that law exists and I just want to throw them all out. He looks Muslim or whatever that he does. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=565.56s)]
*  Or you know what, I love Israel and I don't think any American or any [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=570.52s)]
*  legal resident of America should be allowed to criticize Israel. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=574.8399999999999s)]
*  It hurts my feelings slightly. So that's it, throw them out. Okay, but you can't say you're [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=578.04s)]
*  for free speech. That's it, period, period. There's no argument for, even if you think, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=584.04s)]
*  the Supreme Court's been wrong for 200 years straight. The Constitution shouldn't apply to [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=590.76s)]
*  Americans citizens. I know better than the Supreme Court. Okay, all right, even so, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=595.24s)]
*  what you're saying is, I don't want him to have speech rights. I don't like freedom of speech. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=599.72s)]
*  I don't like anyone having the ability to criticize this foreign government. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=605.48s)]
*  So I hate free speech. That's why I want this guy kicked out. Be honest about it. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=610.12s)]
*  It is literally impossible to be in favor of free speech and say that he should be kicked out [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=615.48s)]
*  for his speech against Israel. Literally impossible. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=620.92s)]
*  Okay, so you gotta make up your mind. Do you hate free speech or do you want him to stay? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=625.16s)]
*  This law is obviously unconstitutional, obviously. Now whether the Supreme Court [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=629.48s)]
*  thinks it's as obvious as we do is going to be an open question. Because Clarence Thomas and Alito [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=635.9599999999999s)]
*  are gonna wanna kick him out, right? But the Supreme Court just did rule nine to nothing [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=642.52s)]
*  on the El Salvador case saying, no, you gotta bring him back. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=650.04s)]
*  So there's nuance to that, but overall, they just said unanimously, even Clarence Thomas saying, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=654.04s)]
*  no, he's innocent. You really gotta bring him back, right? You had no legal authority to send him. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=660.04s)]
*  So will the courts hold in that regard? Well, that's everything. Because if they don't hold [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=665.48s)]
*  on this, they're basically saying that's it. You can round them up. Now for those of you [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=669.0799999999999s)]
*  who are Israeli supporters and any criticism of Israel, including what we've just said here, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=673.56s)]
*  ruffles your feathers and you're like the 50,000 dead people are not that, 15,000 dead children, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=679.24s)]
*  not that important. But my feather is very important, right? And this is ruffling my feathers. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=684.28s)]
*  And you shouldn't be allowed to do that. And Cenk, you saying that this is just about Israel [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=688.68s)]
*  and the Israeli thought police. Well, that's very anti-Semitic to say that, right? [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=694.28s)]
*  Okay, but Rubio could have put literally anything in that letter as justification to kick him out. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=700.1999999999999s)]
*  He could have put, and remember it's all invented, the guy's actually against anti-Semitism. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=708.44s)]
*  So he could have put, this guy hates America. That's why I'm kicking him out. This guy hates [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=713.0s)]
*  Norway. That's why I'm kicking him out. This guy is hurting our national security [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=718.2800000000001s)]
*  because he once looked at a military facility. He could have written anything. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=723.24s)]
*  What was the one thing he wrote? Anti-Semitism. Okay, that's it. No one should be allowed to [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=727.48s)]
*  criticize Israel. And I'm gonna call it anti-Semitism, even though the guy's the opposite. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=733.48s)]
*  So if you're still pretending that Israel doesn't control our politicians, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=738.44s)]
*  I mean, you can pretend all you like, but the jury's in. Everyone knows, literally everyone knows [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=744.36s)]
*  that Israel controls America. So Biden gave him a blank check, let them do whatever the hell they [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=751.24s)]
*  wanted. Kamala Harris could have won Michigan, could have at least picked up a lot of votes [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=756.6s)]
*  if she just disagreed with Israel an inch, an inch. Nope, nope, nope, bow down to Israel. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=761.96s)]
*  Now Trump comes in, he's like, you think you guys are Israeli ass kissers? Hold my beer, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=768.04s)]
*  okay? Watch me now. And Rubio, what did I tell you about Rubio? The minute he was announced as [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=774.1999999999999s)]
*  the Secretary of State, I said that's a Miriam Adelson pick. He's a neocon, and his only job [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=780.28s)]
*  is to protect Israel, not America. And boom, right here in that letter, don't give a damn about [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=786.5999999999999s)]
*  America or anything else. Israel, Israel, Israel, they're the kings. And this guy [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=791.8s)]
*  dared to criticize them. Get them out of the country even though it destroys [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=796.68s)]
*  freedom of speech in America. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=801.0s)]
*  ‚Äî Man, the hypocrisy is not lost on me that the party that calls themselves [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=802.2s)]
*  extinguishing DEI all over the country and in the government realistically just switched out the I [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=809.16s)]
*  in DEI with Israel. Where the same people that used to cry about safe spaces on campus, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=815.8s)]
*  used to cry about trigger warnings, used to cry about all the free speech that's being stifled [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=822.92s)]
*  on campus are lining up right now to see this kid get deported. This dude get deported [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=829.16s)]
*  because he opposes the Israeli regime and their management of the conflict in Gaza. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=836.1999999999999s)]
*  It's really quite stunning. And just the idea, just think about it. Let's just say [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=842.4399999999999s)]
*  some immigrants stood on the corner and protested the drone war in Yemen or the drone war in places [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=847.96s)]
*  in East Africa, like Somalia and stuff like that, that we're carrying out, right? Would they be [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=857.24s)]
*  deported? No, no. And what they would be doing is opposing the way that the US military is conducting [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=863.0s)]
*  a war and nobody would ever say that the US military and their actions and every single thing [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=873.4s)]
*  that they do is somehow a perfect representation of every single American. And therefore condemning [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=879.0799999999999s)]
*  the US military and its actions, like if you condemned Abu Ghraib or if you condemned [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=884.84s)]
*  Mili or if you condemned any of the atrocities, countless atrocities that the American military [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=892.52s)]
*  has ever committed that you were somehow condemning every single American citizen. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=899.4s)]
*  Nobody said that because it's ridiculous. Nobody would buy that. Nobody would go for that. And the [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=903.64s)]
*  only thing that I'm heartened by is like their time is running out. The Democrats, the base, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=909.3199999999999s)]
*  have completely, completely turned against the Israeli regime and their war in Gaza. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=915.56s)]
*  And I would say, shoot, man, I'd be surprised if most Republicans [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=921.56s)]
*  even support what the Israelis are doing in Gaza. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=925.0s)]
*  Yeah. Look, that's what I keep saying and everybody's skeptical about it. And I get it, [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=927.72s)]
*  in the beginning, the Trump guys, especially the loud ones that are MAGA online, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=932.4399999999999s)]
*  come in roaring, who cares? Kick him out of the country. He's an immigrant, right? But no, [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=937.16s)]
*  I see tons and tons of right wingers. In fact, there's a great example of that today, [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=943.16s)]
*  the Dave Smith Douglas Murray debate on Joe Rogan, right? [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=947.3199999999999s)]
*  I don't know if you guys have seen this, but Douglas Murray is an Israeli propagandist [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=951.24s)]
*  and he's like a smug prick and he goes around and go, did you know? I've been in Israel. I went [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=955.16s)]
*  on an IDF marketing tour in Israel. So I'm the only expert. I'm the only expert, right? [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=961.3199999999999s)]
*  And he went and tried that crap on Joe Rogan and Dave Smith batted him around a little bit. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=967.0799999999999s)]
*  And the entire right wing internet, other than the Israeli supporters, are like, yeah, [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=971.4s)]
*  that wasn't close. Dave Smith is definitely right. And Douglas Murray is a giant D back, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=976.12s)]
*  okay? So they're losing the right guys. I know for those of you, look, that's great news [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=982.12s)]
*  because, and remember, the left, God, we need more power. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=988.84s)]
*  The populist left never actually gets into power and it's so frustrating. But unfortunately, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=994.2s)]
*  in this country, the right wing has infinite power. So Israel is playing with fire. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=999.16s)]
*  So they keep antagonizing the right wing. America second, America second, Israel first, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=1005.48s)]
*  right? Poke the bear, poke the bear and see how it turns out for you. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=1012.2s)]
*  Because when you lose the right wing in America, you're in a world of hurt. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=1016.76s)]
*  So and especially to Waz's point, the left is already gone. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=1020.28s)]
*  And look, I don't know anyone who wasn't already an Israeli supporter who now thinks, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=1024.2s)]
*  oh, Israel's right. I mean, they just haven't killed enough Palestinians. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=1029.16s)]
*  Okay, I just wanted one quick thing and this is maybe about the poke and the bear thing. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=1032.1200000000001s)]
*  And to Waz's point, there's all these people that are like, I deeply love free speech, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=1037.72s)]
*  also deport him for his beliefs. Okay, well, let's say that this stands and the Supreme Court [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=1041.64s)]
*  doesn't overturn it and establishes that if the Secretary of State thinks that we need to [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=1047.16s)]
*  combat anti-Semitism, then we just start shipping out anti-Semites. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=1052.44s)]
*  I think the right might want to think twice about that because while they point to saying [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=1057.5600000000002s)]
*  don't kill Palestinian kids as anti-Semitism, you want to start talking about actual anti-Semitism [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=1061.96s)]
*  in this country? You think the right is clean on that? Maybe the next time they start chanting, [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=1066.52s)]
*  the Jews shall not replace us, we gasp up the plane. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=1071.56s)]
*  John, I promise. I'll point them out by name. I'll start snitching quick. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=1073.96s)]
*  Oh, yeah, no, it's not hard. They march in the streets, ship them out of here. Glenn Beck with [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=1078.76s)]
*  his blackboard of Jewish billionaires, the cabal, seems anti-Semitic, get them out of here. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=1085.56s)]
*  Alex Jones is probably spreading an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=1090.28s)]
*  literally as we're recording this. Marjorie Green with her Jewish space lasers, that is [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=1093.24s)]
*  materially combating our ability to fight anti-Semitism worldwide. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=1098.68s)]
*  Deport her ass, get her out of here, ship her to Moscow or El Salvador or whatever. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=1103.32s)]
*  If it turns out that this is totally cool, totally constitutional, then let's learn lessons from this [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=1107.32s)]
*  and start combating anti-Semitism by shipping out all these actual anti-Semites. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=1113.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=1117.24s)]
*  I'm mostly sarcastic there. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=1118.68s)]
*  Look, we've been principled and consistent throughout. We actually believe in the First [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=1120.6s)]
*  Amendment. We believe in freedom of speech and we believe in America and we believe that we [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAwAikITalw&t=1126.1200000000001s)]
