# Senate Republicans GUT No Tax on Tips or Overtime Promise
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q)
*  There are many legs to your economic plan that you're laying out. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=0.0s)]
*  That's big. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=3.52s)]
*  No tax on tips, no tax on social security benefits for seniors, which is so great. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=4.32s)]
*  Think of it and no tax on overtime. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=10.16s)]
*  The certainty that we will see no tax on tips become the law of the land, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=12.24s)]
*  I think is very close to 100%. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=18.0s)]
*  Except it's not close to 100% because those are the tax cuts that are on the chopping block now [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=19.52s)]
*  that the bill has made its way to the Senate. Are you surprised, Was? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=27.52s)]
*  No, I'm not surprised that the tax cut designed to shovel wealth up from the bottom to the top [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=30.8s)]
*  will not benefit those at the bottom. Yep, exactly. So look, as we suspected, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  the Republicans are considering essentially taking a hatchet to the few parts of this so-called [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=46.16s)]
*  Big Beautiful bill that would actually benefit working people, working Americans. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=53.44s)]
*  And the vast majority of jobs in America now are in the service sector. A lot of these people get [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=58.72s)]
*  paid a wage, usually it's minimum wage or even lower than that, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=64.48s)]
*  and make the bulk of their income through tips. Now, the House version of the Big Beautiful bill [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=69.28s)]
*  included a tax. Basically, the first $25,000 a service worker makes would not be [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=75.28s)]
*  taxed through tips, right? That they make through tips would not be taxed. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=83.52s)]
*  Now that looks like it's not gonna make it in the final bill because senators [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=88.8s)]
*  wanna get rid of it. Now, why do they wanna get rid of it? Well, because [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=92.88s)]
*  days after the Congressional Budget Office put out their estimate that the spending bill [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=96.32s)]
*  would in fact increase the federal deficit by 2.41 trillion. Politico is now reporting that [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=100.8s)]
*  Senate finance Republicans are looking to scale back these key provisions on Trump's [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=108.16s)]
*  tax policy wish list. And exacerbating that deficit issue, according to Politico, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=113.36s)]
*  is that the House version of this mega bill would restore tax incentives for research and development, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=120.24s)]
*  business equipment, and debt interest through 2029, which Trump has indicated he supports. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=127.68s)]
*  However, that's not good enough for the senators. They wanna give more goodies and cookies to their [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=134.64000000000001s)]
*  donors. So Senate Republicans are dead set on making them permanent, not just to 2029, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=140.16s)]
*  but permanent. And that's obviously gonna make the bill a lot more costly. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=148.24s)]
*  So to offset that cost, okay, the GOP senators are looking to water down [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=153.44000000000003s)]
*  other tax provisions they believe aren't as pro-growth. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=159.44000000000003s)]
*  Let's stop and talk about more money in our pockets. And by the way, I'm not even in the [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=163.92000000000002s)]
*  service sector, so it's not gonna benefit me. I don't care. I still think that that's one of the [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=168.8s)]
*  provisions in the bill that's important to keep. I want ordinary working Americans to enjoy tax [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=173.68s)]
*  cuts so they have more money in their pockets so they can go out there and do what? Stimulate the [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=180.4s)]
*  economy, okay? Because businesses, billionaires, millionaires, they're not stimulating the economy. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=185.44s)]
*  They're hoarding their wealth. So you wanna talk about growth? Let's talk about the people who [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=191.84s)]
*  actually spend their money, and that's working class Americans. I'm so sick of this narrative. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=197.20000000000002s)]
*  It's so disgusting. But nonetheless, those policies include no tax on tips, no taxes on overtime, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=201.84s)]
*  and tax relief for seniors. Those are all considered anti-pro-growth tax cuts. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=207.76s)]
*  All proposals Trump touted on the campaign trail and collectively boost or boast a price tag of [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=215.28s)]
*  roughly $230 billion, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=221.51999999999998s)]
*  Some senators have also recommended cuts to Medicare or the Federal Reserve. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=227.68s)]
*  Of course, they want to cut Medicare. It's the least surprising thing ever. But of course, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=233.92s)]
*  if they really wanted to reduce the impact of this bill or the impact it'll have on the deficit, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=238.16s)]
*  they would target other tax breaks that were implemented dating back to 2017. Take a look. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=244.64s)]
*  Republicans are, in fact, adding some new tax cuts here. Those are the no taxes on tips, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=252.16s)]
*  overtime, some benefits for seniors. These tax cuts are significant. However, they pale in [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=258.8s)]
*  comparison to the biggest cost in the bill. That is extending those Trump tax cuts. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=264.16s)]
*  Altogether, the Congressional Budget Office says the tax cuts in this bill add up to $3.7 trillion. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=268.72s)]
*  Tax cuts in this bill add up to $3.7 trillion. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=273.84s)]
*  Abolish Congress. We're having a conversation about abolishing, guys. No, abolish Congress. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=276.71999999999997s)]
*  Abolish Congress. Useless scum, okay? Congress is so useless. I can't stand them. I can't [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=290.32s)]
*  stand them, Woz. I can't stand them. Anyway, what's the point of Congress? All they do, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=298.08s)]
*  they've got corporate genitals shoved down their throat. They can't get enough of it, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=304.16s)]
*  okay? I'm just keeping it 100. They don't do jack for us. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=309.6s)]
*  Nothing. Nothing for the American people. Nothing for ordinary American workers. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=312.96s)]
*  All they do is facilitate elatio on behalf of their donors. That's what they do. Democrats, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=317.36s)]
*  Republicans, doesn't matter, with the exception of a handful of people. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=323.04s)]
*  If that, I can't stand them. Woz, take it away. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=326.96s)]
*  Yeah, it's quite grotesque what they're doing with this bill. And again, the indoctrination [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=329.84s)]
*  that we've all been under, this idea that growth and GDP and these economic indicators that [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=339.67999999999995s)]
*  give us the indication of what a quote unquote healthy economy possesses. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=348.56s)]
*  Words like, and it's like, yeah, of course. And the average person is like, yeah, of course, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=354.24s)]
*  I wanna grow the economy. Yeah, of course, GDP growth sounds great. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=358.32s)]
*  Just ask yourself guys, decades of growth, GDP growth in this country, who has the benefits [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=363.28s)]
*  of this economy accrued to? We know the answer. It's not the median worker. It's just not. We [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=371.68s)]
*  know wages have been stagnant while growth in the economy, in the GDP, in the profit margins of [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=378.24s)]
*  every single major industry has grown exponentially. And so where has that growth gone? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=385.76s)]
*  It hasn't gone into infrastructure of the country, making people's lives better, investment [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=392.64s)]
*  in our people here. It's just gone into the pockets of the people who are already doing the [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=401.12s)]
*  best among us. And again, man, just the idea that these people don't mind leaking, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=407.04s)]
*  that they're thinking about cutting Medicaid, Medicare, okay, in order so that people that [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=412.40000000000003s)]
*  are earning a wage of like 1.5 million could get 400K back. It's like, it's moving. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=419.28000000000003s)]
*  See, aside from the taxes we pay for social security and the taxes we pay for Medicare, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=425.12s)]
*  and you can see it on your pay stub. You can see how much you're contributing to those universal, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=433.2s)]
*  very popular programs. Aside from that, I wanna understand what the F am I paying taxes for? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=438.71999999999997s)]
*  What am I paying taxes? Maybe, consider this, maybe if the rich and corporations were funding [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=444.8s)]
*  Israel's genocide to the extent that all of us workers are, maybe there would be some breaks [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=452.64s)]
*  on that car, maybe. Maybe. I'm disgusted by this, Was. What the F am I paying my taxes for? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=458.56s)]
*  And that's another thing, one of the other biggest line items on the budget, of course. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=468.4s)]
*  We have a trillion point one or trillion point two five military budget. That's just for one year. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=473.52s)]
*  You see those two, that number that you saw 3.7 trillion, that's over 10 years. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=482.24s)]
*  The military budget is a trillion for one. We're increasing the budget, and for what? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=488.48s)]
*  We're putting more money in Lockheed and Raytheon's pockets, and for what? Nobody can explain it to us. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=496.32s)]
*  We spent a trillion dollars last year to service the United States debt. So we've got over a trillion [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=505.04s)]
*  dollars on defense spending, okay? A trillion dollars on servicing our debt. Why do we have [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=511.59999999999997s)]
*  debt in the first place? Part of the reason why we have debt is because of these deep [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=517.52s)]
*  tax cuts for corporations and the rich. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=521.2s)]
*  And Republicans love to talk about, we're really screwed over future generations. And they are, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=524.16s)]
*  they're not even just screwing over future generations. This generation is screwed. We're [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=529.68s)]
*  already spending a trillion dollars to service our debt. This generation is screwed. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=533.6s)]
*  But it's screwed at the behest of the haves and at the detriment of the have nots. How is that fair? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=538.08s)]
*  How is that fair? It's so disgusting, Was. It's so disgusting. Now, beyond the fact that, look, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=546.96s)]
*  targeting the few good provisions that benefit working people isn't really the best way or the [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=554.96s)]
*  most effective way to save money. These Republicans are also risking upsetting their daddy, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=560.56s)]
*  Donald Trump. We'll see, though, we'll see. He campaigned aggressively on no tax on tips. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=565.28s)]
*  But did he really mean it? Now, Ways and Means Chair Representative Jason Smith says, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=570.9599999999999s)]
*  I think that the United States Senate will not want to scale down the president's priorities. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=577.5999999999999s)]
*  No tax on tips, no tax on overtime. And are two of his top priorities. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=582.7199999999999s)]
*  Are there some tweaks that they can do to it that I would recommend? Yes, and I have recommended. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=590.0s)]
*  But some state Senate Republicans who sit on that finance panel have come out more forcibly [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=597.12s)]
*  against the popular policy. So for instance, of course, it's Ron Johnson. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=603.5999999999999s)]
*  When Politico asked Senator Ron Johnson whether he believes no tax on tips or no tax on overtime [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=608.4s)]
*  are pro growth, he gave a terse nope. That's right, because he's got his, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=614.0s)]
*  we keep it classy and move on. Senator Tom Tillis is arguing that no tax on overtime [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=623.12s)]
*  should be rewritten so it only applies to people working over 40 hours. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=628.48s)]
*  Working over 40 hours a week. What do you think overtime is, you piece of sh- [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=636.32s)]
*  Mm-hm. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=640.4000000000001s)]
*  These people are so out of touch with ordinary people, it's amazing. Senators Rand Paul, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=643.36s)]
*  Mike Lee and Rick Scott have also said that the legislation doesn't have enough money or save [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=647.6s)]
*  enough money, I should say, and are threatening to vote against it. Just vote against it. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=652.5600000000001s)]
*  Just vote against it. Vote against it, let's stop pretending like you're gonna vote against it, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=657.2s)]
*  but ultimately you're gonna vote in favor of it, okay? If you're gonna vote against it, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=662.32s)]
*  then just do it and shut the F up. But this whole thing- [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=666.8s)]
*  Well, the legislation, Ana, doesn't save enough money because you're slashing [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=669.68s)]
*  revenues. That's why it's the tax cut. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=676.16s)]
*  It's so stupid. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=680.8s)]
*  It's so obvious as to why the funding of this is so haywire and insane for the allegedly [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=681.52s)]
*  fiscally conservative party, fiscally minded. It's a joke. This is all they ever do is spend us [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=690.8s)]
*  into oblivion. And it's for their corporate overlords. And the thing I want the audience [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=699.92s)]
*  to realize too about these guys, these politicians, to a certain extent, you can read this as [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=706.3199999999999s)]
*  some level of bravery on their part. Because their constituents are going to hate this. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=715.92s)]
*  It's going to affect them at the ballot box. They're going to be probably thrown, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=722.3199999999999s)]
*  they're just handing the Democrats the most dysfunctional clown car of a party [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=728.4s)]
*  that we've ever seen. They're just handing them a victory, like Elon Musk, their boy calling social [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=733.1999999999999s)]
*  a Ponzi scheme, cutting Medicaid to give tax cuts to the richest people. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=740.4s)]
*  They're just handing electoral victories and they don't care. But I promise you, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=745.1999999999999s)]
*  you will never see this level of bravery in the other direction. They will never face down [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=751.52s)]
*  their corporate overlords. Us, they'd be like, whatever, who gives a damn? [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=758.0799999999999s)]
*  Whatever. They kick me out of Congress, they kick me out of the Senate. I'll be on somebody's board [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=762.9599999999999s)]
*  someday. I'll sit on some fake think tank or whatever. I'll rake in the money no matter what. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=768.0s)]
*  But they never ever, and we always hear stuff like, well, sacrifices need to be made. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=775.92s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=781.12s)]
*  But there's got to be some belt tightening. And there's got to, never applies to the corporate [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=781.36s)]
*  sector, never applies to the richest people in the country. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=787.04s)]
*  What happens if we organize a movement where people refuse taxation without representation? [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=791.2s)]
*  I mean it. What would happen? [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=798.0s)]
*  Big trouble. They'd have to get the National Guard involved because- [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=800.64s)]
*  What are they gonna do? Marines are gonna bust through my door and murder me for refusing to [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=807.04s)]
*  pay my taxes without representation, by the way, because Congress is useless. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=812.48s)]
*  Congress doesn't represent us. What am I paying my taxes for? Why am I paying taxes so my money can [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=816.56s)]
*  get funneled to a terrorist state, the state of Israel, to carry out atrocities and genocide in [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=822.88s)]
*  Gaza? I want to understand that. Why is it that my money is better suited paying for that trash [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=828.72s)]
*  as opposed to Medicaid for my fellow Americans? [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=834.72s)]
*  Someone explain that to me. Someone needs to explain that to me. How are you gonna on one hand [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=837.84s)]
*  argue, my God, I'm so afraid of the deficit and the debt while shelling out billions of dollars [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=843.4399999999999s)]
*  year after year to Israel? And then also giving massive tax breaks to the rich [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=849.52s)]
*  while nickel and diming Americans were the ones who pay a far greater percentage of their [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=857.6s)]
*  income toward taxes. It's just so gross. It's so gross. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=863.1999999999999s)]
*  So who benefits from this bill? We already know. But let me give you another data point that you [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=868.8s)]
*  can chew on because the Penn Wharton analysis of the House spending bill found that it, of course, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=872.96s)]
*  disproportionately helps wealthier Americans. Households in the first income quintile, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=879.5200000000001s)]
*  I always love an opportunity to say quintile, lose about $940 in 2026, reflecting net reductions in [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=885.44s)]
*  taxes and transfers, including cuts to Medicaid and SNAP. The top 10% of the income distribution [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=894.6400000000001s)]
*  receives about 65% of the total value of the legislation because, of course, they do. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=903.36s)]
*  We're all slaves to our corporate overlords, to the rich. And [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=907.76s)]
*  all this unrest that you're seeing, yes, you can argue that it's about whatever the hot button [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=915.12s)]
*  issue of the day is. But there's a lot of tension in the country because there's a lot of resentment. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=922.0s)]
*  There's a lot of anger. The unrest stems from the unfairness of our political system and our [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=927.6s)]
*  economic system. When people are working more than 40 hours a week and they're unable to pay [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=933.92s)]
*  their rent, mortgage, grocery store prices, yeah, that's gonna lead to a lot of rage in this country. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=939.5999999999999s)]
*  It's just, anyway, freaking, I don't believe for a second that there's a single, [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=948.4s)]
*  well, there might be one, and I think that's Josh Hawley. He's got other issues, but I do think he's [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=956.0799999999999s)]
*  a little more populist economically speaking than pretty much any other Republican. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=961.2800000000001s)]
*  There are no other Republican economic populists. They all pretend they all pay lip service to [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=967.2s)]
*  working class Americans. And then in the dead of night, they'll F you. They'll F you hard. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=974.0s)]
*  They'll do it repeatedly because this is who they are. And Democrats used to be better, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=980.96s)]
*  but they're not much better these days. So here we are. Yeah, you're right, Was. I do think that [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=985.92s)]
*  Republicans are gonna pay a price for this legislation in the midterms, potentially the [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=990.8s)]
*  next presidential election as well. But what's the other alternative? [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=994.64s)]
*  It's not looking great. I tell you that much. The DNC chair is on a freaking Zoom call, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=999.1999999999999s)]
*  trying to quiet quit. It's absolutely so freaking bleak. Their answer is, they said, [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=1008.88s)]
*  rope a dope, play dead. Let Trump and the Republicans ruin our lives. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=1019.68s)]
*  And yeah, we'll just get elected by default for nothing. And so we can get in there [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=1025.76s)]
*  and do nothing again. That's where we're at. Until somebody can Donald Trump that party, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=1033.68s)]
*  meaning single-handedly go in there and change it and make it in their image, [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=1042.72s)]
*  a more progressive image, this is what we're gonna get. The infrastructure [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=1048.32s)]
*  is such that, yeah, the Republicans are beholden to the corporate class, but so are the Democrats. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=1053.76s)]
*  The Republicans got a lot of oil money floating around fossil fuel type of stuff in different [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=1063.84s)]
*  sectors. And it might be a little bit more diversified, but it's still the corporate class. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=1070.2399999999998s)]
*  And these brain dead consultants and the same people, retreads, [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=1076.32s)]
*  they're gonna come up with the same ideas. They want nothing to do with an economic populist [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=1084.16s)]
*  message, sort of moderate on the social stuff because that's, face it, that's where the [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=1090.32s)]
*  median voter is. But most people on both sides are feeling it in the pocketbook. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=1096.08s)]
*  And I think that will be an attractive message, but it's hard to see that coming out of this crew. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=1102.72s)]
*  I have absolutely no hope that change is going to arise from our electoral system or our politicians. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=1109.6000000000001s)]
*  Change comes from the bottom up and it comes from people organizing effectively, [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=1119.04s)]
*  putting their BS in fighting and personal gripes off to the side, finding a way to work together [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=1126.0s)]
*  with like minded individuals on these economic issues and demanding more. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=1133.68s)]
*  Politicians aren't going to do good things out of the kindness of their own hearts. And I don't care [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=1138.56s)]
*  what political party they're coming from. They do good things when they're forced to do good things. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=1143.36s)]
*  But right now, the electorate is not in any way organized. We don't have labor unions the [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=1149.76s)]
*  way we did in the lead up to the New Deal, so that's a problem. And we have holier than thou [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=1156.32s)]
*  people on the left who would never in a million years even consider working with people who agree [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=1162.6399999999999s)]

*  So the real question is what's more important to you, sitting around and waiting for politicians [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=1172.3999999999999s)]

*  finding ways to work and organize with like minded individuals to essentially hold these politicians [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=1182.32s)]
*  feet to the fire and demand more. Because- [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=1187.9199999999998s)]
*  By the way, Ana, just on that point, the revolution isn't gonna happen amongst [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=1190.3999999999999s)]

*  And it's like, all right, DSA. And they do a freaking land acknowledgement to open up the [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=1228.8s)]
*  meeting. It ain't gonna be the DSA types that get this done. And that's not to say, [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1gE_I-l8Q&t=1233.92s)]
