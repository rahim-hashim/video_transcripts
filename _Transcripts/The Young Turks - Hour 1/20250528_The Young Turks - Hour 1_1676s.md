# Congressman Ro Khanna On Repairing A Weak Democratic Party
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [May 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY)
*  This is the party of FDR. We did originally make in America, we industrialized the entire country. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=0.0s)]
*  It's the party that has guaranteed Americans Medicare, Social Security, Medicaid. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=6.24s)]
*  I'm sorry, but the Democratic Party isn't giving off FDR vibes at all. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=11.44s)]
*  All right, back on the Young Turks, Cenk Uygur, and I'm experimenting with you guys. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=15.44s)]
*  Normally we do a bonus episode for the members at eight o'clock Eastern, but these days we're [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=19.52s)]
*  doing a lot more interviews and we got a great one for you guys tonight. Representative Ro Khanna [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=23.2s)]
*  joins us. He's got a proposal in Congress, which is really interesting. It works with some [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=27.04s)]
*  Republicans to put them to the test on whether they really mean what they say. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=33.76s)]
*  So we're gonna get to that in a minute, but first, Representative Khanna, welcome back. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=38.879999999999995s)]
*  Thank you, always great to be on. All right, before we get to the farmer proposal, which [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=42.08s)]
*  I think is really smart and interesting. You were on Fox News recently and created a little bit of [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=48.96s)]
*  a stir, we'd like stirs. So I wanna show the clip a little bit and then talk about it with you. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=54.08s)]
*  Is Rahm Emanuel right here? Has your party become too woke, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=59.44s)]
*  too non masculine and not talking with people about the things that matter? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=65.67999999999999s)]
*  Now he's dead wrong. Look, this is the party of FDR. We did originally make in America, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=70.32s)]
*  we industrialized the entire country. It's the party that has guaranteed Americans Medicare, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=78.24s)]
*  Social Security, Medicaid. I'm calling for new economic patriotism. So we've become a manufacturing [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=83.36s)]
*  superpower. So we have high paying jobs and build wealth in every community and have a Marshall Plan [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=89.28s)]
*  for America. The history of the Democratic Party, it's a great party. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=94.8s)]
*  So Ro, that was great because you took something that isn't going right in the Democratic Party and [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=98.64s)]
*  said, remember what the Democratic Party is actually about and what it's been about historically. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=107.12s)]
*  Then Lawrence Jones pushed back and said, no, no, you guys are all about the woke stuff, etc. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=111.68s)]
*  So how do you get past people, right wingers, mainstream media, constantly bringing up [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=117.28s)]
*  the issues of where Democrats went wrong recently and never actually addressing the core of the party [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=125.36000000000001s)]
*  that the American people used to love? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=133.44s)]
*  Well, they're calling out what did go wrong, NAFTA, China's Ascension to the World Trade [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=135.6s)]
*  Organization, which ironically, Rahm Emanuel was part of. The part of the Democratic Party [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=142.64s)]
*  that was working was FDR, Johnson, Kennedy's call for Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=148.32s)]
*  for building things in America, for having unions and collective bargaining, for having high wages, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=157.84s)]
*  for making sure that we were leading in industries across the nation. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=163.44s)]
*  And I think we need those values but apply to modern times for our party to have a robust [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=167.52s)]
*  economic vision of development in every community, making sure people we actually deliver this time [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=173.44s)]
*  on a living wage, on paid family leave, on childcare, and that we are committed to those [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=178.64s)]
*  priorities. And we call out some of the absurdities I just did this morning in San Francisco, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=185.2s)]
*  had this policy of grading on equity where everyone over 80% got an A and anyone over 40% [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=192.16s)]
*  got a C. I thought it was absurd and so did the San Francisco mayor and the superintendent [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=197.84s)]
*  back trap. So when you see those kind of absurd things, I think we need to call them out. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=202.16s)]
*  Yeah. Sorry to interrupt you. I gotta follow up on that. Thank you for putting that statement out [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=205.6s)]
*  in regard to this whole BS snake oil grading for equity program where the guy behind it is this [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=213.04s)]
*  consultant who charges $10,000 a day to coach teachers on how to pass failing students that [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=220.64s)]
*  shouldn't be passed. Because I do think that those types of acts are associated with the [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=226.88s)]
*  Democratic Party and people are sick of it. And so I hear what you're saying about the history [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=234.32s)]
*  of the Democratic Party. You're right about that. But I don't think the current modern Democratic [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=239.76s)]
*  Party is giving off FDR vibes. You know what I'm saying? Especially when you look at the past [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=245.68s)]
*  administration. Sure, Biden did pass some important bills, but there was a lot of nickel [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=252.96s)]
*  and diming happening. And I remember the decoupling of the physical infrastructure from the social [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=258.88s)]
*  infrastructure, meaning the social safety net in his build back better plan. And what we expected [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=265.36s)]
*  to happen did happen. I should say the physical infrastructure bill passed easily because that's [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=271.6s)]
*  gonna help corporations. But this effort to make our social safety net more robust, in my opinion, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=278.0s)]
*  didn't go nearly far enough. And so when you're talking about negotiating 10 drug prices for [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=285.36s)]
*  Medicare, most of which are about to have their patents run out. I'm sorry, but the Democratic [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=291.04s)]
*  Party isn't giving off FDR vibes at all. There might be a few Democrats who still believe in [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=296.8s)]
*  that mission and that identity, but the whole of the Democratic Party doesn't give off that vibe at [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=302.96000000000004s)]
*  all. Well, I co-chaired Bernie Sanders' campaign and that wing, I believe explicitly takes inspiration [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=308.32s)]
*  from the economic Bill of Rights of FDR. And then we should take inspiration from his vision for [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=315.6s)]
*  production of actually investing in communities and factories and building a workforce. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=321.52s)]
*  So I agree with you, there were missed opportunities with Biden. And we discussed this, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=326.88s)]
*  Cenk and I, and I know with you on the show, I mean, we should have delivered an increase in [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=331.68s)]
*  the minimum wage. I called for firing the parliamentarian then. They said that was crazy. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=336.32s)]
*  Now the Republicans are talking about firing the parliamentarian. That was the biggest miss when [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=340.47999999999996s)]
*  we had the majority in the House, the Senate, the presidency, and we could not increase wages [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=345.35999999999996s)]
*  in this country. We could not get a paid family leave bill passed. We did nothing for child care. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=350.72s)]
*  But there is a group of folks in the party committed to that. And we're also committed [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=356.0s)]
*  to having the highest priority, the economic independence and security of Americans across [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=360.64000000000004s)]
*  this country, both in terms of creation of high jobs and securing education, child care, health [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=366.8s)]
*  care. And I think people will be able to sense that, the urgency, the commitment, the record [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=372.72s)]
*  of fighting for that. And we'll see now if that wing of the party is ascended finally or not. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=378.8s)]
*  Yeah, so you're pushing a populist plank within the House. Yesterday, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=384.0s)]
*  Representative Gil Cisneros signed it, and he's more of a moderate Democrat. So the core economic [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=392.24s)]
*  populist proposals in the Democratic Party are deeply popular. They're popular with American [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=398.15999999999997s)]
*  people. They're popular within the Democratic Party, so that's encouraging. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=403.12s)]
*  But I wanna go back to Rahm Emanuel for one more minute here. Because look, I'm worried about [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=408.0s)]
*  the culture wars and how it went too far. I think the right wing started a lot of them, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=415.68s)]
*  and then some in the left fell into that trap, in my opinion. But to me, the much bigger issue [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=419.52s)]
*  are the economic issues. And that's where the Democratic Party fell even more flat. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=425.84000000000003s)]
*  Because it's people like Rahm Emanuel who said, go corporate and please the donors. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=430.96s)]
*  And while Rahm Emanuel was Chief of Staff and in a lot of ways in charge of the Democratic Party, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=437.35999999999996s)]
*  Chief of Staff for Barack Obama, we lost 1,000 seats nationwide, the Democratic Party did. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=442.71999999999997s)]
*  So Roe, isn't the main problem of the old Democratic Party that we're trying to reform [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=448.24s)]
*  really an economic problem that they're not serving the voters, they're serving the donors? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=455.28s)]
*  Well, it was a problem of economics and globalization. I mean, Rahm Emanuel was [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=461.2s)]
*  proud. He was the architect of NAFTA. I mean, that hollowed out Michigan, it hollowed out Ohio, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=466.0s)]
*  it hollowed out Pennsylvania. It was the beginning of the betrayal of working class voters that Trump [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=471.59999999999997s)]
*  later won. They were the architects of policies to allow China into the World Trade Organization. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=477.67999999999995s)]
*  That created the China shock, according to David Otter, that literally hollowed out towns like [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=483.76s)]
*  Johnstown and Lorraine and Warren, Ohio. So this was the mistake. Now, whether it was a mistake [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=488.72s)]
*  because of corporate greed and corporate funding, I'm sure that's had something to it. Whether it [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=496.24s)]
*  was a mistake in ideology, the point is we've got to say it was a mistake. And then the reality is [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=501.28000000000003s)]
*  we have been unwilling to fight for things like Medicare for All, actually taking on prescription [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=506.64000000000004s)]
*  drug prices because we were too beholden to the influence of big money in American politics. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=513.12s)]
*  We've got to be a party that gets back to centering the working class, centering having [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=519.12s)]
*  industry and economic opportunity in these places that were decimated by globalization. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=525.76s)]
*  And standing up to big corporate interests if they are standing in the way of delivering healthcare, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=530.48s)]
*  education, lower prescription drugs for the American people. Doesn't mean that we have to [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=539.04s)]
*  be anti-business. There can be economic patriots if they want to invest in the United States and [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=543.68s)]
*  if they don't want to engage in lobbying that are hurting things. I mean, I'm not saying that [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=547.92s)]
*  every business person is sort of bad. They're business people who care about the community. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=553.8399999999999s)]
*  But what is bad is people spending millions of dollars to block common sense reforms [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=558.88s)]
*  or those who outsource their jobs. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=563.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=566.0799999999999s)]
*  So you're saying that just taking 20 million and throwing it into like a study group on how to [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=566.56s)]
*  attract men isn't gonna win Democrats elections? That's the most absurd thing I've ever heard. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=572.9599999999999s)]
*  I mean, it reminds me of David Brooks and when I think it was Josh Hawley who went and gave a [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=578.8s)]
*  speech in Missouri on manliness and how the Republicans need to be more manly. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=585.1999999999999s)]
*  And I was having coffee. I don't think Brooks will mind me saying this. He said, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=590.0799999999999s)]
*  He said, you know what, Donald Trump would never go have to give a speech on manliness. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=593.44s)]
*  He just exudes it. Turns out they get, the Democrats don't need a study. We just need to [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=598.0s)]
*  understand that a lot of people lost jobs supporting their families. They lost self-respect. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=603.84s)]
*  We gave all the glory to tech folks in my district and some of them are doing great things and [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=609.76s)]
*  finance folks, but not the people who built the steel and built the industry. They literally were [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=614.0s)]
*  flyover country. We never recognized their contributions. We didn't recognize the challenges [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=618.72s)]
*  that men were facing in terms of their physical safety, in terms of getting a good job and the [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=623.9200000000001s)]
*  pressures of supporting a family, in terms of the concerns with law enforcement and men are [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=629.44s)]
*  incarcerated at a much larger rate. And we kind of made it seem like being a man was easy when [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=636.48s)]
*  men were struggling. And then on top of that, we had this sense that if they said the wrong thing, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=641.76s)]
*  they would be canceled. And there was this curtailment on speech. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=647.2s)]
*  So I don't need a study to say any of that. I just talk to enough people. I mean, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=654.08s)]
*  maybe just talking to people and understanding people is what's needed. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=659.36s)]
*  Yeah, there's nothing less masculine than having to study masculinity to find out what's masculine. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=664.24s)]
*  Okay, anyways, so and look, you're part of Rebellion PAC. Randy Bryce declared in Wisconsin one. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=671.52s)]
*  It's literally an iron work, right? His nickname is Iron Stash. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=680.7199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=684.56s)]
*  Richard Odetta, a veteran in North Carolina Nine. So the populists are back in the Democratic party. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=685.04s)]
*  So now, speaking of which, we go to one of the things in the plank, which is lowering drug prices. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=691.76s)]
*  So, Roe, you think that the Trump administration has kind of given you an opening on [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=696.96s)]
*  pharma. And so tell us about that. Well, why do you think there's an opening and what do you [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=702.32s)]
*  plan to do with other Republicans on the issue of pharma? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=707.6s)]
*  Look, Bernie Sanders and I've been pushing this for five years. We had a bill that said, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=711.76s)]
*  if pharma charges Americans more than the average price that they're charging other [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=715.6s)]
*  industrialized countries, pharma would lose their patents. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=720.32s)]
*  And that this would force pharma not to charge Americans three to four times more than they're [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=723.5999999999999s)]
*  charging people in Germany and Japan and France. Donald Trump comes up with an executive order, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=728.8s)]
*  not as detailed as Bernie Sanders, but basically says Americans shouldn't get charged more than [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=733.52s)]
*  they're paying than people in Europe and other industrialized nations are paying. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=738.48s)]
*  And if they do, he's gonna empower the cabinet secretaries to go after them for price gouging [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=742.24s)]
*  and for antitrust. Now, this is not perfect, but it would get a lot more done in lowering [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=747.28s)]
*  prescription drug prices than anything proposed so far. And the challenge is last time Trump [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=755.04s)]
*  proposed something like this in his first term, it was challenged in the courts by Big Pharma and [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=759.76s)]
*  Block. So I went to the floor and I said, look, I'm not gonna change a word of it because it's [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=763.6s)]
*  70, 80% in the right direction. I'm gonna introduce it as a law to quantify Trump's [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=768.4s)]
*  executive order. It turned out coincidentally, I was one of the first people to codify any [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=774.08s)]
*  Trump executive order, most of them I disagree with. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=778.64s)]
*  And so this became quite a viral hit in MAGA world, they kept playing my speech and we've [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=781.2800000000001s)]
*  gotten two Republicans, Representative Biggs and Representative Luna on it. And to me, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=786.32s)]
*  it's a pretty simple thing about if you're gonna co-sponsor this or not. Are you in the pockets of [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=790.4000000000001s)]
*  Big Pharma and their arguments or are you gonna stand with the American people? There shouldn't [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=795.2800000000001s)]
*  be a single Republican who's not on this bill, it's literally Donald Trump's language. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=799.44s)]
*  And for any Democrat who is sympathetic to going after Big Pharma, let's get on this bill [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=803.36s)]
*  and either get something done or call the Republicans bluff. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=809.36s)]
*  Yeah, look, I love that and I'm gonna ask you a follow up about how people are reacting. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=812.88s)]
*  Because you're basically calling, in my opinion, Trump's bluff. I don't think Trump means it. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=820.0799999999999s)]
*  I think that Trump put out that executive order knowing that it's gonna get blocked by the courts [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=826.3199999999999s)]
*  like it was last time. So that way he gets populist credibility without having to actually [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=830.88s)]
*  hurt his beloved corporate donors. So, okay, but let's say I'm wrong, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=837.12s)]
*  then great, shouldn't every Republican sign on? And since it is something that actually would lower [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=842.24s)]
*  drug prices, that's a progressive and democratic priority that we've always wanted. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=848.16s)]
*  So if Trump is saying, yeah, I'll do Bernie's policy, I'll do Ro Khanna's policy. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=853.04s)]
*  And I think at this point, a lot of people, the internet knows, I'll take yes for an answer, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=858.16s)]
*  right? So then that leads to the second part of the question, shouldn't every Democrat sign on? [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=862.5600000000001s)]
*  So what has been the reaction inside Congress? Do Republicans or Democrats ever even give you [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=868.24s)]
*  a reason for not signing on? Cuz this should be nearly unanimous. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=875.12s)]
*  So we've had some initial interest on Republican and Democratic side, but it should be unanimous. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=878.4s)]
*  We'll see what happens next week after reconciliation. I think the easiest thing [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=885.12s)]
*  in Congress is to just ignore something and that's what a lot of Republicans will do. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=889.68s)]
*  Even if Trump is serious about this, he doesn't have to run for re-election, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=894.48s)]
*  is not withstanding his bantering about third term. And so maybe he's willing to take it on, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=898.88s)]
*  but that doesn't mean that the Republicans in Congress who rely on the big form of money [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=904.0s)]
*  can do that. And so many of them, I think, are just gonna be silent, but we need to pressure them to [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=908.0s)]
*  say, look, this is a moment of truth. On the Democratic side, you have also some [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=913.92s)]
*  Democrats who bought into the pharma arguments. Now they couch it as, this is gonna hurt [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=918.7199999999999s)]
*  pharma innovation. Give me a break. Pharma spends more money on stock buybacks and on dividends [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=923.76s)]
*  than they spend on R&D. And there's plenty of room if they're paying an international price for them [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=928.9599999999999s)]
*  still to have the money on R&D. And by the way, if you wanna subsidize the R&D, we can provide a tax [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=934.4799999999999s)]
*  credit just for the R&D. So there are other ways to get at the R&D. So you'll get some Democrats [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=939.68s)]
*  there. And then some Democrats, they're always the Democrats who let the perfect be the enemy [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=944.3199999999999s)]
*  of the good. They'll say, well, this isn't as good as Bernie's bill. Well, no, it's not as good as [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=950.2399999999999s)]
*  Bernie's bill, but Bernie's not president. So we've gotta deal with at least getting a good bill [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=953.52s)]
*  that may not be perfect. I'm curious if there's been, let's say in a perfect world where [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=958.8s)]
*  the president isn't a liar who's looking for populist credit without actually doing anything. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=966.4s)]
*  And he supports this effort, pushes for it and tries to get this legislation passed. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=972.16s)]
*  Do you get the sense that there might be some Democrats who are upset at the notion of working [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=978.64s)]
*  with the right to pass a bill like this? Yeah, I'm sure there are. There's some who say don't [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=984.4s)]
*  give him any wins, don't give him any political points. But look, there are times where there [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=989.04s)]
*  needs to be vociferous opposition if he's trying to defy court orders, when he's trying to ban [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=996.9599999999999s)]
*  international students from Harvard. Schumer had a total capitulation on the budget without [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1001.12s)]
*  getting any guarantees that Trump would actually spend the money Congress appropriated. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1006.9599999999999s)]
*  That's a time to play hardball. But when he's proposing something that literally is going [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1011.8399999999999s)]
*  to improve Americans' lives, of those times we should work to do that because that's gonna earn [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1016.64s)]
*  us the credibility with people who voted for him, who may be open to voting for us in the next [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1023.6s)]
*  election if we truly get back to populist roots and say that we're in this for improving the lives [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1029.68s)]
*  of ordinary Americans. Yeah, and look, I don't have a question here. I just wanna make a statement. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1034.8799999999999s)]
*  Because the reason why someone like Donald Trump signals this faux populism to his base [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1040.32s)]
*  is because the economic policies that he purports to support are favored by Republican [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1048.8799999999999s)]
*  voters, right? So I say that because this is such a political layup if Democrats [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1057.36s)]
*  weren't corrupted, right? Because it wouldn't be that difficult to get voters to switch over [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1065.2s)]
*  by actually carrying out the economic policies that Trump claims he's in favor of but isn't [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1072.96s)]
*  actually in favor of. If Democrats actually pass those bills and fought for them, not just propose [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1078.72s)]
*  them and pretend to fight for them, but actually fought for them. I think that they could win back [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1085.2800000000002s)]
*  some of the voters who switch sides. But right now, I'm not really seeing a lot of Democrats [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1090.0s)]
*  speak up. They're trying to continue engaging in the culture wars, throw more money at the problems [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1095.68s)]
*  that they have in attracting men or young people. But in reality, I think it's the cultural stuff [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1101.76s)]
*  on top of the fact that voters look at the Democratic Party and ask themselves, [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1110.56s)]
*  okay, but what are they even doing for me? They're not doing anything to improve my situation. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1114.8s)]
*  And on top of that, they're just constantly scolding me over my identity. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1119.44s)]
*  That's not a winning political strategy at all. And so I commend you for being willing to [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1124.16s)]
*  do what you're doing, cuz I'm sure you're getting some backlash from Democratic voters in some cases [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1129.1200000000001s)]
*  and maybe even some Democratic members of Congress. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1134.56s)]
*  I'm getting some, but most people see this as wanting to do something good for the American [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1136.96s)]
*  people. Look, George Will had a column today saying basically, I was wrong on all the issues, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1144.56s)]
*  but I was reasonable, cared about people and at least was honest. And that was preferable to sort [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1151.9199999999998s)]
*  of JD Vance's unconstitutionalism. So I think when you come at it from a sincere place, [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1158.72s)]
*  and if you have a value system that says, I love this country, I wanna make a difference for people, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1165.44s)]
*  and I'm not gonna just look at everything from a strictly partisan lens. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1172.72s)]
*  What ends up happening is you end up building the respect, even if they disagree with you, [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1175.92s)]
*  of people on the other side who can say, okay, you know what? We may not agree with a lot of [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1180.0s)]
*  this stuff, but the person is in a place where he's trying to do things good for the country. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1185.6000000000001s)]
*  And politics is addition. I mean, we can continue to try to speak to our base of a minority base, [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1190.24s)]
*  or we could try to build FDR, Lyndon Johnson-like majorities. I'm in the business of trying to get [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1198.16s)]
*  transformative change. Well, that's not just about giving speeches and it's not just about [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1204.5600000000002s)]
*  rallies, though I love them. It's about building a coalition that can win in every part of this [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1210.3200000000002s)]
*  country. Agree. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1215.76s)]
*  Yeah, I have one more specific question. But to your point, I mean, there's no reason to throw in [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1217.3600000000001s)]
*  unconstitutional actions on top of populism. I don't know why Trump does that. I mean, [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1222.8000000000002s)]
*  I guess he's like authoritarian by nature. But I don't want people to get confused. Populism [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1227.4399999999998s)]
*  has nothing to do with violating the Constitution. So basically, Roe, what you seem to be doing is, [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1234.7199999999998s)]
*  why don't we follow the Constitution and respect it and still do populism? [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1240.4799999999998s)]
*  Which I think is going to be much, much more popular with the American people. And then a [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1244.7199999999998s)]
*  rule on Trump's executive orders is an easy one, which is if he wants us to go to his positions, [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1248.3999999999999s)]
*  the answer is no. But if he comes to our positions, yeah, why not? [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1256.4s)]
*  He came to our positions. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1261.6000000000001s)]
*  That's a good one. Yeah, no, I think a simple way of looking at it and it's clarifying, right? If he [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1263.0400000000002s)]
*  says, look, let's raise the minimum wage, we should say yes. If he says, let's do paid family [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1269.2800000000002s)]
*  leave, we should say yes. And the benefit is, it's a win-win for Democrats. Either we call his bluff [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1273.6000000000001s)]
*  or we participate in doing something that's good for the country so he can't get up in his next [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1279.92s)]
*  state of the union and say, if I propose curing cancer, the Democrats are not gonna applaud. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1285.36s)]
*  I mean, we have to show that we are fundamentally in this for the working class, middle class, [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1289.12s)]
*  for ordinary Americans to improve their lives. And that's a credibility that we have to rebuild. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1295.36s)]
*  We've lost that and we have to rebuild it. Now, I said we have a great party because we have a great [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1299.9199999999998s)]
*  history. It's not just the years of mistakes, but we've got to show that those roots are back, [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1304.9599999999998s)]
*  that that's the party we are. Yeah, so Ro, the last question is specific. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1313.6s)]
*  How do we get a vote on this bill? Cuz I would love to see which Republicans and which Democrats [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1318.32s)]
*  vote no. Because I mean, I'd love to see which Republicans are gonna vote no against [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1324.56s)]
*  Trump's executive order and which Democrats are gonna say, no, I love big pharma and I think we [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1329.4399999999998s)]
*  should have higher drug prices. Well, there are only two ways you can get a vote on this [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1334.08s)]
*  practically. One is if Trump goes all in on it, which so far he hasn't, but he could [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1337.84s)]
*  be that's a test of saying, look, I mean, we know he can get the Republicans to vote for something [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1342.88s)]
*  and he could say, I wanna vote on this. But short of that, what we need to do is get [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1347.6000000000001s)]
*  100 co-sponsors and where there's momentum, where there are 50 Democrats, 50 Republicans saying, [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1352.48s)]
*  look, we believe in this. And then either you get a vote or the absence of co-sponsoring the bill [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1358.96s)]
*  becomes the litmus test itself. That's how we know who's for Medicare for all and who isn't. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1364.72s)]
*  And who isn't. But we should be pushing this because if we can't do this now, [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1369.04s)]
*  we're dreaming if we think suddenly a Democrat president's gonna come and we're gonna get this [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1375.52s)]
*  done. I mean, we've gotta be building for these progressive policies at all times to have any [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1379.6000000000001s)]
*  shot of getting them implemented. And isn't it amazing that when Donald Trump wants to be popular, [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1385.52s)]
*  he goes to progressive policies? Yeah. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1391.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, no, I mean, look, he knows that that's how he won the presidency, right? He explicitly [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1395.1200000000001s)]
*  rejects Mitt Romney, explicitly rejects Paul Ryan. He says, I'm not gonna touch Medicaid, [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1399.76s)]
*  not gonna touch social security. I'm for lowering prescription drug costs. Now, of course, the budget [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1404.0s)]
*  is a total betrayal of all those promises. It does cut Medicaid. It does give tax breaks to the rich. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1410.96s)]
*  It doesn't tax people who are rich. It does nothing for the working class, but that's not [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1417.04s)]
*  how he campaigns. And I think he realizes when he has these budgets that are terrible, [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1422.64s)]
*  trickle down economics that he's gotta throw in some populism. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1428.0800000000002s)]
*  So he puts out these prescription drug type proposals. What we ought to do is that take [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1431.5200000000002s)]
*  those that are actually good and run with them while calling out the parts that are [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1435.92s)]
*  handouts to the ultra wealthy. Yeah, this sounds like an Operation HOPE mission. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1440.24s)]
*  We, at a minimum, we've got to call up and email and tax, etc., all the Democratic congressmen and [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1446.8s)]
*  get them on board with this. Cuz there's, I mean, there's just no reason on God's given [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1455.04s)]
*  earth that a Democrat should be opposed to this bill. So then maybe we'll work on the Republicans, [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1460.08s)]
*  but at least you're trying to do something, Congressman Conner, and you often appear to be [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1464.8799999999999s)]
*  the only one. So we appreciate you coming on. We appreciate you doing sensible things that [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1471.44s)]
*  the great majority of Americans agree with. So every time I've talked about you in other shows, [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1476.96s)]
*  even like you said with George Will Haraldi and other right wingers, left wingers, [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1483.6000000000001s)]
*  middle wingers saying the only sensible man in Congress. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1487.8400000000001s)]
*  So- Well, there's a group of next generation folks, [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1490.96s)]
*  politics at Team Sport, but Jen, you've been great in going out and engaging [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1494.32s)]
*  with the right wing and with Republicans and with others in the country. And [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1501.12s)]
*  and I know you have a similar philosophy, which is that these are popular policies. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1505.2s)]
*  These are things that Trump voters, Democratic voters can agree on in many places. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1510.64s)]
*  And we need to be the party that is pushing these things. Because if we give [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1515.52s)]
*  Republicans a choice of just the same economics, then they often default to people who speak more [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1520.08s)]
*  to their grievance and that has been the Republicans. But if we say, [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1527.36s)]
*  look, we are actually going to deliver these things and have the trust to do it. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1530.8s)]
*  And I think we can win these people back. And the problem is not with the voters. The problem was [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1534.8s)]
*  with us. And that's, I think, the fundamental lesson the Democrats have to learn for the past [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1540.56s)]
*  election. Yeah. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1545.6s)]
*  I mean, the final thing I'll say is, can you coach the Democratic Party? I mean, you just get it. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1547.12s)]
*  So thank you. Thank you for getting it. Thank you for not writing off half of the country of voters [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1553.36s)]
*  because they didn't vote for your preferred candidate. We do have to persuade people. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1559.28s)]
*  Politics is the art of persuasion. And you're willing to speak to people that other Democrats [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1564.24s)]
*  are afraid to speak to in order to accomplish these policies. So I commend you for that. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1570.16s)]
*  And thank you so much for doing it. Well, I appreciate that. And you get it too. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1575.04s)]
*  I don't think there's a rocket science. I just go to these communities and meet folks. I was [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1578.24s)]
*  in Allentown. There were a bunch of Trump voters who were protesting there when my town hall. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1581.28s)]
*  And a few ladies say, hey, Congressman Connick, can you come here? And so I started walking to [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1585.92s)]
*  them. They said, we saw you in Fox News. Can we get a selfie? So I said, sure. And then I invited [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1591.68s)]
*  a few of them into the town hall and they applauded for certain things. They disagreed [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1596.08s)]
*  with other things. But the point is that how many members of Congress are out there just trying to [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1599.36s)]
*  talk to normal people? Obviously, you know a lot of people who voted for Donald Trump. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1604.16s)]
*  He wouldn't be president otherwise. And I just think they don't need me as a coach. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1608.8000000000002s)]
*  They've just got to get out there more. And I think that's my one piece of advice in this year, [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1613.44s)]
*  especially in the off year. Just go listen. Yeah. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1618.72s)]
*  Absolutely. And look, I'll give away part of [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1622.0s)]
*  Rose magic trick here. You know how you get a Republican to agree to pay family leave? [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1625.6000000000001s)]
*  You don't have to do anything. They already agree. 74% of Republican voters agree that we [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1631.3600000000001s)]
*  should have paid family leave. You just need a couple of brave people in Congress to propose it. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1635.76s)]
*  And then the country will actually rally behind these proposals because both Republican [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1641.6000000000001s)]
*  and Democratic voters want it. All right. Well, look, you've seen us fight with Roe. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1646.4s)]
*  You've seen us agree with Roe. And he always comes back and he's always got new ideas. And really, [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1652.4s)]
*  in this case, wonderfully populist and uniting ideas. So we appreciate you, brother. Thanks [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1659.2800000000002s)]
*  for coming on. Thank you, Jay. Thank you, Anna. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1665.3600000000001s)]
*  Thank you. Every time you ring the bell below, [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1668.16s)]
*  an angel gets his wings. Totally not true, but it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH23YzScKRY&t=1670.5600000000002s)]
