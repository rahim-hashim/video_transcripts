"The US has obtained new intelligence suggesting that Israel is making preparations to strike Iranian nuclear facilities, even as the Trump administration has been pursuing a diplomatic deal with Tehran, multiple US officials familiar with the latest intelligence told CNN.

Such a strike would be a brazen break with President Donald Trump, US officials said. It could also risk tipping off a broader regional conflict in the Middle East ‚Äî something the US has sought to avoid since the war in Gaza inflamed tensions beginning in 2023."

# REPORT: Israel Is Preparing To STRIKE Iran
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [May 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0)
*  The question is, is Trump gonna keep allowing Netanyahu to dog walk him? Or is he gonna be [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=0.0s)]
*  a strong leader that avoids wasting American lives and American resources on a war that [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=4.88s)]
*  we shouldn't be fighting? That's the real question here. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=12.96s)]
*  Do you wanna see Israel take action against Iran, even if we don't have a role? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=15.36s)]
*  What I wanna see is Trump give an absolute warning, say within 30 days, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=21.76s)]
*  if Iran doesn't dismantle all of its nuclear programs, enrichment of centrifuges, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=27.44s)]
*  there will be an attack. I would hope Iran would back away and there wouldn't have to be an attack. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=34.0s)]
*  But if there has to be an attack, let Israel do it. Let the United States provide them [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=39.04s)]
*  bunker busting bombs and B-52s. Well, it looks like a war hawk like Alan Dershowitz is in luck [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=43.36s)]
*  because the new intelligence shows that Israel is in fact preparing for a possible strike [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=51.28s)]
*  on Iran's nuclear facilities. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=57.760000000000005s)]
*  Even as the Trump administration pursues diplomatic means to get a new nuclear deal [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=59.68s)]
*  to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons. But as was the case with the nuclear deal that [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=66.08s)]
*  President Barack Obama secured back in 2015, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is not [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  interested in peace here. He wanted to torpedo the original nuclear deal. Unfortunately, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=78.88s)]
*  he succeeded in doing that in Trump's first term. And now as Trump tries to secure a second nuclear [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=85.11999999999999s)]
*  deal, you have Israel thinking maybe we do a strike anyway. And then after we do a strike, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=91.75999999999999s)]
*  what choice does the United States have? Of course, they're gonna help us. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=97.52s)]
*  So let's get into the granular details here. The intel comes from multiple US officials who [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=101.44s)]
*  are familiar with the latest intelligence who caution it's not clear that Israeli leaders [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=106.56s)]
*  have made a final decision. And that in fact, there is deep disagreement within the US government [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=113.2s)]
*  about the likelihood that Israel will ultimately act. Whether and how Israel strikes will likely [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=119.60000000000001s)]
*  depend on what it thinks of the US negotiations with Tehran over its nuclear program. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=125.76s)]
*  So there are multiple people who spoke to CNN for this story. And another person that's familiar [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=132.88s)]
*  with this intelligence that's been gathered by US officials on this issue says that the chance of [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=139.51999999999998s)]
*  an Israeli strike on an Iranian nuclear facility has gone up significantly in recent months. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=144.88s)]
*  And the prospect of a Trump negotiated US Iran deal that doesn't remove all of Iran's uranium [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=151.11999999999998s)]
*  makes the chance of a strike more likely. So let's just talk about that briefly because it's [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=159.04000000000002s)]
*  important to understand how these negotiations are going. Now, the United States and Iran [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=165.20000000000002s)]
*  concluded their fourth round of negotiations over the weekend. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=170.56s)]
*  They're going to continue talking. So this pursuit of diplomacy, which we should [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=175.28s)]
*  give Trump some positive reinforcement for, continues and that's a good thing. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=181.12s)]
*  But right now the real sticking point is the fact that the United States doesn't want Iran to enrich [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=186.0s)]
*  any uranium at all, which is a problem. Because Iran, especially under the original nuclear deal, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=192.88s)]
*  was able to enrich some uranium for their energy needs. Now think about how things operate in Iran. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=199.51999999999998s)]
*  Yes, it is an oil producing country, but oil is really the heart of their economy. They export [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=206.32s)]
*  their oil in order to keep their economy going. And they want to enrich uranium, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=213.84s)]
*  have the minimal amount necessary to generate enough energy for their country. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=219.6s)]
*  So it's not enough enriched uranium to build a nuclear weapon, but it is enough for them to [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=226.88s)]
*  provide energy to the people of Iran. And so that's the sticking point. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=234.07999999999998s)]
*  The Trump administration is like, no, no, no uranium at all, no enriched uranium at all. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=238.08s)]
*  And Iran's like, bro, we need energy. So that's what they're negotiating right now. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=244.08s)]
*  Now, according to CNN, the heightened concerns about a strike come not only from the public and [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=248.88000000000002s)]
*  private messaging from senior Israeli officials, but also from intercepted Israeli communications [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=254.72000000000003s)]
*  and observations of Israeli military movements that could suggest that there will be an imminent [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=261.84000000000003s)]
*  strike. For example, Israel has reportedly moved some of their air munitions and has completed [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=267.68s)]
*  some military exercises and air exercise to be specific. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=274.56s)]
*  Thus far, Trump has stuck to the policy of diplomacy. And guys, regardless of what you [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=279.04s)]
*  think about Trump, he should be given kudos for that because the positive reinforcement might [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=283.92s)]
*  work, right? If he does something that we want, that we think is a good thing, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=289.84000000000003s)]
*  cheering him on might encourage him to keep going in that direction. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=295.84000000000003s)]
*  But we'll see, we'll see because Trump is easily swayed. He's very impressionable. He can turn on [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=300.48s)]
*  anyone at any given moment. So far, he has resisted a war with Iran, but let's not forget. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=306.32s)]
*  He is the one who ripped up the Iran nuclear deal in his first term. Trump is also the guy [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=312.0s)]
*  who decided to assassinate Qasem Soleimani, who was the top general in Iran's military. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=316.48s)]
*  And that could have led to, I mean, a full-fledged war, a hot war between the United States and Iran [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=322.56s)]
*  at the time. Luckily, it didn't, but Trump was definitely playing with fire in his first term. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=328.08000000000004s)]
*  Going to war with Iran would be disastrous, and thousands of American soldiers would die if [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=333.92s)]
*  it gets to a point where we have boots on the ground. We must avoid war with Iran, especially [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=340.32s)]
*  considering the fact that we'd be getting dragged into a war with Iran by a foreign [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=346.64000000000004s)]
*  government. That would be insane. But let me give you some more details here. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=351.68s)]
*  Now, Trump has also publicly threatened military action against Iran if his administration's [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=355.36s)]
*  efforts to broker a new nuclear deal fail. So I'm really concerned about that. Now, negotiations [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=362.16s)]
*  are ongoing. They have stalled recently because of that conflict in regard to enriched uranium. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=369.28000000000003s)]
*  Iran's leader has called the United States demand for Iran to not enrich uranium, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=376.16s)]
*  a big mistake. Now, Trump's reluctance thus far to greenlight an attack against Iran may be the [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=384.24s)]
*  only thing causing Israel to hesitate. Netanyahu wants to shut down any possible nuclear deal [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=390.40000000000003s)]
*  between the United States and Iran, but we shouldn't be surprised by that. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=398.8s)]
*  I mean, he was railing against the original deal from the very beginning, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=402.48s)]
*  but he also doesn't want to alienate Donald Trump. He sees the American government as his puppet. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=406.72s)]
*  He sees Trump as his dog that he takes for a walk now and then. The question is, is Trump gonna keep [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=412.96000000000004s)]
*  allowing Netanyahu to dog walk him? Or is he gonna be a strong leader that avoids wasting American [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=418.48s)]
*  lives and American resources on a war that we shouldn't be fighting? That's the real question [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=426.24s)]
*  here. Jonathan Panikov, who's a former senior intelligence official specializing in the region, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=431.92s)]
*  says the following. At the end of the day, the Israeli decision making is going to be predicated [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=437.44s)]
*  on US policy determinations and actions and what agreements President Trump does or does not come [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=442.56s)]
*  with Iran. And according to CNN, Panikov added that he did not believe that Netanyahu would be [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=449.6s)]
*  willing to risk entirely fracturing the US relationship he has by launching a strike without [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=456.32s)]
*  at least tacit approval. I think he's giving Netanyahu way too much credit. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=463.36s)]
*  I don't think that's the case. I think Netanyahu is willing to do whatever it takes to get what [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=470.8s)]
*  he wants. I don't think he cares about any relationships. So I would not rely on [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=475.12s)]
*  Netanyahu wanting to remain buddies with Trump as the only way to prevent this war from happening. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=482.24s)]
*  I think Trump needs to show that he is a strong leader who is not going to back Israel up if they [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=487.20000000000005s)]
*  try to drag us into a hot war with Iran. Now, one anonymous source argued that I think it's more [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=494.24s)]
*  likely they strike to try to get the deal to fall apart if they think Trump is going to settle for [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=500.08000000000004s)]
*  a bad deal. By the way, Netanyahu thinks any diplomatic deal is a bad deal. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=506.56s)]
*  But this anonymous source, who I wish would come out publicly with his name or her name, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=511.12s)]
*  is right. I mean, I'm more inclined to believe this prediction or this analysis as it pertains [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=517.28s)]
*  to Benjamin Netanyahu and what is likely to happen. The Israelis have not been shy about [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=523.76s)]
*  signaling that to us, both publicly and privately, totally correct about that. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=529.6800000000001s)]
*  It has consistently been the Israeli position that the military option is the only option [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=535.12s)]
*  to stopping Iran's military nuclear program, one US official noted. And look, if Netanyahu [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=542.3199999999999s)]
*  does move ahead with a strike, it looks like the US may fall in line anyway, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=549.04s)]
*  and that's what I'm worried about. And you think Netanyahu doesn't know that? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=553.76s)]
*  You think Bibi doesn't know that? You think the Israeli government doesn't know [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=556.64s)]
*  that the US government will effectively be pressured into following along, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=561.44s)]
*  into providing the resources, the bombs, essentially whatever Israel needs to continue [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=566.24s)]
*  fighting Iran. It's just, and look, according to one official, the US has stepped up intelligence [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=572.88s)]
*  gathering to be ready to aid Israel if its leaders decide to strike. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=581.52s)]
*  So in other words, Israel might force Trump's hand. I mean, I don't necessarily think it needs [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=587.92s)]
*  to play out that way. If they decide to launch strikes in Iran, I think it's totally fine. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=599.12s)]
*  And in fact, the sign of a good leader to say, you're trying to drag us into a war with Iran. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=607.68s)]
*  When I said I wanted to pursue diplomatic means, all right, go fend for yourselves. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=614.0s)]
*  That's what a strong leader would do. Now, would Trump actually do that? It depends who signed his [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=619.12s)]
*  last check. But let me continue. Another source close to the Trump administration says the US is [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=622.72s)]
*  unlikely to help. So you have sources saying two different things, okay? So another source says, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=629.28s)]
*  no, no, no, the US is unlikely to help Israel carry out strikes on Iranian nuclear sites at [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=634.48s)]
*  this moment, short of some major provocation by Tehran. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=639.2s)]
*  So there are some Democrats, by the way. I wanna focus on them just for a second, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=644.24s)]
*  because they're more concerned about the fact that this information leaked to the press. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=648.8000000000001s)]
*  They're less concerned about the United States getting dragged into a war with Iran. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=654.6400000000001s)]
*  And that individual is Democratic lawmaker Jared Moskowitz. Let's take a look. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=659.2800000000001s)]
*  There was just a leak that is now national news that Israel is poised to strike Iran. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=663.28s)]
*  Where did that leak come from in the administration? Do we know what department leaked that? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=672.48s)]
*  Is that being looked into? [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=676.48s)]
*  Well, I'm not aware of the leak that you're discussing. I'm obviously, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=677.36s)]
*  I wouldn't discuss intelligence matters and even verify whether it's even true. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=680.9599999999999s)]
*  I also don't think it's a mystery though. Irrespective, I'm not talking about the leak, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=684.64s)]
*  I'm not talking about the news story that Israel has made clear that they retain the option of [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=688.24s)]
*  action to limit Iran from ever gaining a nuclear capability. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=694.32s)]
*  Listen, that's fair. Israel's free to do what it pleases. Israel's a foreign government. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=697.6800000000001s)]
*  I'm not interested in influencing Israel. I'm not interested in our government dictating what [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=703.92s)]
*  the Israeli people do. I see Israel and the United States as two separate countries. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=709.6800000000001s)]
*  So if Israel wants to go to war, go right ahead, go to war. The real question here, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=714.32s)]
*  Rubio, is whether or not the American people are going to fight and fund that war on behalf of [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=718.96s)]
*  Israel as they did with Iraq in 2003. And some people get real touchy when that's mentioned, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=725.92s)]
*  right? Because we're all supposed to believe that we did a preemptive war in Iraq in 2003 [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=732.16s)]
*  in response to 9-11. No, no, Saddam Hussein and Iraq had nothing to do with 9-11. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=739.0400000000001s)]
*  Was it for oil? No, actually, maybe that was a little bit of a factor, but no, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=746.0s)]
*  that wasn't the main reason. It really wasn't. Why did we go to war with Iraq? [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=750.4000000000001s)]
*  Let me take you back 22 years ago when all these pieces were being published [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=755.6800000000001s)]
*  right before we went to war with Iraq. Now, if you're paying close attention, these stories [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=761.5200000000001s)]
*  weren't widespread. But if you're paying close attention, if you're addicted to politics, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=767.12s)]
*  you saw the pressure coming from Israel to invade Iraq. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=772.32s)]
*  And it's just incredible to go back and read these pieces. Now I'm gonna go to [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=778.24s)]
*  this piece that was written in February 27th, 2003. So weeks before we invaded [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=782.32s)]
*  Iraq with a preemptive strike, it's titled threats and responses, the Middle East. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=790.88s)]
*  Israel says war on Iraq would benefit the region. They really wanted that regime change in Iraq. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=797.68s)]
*  That's interesting. With the Oslo agreement in tatters, the Israelis are now putting hopes [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=804.72s)]
*  in an American war on Iraq. Fascinating. Israel signaled its decision to put public pressure [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=810.96s)]
*  on President George Bush to go ahead with a military attack on Iraq, even though it [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=817.6800000000001s)]
*  believes Saddam Hussein may well retaliate by striking Israel. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=824.4000000000001s)]
*  What's funny about that is that was what Israel was saying to the United States. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=828.8000000000001s)]
*  Like, it really puts us at risk. They might strike us considering the proximity. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=833.5200000000001s)]
*  It could be dangerous. But there was other reporting showing that the Israeli intelligence [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=841.6800000000001s)]
*  agency, Mossad, did not feel that Iraq was actually going to strike them. That they didn't [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=848.72s)]
*  even have the capability to strike them if the United States decided to go to war with Iraq. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=854.0s)]
*  And as we all know, our soldiers did have their boots on the ground in that country. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=859.76s)]
*  More than 4,000 of them died fighting that useless war. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=866.08s)]
*  In August of 2002, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's aide, Ranan Gishin, argued that US officials [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=873.2s)]
*  not delay a military strike in Iraq, arguing that any postponement of an attack on Iraq at [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=881.0400000000001s)]
*  this stage will serve no purpose. It will only give him, Saddam Hussein, more of an opportunity [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=887.2s)]
*  to accelerate his program of weapons of mass destruction. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=893.68s)]
*  Yeah, Iraq didn't have weapons of mass destruction. By the way, at the time, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=899.4399999999999s)]
*  Israeli intelligence shared with the United States that they believe that Iraq had [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=903.92s)]
*  chemical weapons, that they had bio weapons. And that wasn't the case either. Interesting, okay. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=908.3199999999999s)]
*  And how can we forget, Benjamin Netanyahu himself [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=916.7199999999999s)]
*  even came to the United States in 2002 to pressure the United States to invade Iraq [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=920.48s)]
*  in a preemptive war? [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=926.56s)]
*  If you take out Saddam, Saddam's regime, I guarantee you that it will have enormous [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=927.52s)]
*  positive reverberations on the region. And I think that people sitting right next door [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=936.56s)]
*  in Iran, young people and many others will say the time of such regimes of such just bots is gone. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=941.76s)]
*  There is a new age, something new is happening. The way to deal with [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=949.2s)]
*  terrorist regimes, well, with terror was to deal with the terrorist regimes. And the way to deal [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=953.44s)]
*  with the terrorist regimes, among other things, was to apply military force against them. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=958.24s)]
*  The application of power is the most important thing in winning the war on terrorism. If I had [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=962.88s)]
*  to say, what are the three principles of winning the war on terror? It's like, what are the three [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=967.6800000000001s)]
*  principles of real estate, the three L's, location, location, location? The three principles of winning [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=971.9200000000001s)]
*  the war on terror are the three W's, winning, winning and winning. The more victories you amass, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=976.72s)]
*  the easier the next victory becomes. The first victory in Afghanistan makes the second victory [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=982.88s)]
*  in Iraq that much easier. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=987.44s)]
*  Was there a victor in Iraq? By the way, what's hilarious about this, and it's not hilarious at [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=989.36s)]
*  all, it's actually devastating, is the fact that while Israel was pressuring the United States at [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=996.72s)]
*  the time to invade Iraq, once the US made that decision, you think Israel was allied with us [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=1001.2s)]
*  and joined in on that war? No, no, no, they didn't. They're like, go, yes, risk the lives [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=1008.5600000000001s)]
*  of the men and women in your military to fight our war for regime change in Iraq. Have fun. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=1016.96s)]
*  It's just so utterly disgusting. So look, I give you that history [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=1024.72s)]
*  because the United States cannot be tricked into fighting another Middle Eastern war on behalf of [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=1027.84s)]
*  a foreign country. I'm done with it. Everyone in this country should be done with it. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=1035.28s)]
*  The anti-war rhetoric that was uttered by Donald Trump during the election cycle [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=1042.3999999999999s)]
*  was appealing to people because of the fact that they do not want to continue [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=1050.24s)]
*  in these interventionist nonsense wars that just use up our resources and do nothing for [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=1056.48s)]
*  the American people. So Trump loves to talk about what a disaster Iraq was. He should keep that in [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=1062.96s)]
*  mind as he's being goaded into war with Iran. What does he want his legacy to be? Does he want it to [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=1068.8s)]
*  be more bloodshed? Does he want it to be more war? And does he want to get dog walked by a foreign [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=1074.96s)]
*  country? [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CY2IjVD2M0&t=1081.2s)]
