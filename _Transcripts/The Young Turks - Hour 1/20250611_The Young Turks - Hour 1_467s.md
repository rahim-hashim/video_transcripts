# BREAKING: Judge Rules Trump Can't Hold Mahmoud Khalil
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0)
*  Mahmoud Khalil has been detained, who has been detained by the Trump administration for over [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=0.0s)]
*  three months now, is getting a little bit of relief from the federal courts. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=6.24s)]
*  Because today a federal judge overseeing his case ruled that the government cannot detain [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=12.32s)]
*  or deport Khalil for one specific reason. So let's explain the caveats at play here, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=18.32s)]
*  okay? But before we do, for anyone who missed this story, Khalil was a Columbia University [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=24.88s)]
*  student. He was a green card holder, so a legal resident of the United States. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=30.96s)]
*  He had no criminal record whatsoever. He was not here illegally. And there is no evidence that he [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=36.239999999999995s)]
*  is a terrorist sympathizer. He did make the grave error of taking part in pro-peace, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=42.96s)]
*  pro-Palestinian demonstrations on Columbia's campus. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=51.36s)]
*  Yes, I understand that some of those protesters did behave in [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=54.88s)]
*  ways that they could face charges for. He wasn't one of them. At least there hasn't been any [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=59.84s)]
*  evidence presented indicating that he was one of them. So with that in mind, you have the Trump [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=64.96s)]
*  administration that detains him and gets ready to deport him with the argument that under the Alien [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=71.12s)]
*  Enemies Act, and because he's allegedly a terrorist sympathizer, the Secretary of State Marco [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=80.08s)]
*  Rubio can just deport him. Luckily Khalil challenged this in the courts and then that brings us to [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=87.2s)]
*  today. So for one, the decision that was made by the federal judge does not take effect until [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=93.2s)]
*  Friday morning, which gives the US government time to appeal the decision. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=100.24s)]
*  And also keep in mind that the government has argued that Khalil's presence in the United States [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=104.8s)]
*  poses a threat to the country's foreign policy goal of preventing anti-Semitism. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=109.6s)]
*  There's no goal of our government to prevent racism. Sure, you'll have the government, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=116.08s)]
*  meaning Congress, passing anti-discrimination laws and stuff like that. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  But to have the executive branch unilaterally act like this [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=132.0s)]
*  at the behest of the Israeli government, let's just keep it real, that's what this [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=136.4s)]
*  is about, is pretty freaking gross. And that's what frustrates me about this story, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=139.36s)]
*  that good people exercising their free speech who haven't done anything wrong, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=143.84s)]
*  there isn't any evidence of them being terrorist sympathizers, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=148.72000000000003s)]
*  they're being targeted at the behest of a foreign government for deportation. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=151.60000000000002s)]
*  Hey Israel, what are you gonna do about me? You're gonna deport me? It's just so pathetic. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=156.8s)]
*  The more they try to silence their critics, the more counterproductive their cause is. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=162.24s)]
*  It really is. I mean, the more negative attention is directed toward Israel and the crimes that [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=168.16s)]
*  they're committing in Gaza and the West Bank. Anyway, a spokesperson for the Department of [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=173.76s)]
*  Homeland Security has alleged that Khalil has acted to glorify and support terrorists. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=177.92s)]
*  That's the big claim. Khalil has yet to be accused of a specific crime. He doesn't have [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=183.44s)]
*  a criminal history and there's no evidence that he supports terrorists. Secretary Seymour Correvio [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=188.56s)]
*  has argued that a provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 allows him to [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=194.08s)]
*  personally unilaterally determine whether or not Khalil should be able to remain in the United [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=199.92000000000002s)]
*  States. However, the federal judge overseeing Khalil's case ruled that Khalil can no longer [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=206.16000000000003s)]
*  be detained based on the foreign policy argument that the Trump administration has provided. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=213.68s)]
*  So the judge is like, no, this is not justification for his detainment and it's not [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=221.68s)]
*  justification for him being deported. However, New Jersey District Court Judge Michael [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=228.08s)]
*  Farbrias said his findings have no impact on efforts to remove Khalil for reasons other than [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=234.56s)]
*  the Secretary of State's determination. So if the Trump administration finds some [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=242.08s)]
*  other justification to deport Khalil, they might be able to do so. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=246.96s)]
*  But the reason that they've given so far makes no sense. And luckily, the judge realized that it [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=252.08s)]
*  makes no sense and cannot be used as justification to deport Khalil. That means the Trump [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=258.96000000000004s)]
*  administration again could attempt to keep Khalil in detention for other reasons. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=263.44s)]
*  And I'm sure they're gonna try. We'll see. The Department of Homeland Security, DHS, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=268.8s)]
*  has said that Khalil failed to accurately complete his application for the green card [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=273.12s)]
*  and that this could be a reason for permanent resident status being revoked. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=278.56s)]
*  The judge said that may lead to Khalil being detained again, but that this was unlikely as [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=284.88s)]
*  lawful permanent residents were, I'm sorry, but that this was unlikely as lawful permanent residents [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=291.84000000000003s)]
*  were virtually never detained pending removal for something as small as a form error. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=300.8s)]
*  And that strongly suggests that this is the Secretary of State's determination that drives [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=307.84000000000003s)]
*  the petitioner's ongoing detention, not the other charge against him the judge wrote. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=313.76s)]
*  So in other words, the other ridiculous claim about him not filling out his green card form [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=320.24s)]
*  perfectly or completely is not the claim that Marco Rubio really presented front and center [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=328.0s)]
*  because it's a ridiculous claim number one. But his justification for targeting Khalil also [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=334.72s)]
*  doesn't make any sense because there's no evidence to it, none at all. We would have seen it by now. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=341.04s)]
*  Geez, now the Trump administration has also accused Khalil of willingly failing to disclose [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=347.04s)]
*  his membership in several organizations when he applied for permanent residency. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=352.56s)]
*  Allegations that Khalil's lawyers have contested fearly. Finally, the judge wrote that it was [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=357.12s)]
*  overwhelmingly likely that Khalil would not be detained based solely on those allegations. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=362.88s)]
*  But it is not clear if he would be released on Friday if the government were to argue that those [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=368.64s)]
*  allegations were in fact the reason for his detention. So this disastrous terrible story, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=374.64s)]
*  this saga isn't over yet. We're gonna wait and see what happens on Friday. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=381.68s)]
*  While in detention, Khalil has missed the birth of his firstborn child. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=385.84s)]
*  And time will tell how the Trump administration responds to the judges ruling here. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=392.96s)]
*  I think it would be best for them to just free Khalil and not be dog walked [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=396.71999999999997s)]
*  by a foreign government because it's embarrassing. It just is. It makes me sick to my stomach [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=403.28s)]
*  that innocent people are being targeted on US soil at the behest of Israel. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=410.79999999999995s)]
*  Your feelings are hurt because people are drawing attention to the atrocities you're committing in [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=416.0s)]
*  Gaza. You think that the critics are gonna stop because you're targeting people? No, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=419.76s)]
*  it's just gonna make our voices grow louder. And that's what's gonna happen moving forward. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=426.0s)]
*  You're not gonna be able to silence people. We're not living in the era of four news networks that [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=431.2s)]
*  gatekeep everything. We see what's happening on the ground. We see the videos. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=437.28s)]
*  We hear the testimony from American doctors who risk their lives to provide aid in Gaza and then [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=442.0s)]
*  come back to the United States and explain what they saw with their own two eyes. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=448.08s)]
*  We know what's happening. So targeting Khalil only draws more attention to Israel's atrocities. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=451.44s)]
*  But they're too stupid to realize that. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX1Nc7wyC0&t=458.4s)]
