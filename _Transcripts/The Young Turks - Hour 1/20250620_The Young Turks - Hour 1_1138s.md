"President Trump‚Äôs sudden announcement that he could take up to two weeks to decide whether to plunge the United States into the heart of the Israel-Iran conflict is being advertised by the White House as giving diplomacy one more chance to work. 
But it also opens a host of new military and covert options."

# Trump Gives MAJOR Update On Plans For Iran Attack
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4)
*  Regarding the ongoing situation in Iran, I know there has been a lot of speculation amongst [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=0.0s)]
*  all of you in the media regarding the president's decision making and whether or not the United [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=4.8s)]
*  States will be directly involved. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=9.28s)]
*  In light of that news, I have a message directly from the president, and I quote, based on [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=11.44s)]
*  the fact that there's a substantial chance of negotiations that may or may not take place [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=16.6s)]
*  with Iran in the near future. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=21.48s)]
*  I will make my decision whether or not to go within the next two weeks. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=23.52s)]
*  It was strange, admittedly, to get updates about the possibility of war from the press [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=28.48s)]
*  secretary rather than from truth social, but we'll go with it. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=33.44s)]
*  So it could be two weeks. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=37.16s)]
*  But is that actually him looking for diplomacy? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=40.0s)]
*  Is that him buying a little bit of time to set up our attack? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=44.08s)]
*  Cenk, what do you make of that? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=47.88s)]
*  Yeah, I'm so curious what you guys think about it, because I think he's trying to, he's basically [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  saying, all right, MAGA and neocons, you guys fight, and then whoever wins and is more popular, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=56.96s)]
*  I'll go on your side. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=62.8s)]
*  That's my read of Trump and why he's doing this two weeks. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=64.28s)]
*  Plus, he wants to get Iran back to the negotiating table so that he could declare that, you see [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=67.36s)]
*  that I was a tough guy, and then I got peace. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=72.76s)]
*  That'd be perfect for Trump's brand, right? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=75.76s)]
*  Both tough and anti-war. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=80.52s)]
*  So he's trying to thread that needle. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=82.58s)]
*  Whether that'll work is an entirely different question. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=85.82s)]
*  Which side is he finally going to end up on? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=88.74s)]
*  Different question. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=91.66s)]
*  How is MAGA going to react? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=92.66s)]
*  Different question, and those are all the questions we've got to tackle. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=94.34s)]
*  Yeah, at the end of the day, look, if we do not directly enter into the war, then on that, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=96.82s)]
*  he gets, I guess, a little bit of anti-war, although that's just maintaining a status [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=101.98s)]
*  quo of Biden and go in. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=106.7s)]
*  But he also said that, with me as president, we have stability. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=108.82s)]
*  People don't do attacks like Russia did with Ukraine and with Hamas and everything, except [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=112.46s)]
*  it's not the case. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=116.41999999999999s)]
*  Israel felt totally free to attack whoever they want. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=117.94s)]
*  This isn't even the first place since he became president. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=121.17999999999999s)]
*  So he does have to answer for that. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=124.46s)]
*  Yeah, I just got a gentleman real quick on that. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=126.38s)]
*  Guys, it's even worse than that, right? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=128.57999999999998s)]
*  Because he always says, that war would have never started if I was president. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=130.5s)]
*  Would have never started, right? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=134.66s)]
*  But in this case, not only did it start under Trump, but Netanyahu defied Trump in starting [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=136.26s)]
*  the war. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=142.73999999999998s)]
*  He said, I don't care what you think. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=143.73999999999998s)]
*  I don't work for you, you work for me. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=144.73999999999998s)]
*  And I'm going to start this war, and then you're going to have to think through for [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=147.01999999999998s)]
*  two weeks if you're my bitch or not. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=150.2s)]
*  And so that's a decision Trump's trying to make. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=152.5s)]
*  So don't tell me that war's wouldn't have started under you when a giant one just started [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=154.57999999999998s)]
*  and you're thinking of joining it. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=158.45999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=160.06s)]
*  But let's try to work through some of the insider information to figure out how likely [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=161.06s)]
*  it is that we will actually get ourselves involved in this war. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=165.7s)]
*  Because there's evidence that points in both directions, and I'm not 100% certain I know [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=168.78s)]
*  exactly what he's thinking. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=173.7s)]
*  I'm not certain that he knows exactly what he's thinking. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=175.26s)]
*  But anyway, some are saying in the administration that the two week timeline is that he is very [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=178.57999999999998s)]
*  worried, seriously worried about the lasting impacts of regime change, which would be nice. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=185.82s)]
*  It's good to see a president actually thinking through what happens after a regime is toppled [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=191.78s)]
*  He apparently doesn't want to turn Iran into Libya, said one insider familiar with the [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=196.29999999999998s)]
*  deliberations that are going on. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=200.94s)]
*  He apparently in recent days has specifically mentioned Libya's decade long plunge into [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=203.22s)]
*  anarchy in 2011 after the US joined a NATO bombing campaign to oust Gaddafi. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=207.01999999999998s)]
*  That's according to three different sources. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=212.22s)]
*  But and this is where it's much more typical Trump administration stuff. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=214.9s)]
*  They do believe that if we engage in war and the regime is toppled and stuff like that [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=219.14s)]
*  In other words, it isn't actually his fault anyway. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=223.54s)]
*  The insider said Libya was a much more extended kind of bombing commitment and it ended up [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=226.3s)]
*  being regime change. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=231.22s)]
*  If the regime falls in Iran, then it's not on Trump, because that's not the goal of his [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=232.74s)]
*  very limited strike. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=236.66s)]
*  I would love to have an actual man in charge if we're gonna have something that looks like [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=238.82s)]
*  a man, somebody who takes responsibility for what they do. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=243.54s)]
*  Your goal has no, it doesn't matter. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=246.34s)]
*  If you strike them, if you for instance, as they're now talking about potentially do assassinate [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=250.54s)]
*  the leader, and it does fall into a civil war, massive infighting, failed state or whatever. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=254.44s)]
*  It is very small comfort to say, but that wasn't my goal, it was limited striking. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=261.7s)]
*  It was just a decapitation attack. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=266.65999999999997s)]
*  And so no, they're not gonna take responsibility if that ends up happening. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=269.26s)]
*  But I do like hearing that at least it's something they're thinking about. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=273.02s)]
*  And so some people are saying that it isn't actually about buying time for diplomacy. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=277.22s)]
*  And it could be Trump is still saying you want some kind of deal, although right before [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=283.98s)]
*  we went live, he said that Europe, I guess, isn't allowed to talk to Iran. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=286.94000000000005s)]
*  And Iran doesn't wanna talk to them anyway. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=291.28000000000003s)]
*  But others are saying that it's just to buy time to set up for the actual attack. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=294.06s)]
*  Apparently, it would provide time for a second American aircraft carrier to get into place. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=297.58000000000004s)]
*  So that if we do the attack and we need to defend against the counterattack, we would [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=303.48s)]
*  have more material in the area to do that. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=307.36s)]
*  It would also provide Israel more time to destroy the air defenses around the site that [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=310.24s)]
*  we would be attacking with our bunker busters. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=314.58000000000004s)]
*  And so there really is evidence to support both conclusions, that this is serious or [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=318.0s)]
*  that it's not. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=323.04s)]
*  I mean, the third sort of related topic to the last one is, it's two weeks to get Iran [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=324.04s)]
*  to put down their defenses a little bit. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=329.16s)]
*  Maybe you wake up tomorrow in the middle of the night, we launch the attack. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=332.32000000000005s)]
*  I mean, he's definitely not above lying. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=335.36s)]
*  No for sure. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=339.16s)]
*  And look guys, there's a good argument to be made that it's to prepare. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=340.16s)]
*  And I was gonna say the same thing as John, it could be just to do a surprise attack. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=343.44s)]
*  We're gonna come in two weeks. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=347.48s)]
*  Just like Israel did a surprise attack on them in the middle of our so called peace [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=349.20000000000005s)]
*  negotiations, right? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=353.28000000000003s)]
*  So it's not like they didn't just do this like a minute ago. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=354.82000000000005s)]
*  Having said that, I don't think that's what it is. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=358.52000000000004s)]
*  Why? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=361.04s)]
*  Because Israeli officials are mad at the delay. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=362.04s)]
*  They're like, we already gave you an order, and now you're gonna take two weeks to do [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=365.32s)]
*  our order? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=370.24s)]
*  How dare you? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=371.8s)]
*  So when I see quotes like that, and obviously I'm paraphrasing, okay, in the press with [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=373.40000000000003s)]
*  Israeli officials upset at the American government for delaying. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=378.48s)]
*  Then I think, okay, no, he is actually delaying. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=383.12s)]
*  Unless it's like an enormously elaborate surprise attack and they've coordinated the Israeli [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=386.48s)]
*  officials pretending to be upset. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=392.04s)]
*  But I tend to doubt that. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=394.44s)]
*  Trey, what do you think? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=395.44s)]
*  Well, I think we can all agree, generally as Americans, we can rest easy in the comfort [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=396.44s)]
*  of knowing that whatever decision Donald Trump ultimately makes, it's sure to be the most [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=400.92s)]
*  level headed and diplomatic option available to him. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=406.52s)]
*  Not obviously terrified of the exact opposite. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=409.76s)]
*  He probably is trying to have it both ways. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=415.36s)]
*  Maybe there's something too, like you said, Cenk, about having them fight it out, kind [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=416.8s)]
*  of give it a minute, see which side comes out on top. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=420.96000000000004s)]
*  But I'm, in spite of what I said a minute ago, very confident that whatever he ends [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=423.76s)]
*  up doing, it's not gonna be great. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=427.28000000000003s)]
*  And as far, at least, like John mentioned, at least they even somewhat acknowledge that [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=429.36s)]
*  regime change is sometimes bad. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=434.8s)]
*  I feel like we've had a pretty poor batting average with those as a country, but doesn't [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=437.44s)]
*  stop us from stepping up back up to the plate, usually. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=443.2s)]
*  So I'm not feeling overly confident that we'll avoid World War III, potentially, or whatever. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=446.03999999999996s)]
*  But I certainly hope so. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=451.68s)]
*  I hope that level heads prevail. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=453.36s)]
*  But I don't know, we'll see. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=455.03999999999996s)]
*  He could be just kicking the can down the road and waiting for it to shake out somehow [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=456.84s)]
*  in some other fashion. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=461.76s)]
*  I don't think it's, whatever the shrewdest thing is he could be doing, I don't think [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=462.91999999999996s)]
*  it's that, so. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=466.8s)]
*  Yeah, in terms of the kicking the can down the road, it's also possible. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=467.8s)]
*  So I mean, there was initial reports that he didn't want Israel to do this. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=471.08s)]
*  That's now very well established, no matter how much Carolyn Lee would pretend that this [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=476.91999999999996s)]
*  was always the plan. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=480.96s)]
*  And then he saw that Israel was pretty impressive in the first few days, and now he wants in [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=482.53999999999996s)]
*  on it. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=487.29999999999995s)]
*  He's feeling like FOMO or whatever. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=488.29999999999995s)]
*  And so if the two weeks go by and it's still going well, then maybe he thinks, well, this [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=490.0s)]
*  is a pretty safe thing. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=494.32s)]
*  I can get us involved or whatever. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=496.03999999999996s)]
*  And he's not gonna wanna look weak by virtue of the fact that Israel has just been doing [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=497.8s)]
*  this. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=501.91999999999996s)]
*  Or alternatively, if it starts to fail, and the perception is that Israel needed Trump's [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=502.91999999999996s)]
*  help but he didn't provide it, then he could look weak in that respect. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=508.2s)]
*  Which is why I just believe that it seems inevitable that we're gonna do something. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=512.36s)]
*  Now are we gonna be marching 50,000 soldiers across the border? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=516.36s)]
*  I don't know, but it's a massive country with a big military and these sorts of things can [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=519.24s)]
*  balloon out of control. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=523.54s)]
*  And we already know that he approved some sort of strike plans, including potentially [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=525.12s)]
*  the use of these bunker busters. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=530.32s)]
*  I feel like that's pretty much a lock at this point. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=532.22s)]
*  Again, I really hope that I am wrong, but I think it's entirely possible that he does [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=534.48s)]
*  that. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=538.88s)]
*  And if he does that, then it's almost certain that there will be reprisal attacks against [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=539.88s)]
*  the United States or its forces or its allies. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=542.64s)]
*  And that's very consequential. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=545.24s)]
*  He could have been in signing these orders, signing effectively the death warrant for [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=546.52s)]
*  a lot of our soldiers in the region. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=550.4000000000001s)]
*  And he has to know that. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=552.6800000000001s)]
*  And for him to do this when it didn't even seem like this is really, like he wanted to [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=554.52s)]
*  be involved. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=558.56s)]
*  I'm always ready to bad mouth and give him the least charitable interpretation of his [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=559.56s)]
*  motives. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=565.0s)]
*  And- That's true. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=566.0s)]
*  I have Trump derangement syndrome. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=567.0s)]
*  But it doesn't seem like two weeks ago he was hot for war with Iran. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=568.0s)]
*  I'll give him that credit. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=571.28s)]
*  And so for him to be manipulated or led into it is even more pathetic than him just being [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=573.04s)]
*  the hawk that he could have been or some other Republican president would have been. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=578.48s)]
*  And so it really is feeling like we're gonna be dragged in. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=582.68s)]
*  My best bet is we're gonna engage in, we're gonna try to destroy Fordo. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=585.9599999999999s)]
*  And depending on Iranian reprisals, maybe get drawn in and maybe it becomes a bigger [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=590.8399999999999s)]
*  thing. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=596.2399999999999s)]
*  Maybe it becomes a thing that involves years of conflict. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=597.2399999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=598.52s)]
*  But there is the Steve Bannon factor. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=599.52s)]
*  I know we're gonna be talking about that later in the show. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=601.5999999999999s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=603.5999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so I'm gonna touch on that a little bit. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=604.5999999999999s)]
*  There's two things I want to go over. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=606.3599999999999s)]
*  So where do the different parts of the Republican Party stand? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=607.76s)]
*  And who's the most culpable? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=611.96s)]
*  So the worst of the whole lot are the Republican politicians in Congress. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=613.44s)]
*  Outside of Thomas Massie, they're all warmongers. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=617.96s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor Greene is on the bubble. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=621.08s)]
*  She hasn't joined the War Powers Resolution, which would prevent the president from declaring [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=623.6s)]
*  war. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=629.12s)]
*  So right now she's full of crap. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=630.12s)]
*  She hasn't taken action to actually oppose the war. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=632.0s)]
*  She tweeted. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=635.2s)]
*  Yeah, she tweets, right? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=636.2s)]
*  And then look, by the way, that's better than not opposing it. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=637.96s)]
*  And she's doing that because her own voters are pushing her to do that, which I'll come [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=642.56s)]
*  back to. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=646.62s)]
*  Okay, so but the Republicans are 99% corrupt. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=647.62s)]
*  Other than Tom Massie, they all love the idea of this war and can't wait to serve APAC loyally. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=651.12s)]
*  So that's a stone cold fact. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=657.92s)]
*  If you're a Republican voter out there and you want to defend your precious little politicians, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=659.8s)]
*  go look at their voting record. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=664.56s)]
*  Go see if they join Massie in trying to assert constitutional authority for Congress to prevent [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=665.92s)]
*  war. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=671.56s)]
*  They didn't, okay? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=672.56s)]
*  So that's clear. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=673.8s)]
*  Trump is kind of, he's in the middle. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=674.9599999999999s)]
*  Why? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=678.9599999999999s)]
*  Because he's a good guy? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=679.9599999999999s)]
*  No, he's in the middle because his base, in my opinion, is largely against the war. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=680.9599999999999s)]
*  But his donors are all for the war. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=686.28s)]
*  And so he's like, and then he's got to surround himself with a bunch of neocons that Mary [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=688.7399999999999s)]
*  Madoff asked him to hire. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=693.02s)]
*  And they're all like, sir, this is very dangerous. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=694.02s)]
*  You'll look really weak and pathetic unless you just absolutely destroy Iran. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=696.8s)]
*  I mean, are you going to look so silly and not Trump a bunker buster? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=702.04s)]
*  I mean, you're looking weaker by the minute now. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=706.56s)]
*  And Israel did this brilliant strike. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=709.16s)]
*  Okay, so let's just pause there for a real quick story. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=712.0799999999999s)]
*  So part of the reason that we first put out a statement saying, hey, we didn't have anything [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=715.28s)]
*  new with this. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=719.68s)]
*  Marco Rubio did that on the first night. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=720.68s)]
*  And then by the morning, Trump had changed to, yeah, we were involved. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=722.5999999999999s)]
*  We gave them intelligence. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=726.76s)]
*  We deserve credit. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=728.04s)]
*  Wait, why credit, right? [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=729.04s)]
*  This Fox News ran a segment that morning saying that Israel's strikes were brilliant and strong. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=730.6s)]
*  So Trump then thought, I want to be brilliant and strong. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=737.8s)]
*  I was in on it. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=741.6s)]
*  I was in on it. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=742.6s)]
*  It's my credit for that. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=743.6s)]
*  He's such a simple minded guy, right? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=744.6s)]
*  But the fact that there's a countervailing force is what's so interesting. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=747.7s)]
*  Because that never existed. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=753.9399999999999s)]
*  Guys, we're the longest running show in internet history. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=754.94s)]
*  I covered the Iraq war before it got started. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=758.1800000000001s)]
*  There was no countervailing force, none, zero on the right. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=761.5400000000001s)]
*  They were all like, yes, let's attack, okay? [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=766.4000000000001s)]
*  100% of them, including Tucker Carlson at the time, including Donald Trump at the time, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=771.0200000000001s)]
*  all of them, okay? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=775.98s)]
*  Some of them switched a little later, some of them switched way, way, way later, decades [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=777.2600000000001s)]
*  later, right? [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=781.46s)]
*  And pretending they were against it. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=782.46s)]
*  No, they were all for it, okay? [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=783.58s)]
*  So now, finally we get to the bag of voters. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=785.38s)]
*  So no, more than half of them are actually into war. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=788.4200000000001s)]
*  I know that a lot of people on the left were like, no way, no way, you're crazy. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=791.48s)]
*  They're all called. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=795.86s)]
*  We're gonna talk more about it later in the show. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=796.86s)]
*  But guys, why would the voters lie? [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=799.5400000000001s)]
*  It's not like MAGA's shy about their opinions. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=802.7800000000001s)]
*  It's not like they're worried about offending you. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=805.6s)]
*  And all the other issues are like, yeah, goddamn, immigrants, round them all up. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=809.1s)]
*  Send in the Marines, right? [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=813.3s)]
*  They're not shy. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=814.62s)]
*  They're not a politician. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=815.62s)]
*  They're not taking donor money. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=817.78s)]
*  They have no reason to lie to you. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=818.78s)]
*  No, they really don't want the war. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=820.5s)]
*  Like any of you say, okay, they're right. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=822.62s)]
*  They all work for Laura Loomer. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=824.2199999999999s)]
*  Do they? [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=826.54s)]
*  Cuz Laura Loomer is fighting Tucker Carlson and Steve Bannon. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=827.54s)]
*  So if they all follow her orders, does that mean MAGA hates Tucker Carlson and Steve Bannon? [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=830.18s)]
*  No, they're actually split. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=835.02s)]
*  They're actually split. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=837.5799999999999s)]
*  So now that doesn't mean they're not gonna fall back in line. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=839.3s)]
*  We'll talk about that later in the show. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=841.4599999999999s)]
*  Okay, so now what do I think is gonna happen? [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=843.18s)]
*  This is the hardest one of all because I mean, Donald Trump nailed it. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=845.5s)]
*  This hilarious beginning to a sentence. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=849.34s)]
*  Wait for the second half when he said, nobody knows what I'm gonna do. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=851.62s)]
*  I'll probably do the same in the last second. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=857.3s)]
*  I'd like to do that. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=858.66s)]
*  I'm like, yeah, that sounds like him, yep. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=859.66s)]
*  So even Donald Trump doesn't know what he's gonna do. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=861.8s)]
*  So we're all guessing based on what we think we know about Trump, his base, his donors [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=864.1s)]
*  and all this stuff. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=869.02s)]
*  So what's my guess? [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=870.12s)]
*  75-25 that he bombs them, okay? [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=871.38s)]
*  So why? [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=875.26s)]
*  Because Iran is not gonna come back to the table and do an unconditional surrender. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=876.3s)]
*  That's what Trump wants. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=880.9s)]
*  Now before they almost had a deal where Iran said, we'll stop enriching uranium at the [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=882.1s)]
*  military where we get anywhere near the military level. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=887.58s)]
*  And we'll enrich uranium under controlled circumstances, monitor for just energy purposes, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=891.1s)]
*  which is what they were doing in the past, which is basically the Obama deal, right? [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=896.42s)]
*  And Israel said, no, we veto that deal. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=900.3s)]
*  They have to take away their entire uranium program. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=903.2199999999999s)]
*  But that for them, for whatever reason, is a red line. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=905.9399999999999s)]
*  And that they view that to be a national humiliation if they have to do that. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=909.2199999999999s)]
*  So it is very, very unlikely they'll do that. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=913.2199999999999s)]
*  So since Iran is not going to come back and go, okay, we pray y'all, we surrender, we [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=916.2199999999999s)]
*  surrender, dear Donald Trump. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=921.3s)]
*  He's probably gonna take offense to that. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=923.38s)]
*  He's gonna be easier to manipulate. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=924.9s)]
*  So 75-25 at least that he attacks. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=926.78s)]
*  And MAGA is not helping at this point cuz they're retreating a lot of them like Bannon [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=930.04s)]
*  and Trump. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=933.4s)]
*  I mean Bannon and Tucker, I'll tell you in a minute, not in a minute but a little bit [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=934.4s)]
*  later in the show, are beginning to retreat. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=938.64s)]
*  Okay, so last thing is then what do I think is gonna happen after the bombing if that [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=941.68s)]
*  happens? [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=947.0s)]
*  Well, Israel is gonna say not good enough. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=948.0s)]
*  You didn't destroy their whole facility. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=949.8399999999999s)]
*  You should have dropped the nuke. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=951.26s)]
*  You should have done ground troops. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=953.04s)]
*  You should have done regime change. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=954.8399999999999s)]
*  And Israel might assassinate Ayatollah Hamanias. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=956.52s)]
*  They're threatening to do now, okay? [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=959.24s)]
*  In which case, we'll be in the middle of a giant mess. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=961.44s)]
*  And then Trump will get more and more and more unpopular. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=964.62s)]
*  MAGA will then the half of MAGA that hated the war will go, I thought we were just dropping [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=967.8s)]
*  a bomb and now we're in the middle of this giant mess, just like we didn't want to be, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=973.04s)]
*  right? [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=977.04s)]
*  And this is the super bold prediction. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=978.04s)]
*  And I understand there's a series of steps to even get to a place where this might happen. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=980.84s)]
*  And if all that happens, I think that Donald Trump will leave in the middle of the war. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=985.96s)]
*  And Israel will be like, wait, what? [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=990.9200000000001s)]
*  You can't leave in the middle of the war. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=992.6s)]
*  We're in this war together and Trump will be like, I don't know, it's costing too much. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=994.48s)]
*  MAGA doesn't like it. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=998.52s)]
*  It hurt my popularity. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=999.72s)]
*  Where's my new bribe? [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=1001.4000000000001s)]
*  If you don't have a new bribe, I'm gone. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=1002.4000000000001s)]
*  Okay, that's my guess. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=1004.72s)]
*  Well, we'll see. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=1006.36s)]
*  I hope none of that happens. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=1007.36s)]
*  I hope we don't bomb them. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=1008.36s)]
*  I also hope we don't bomb them. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=1009.36s)]
*  And I'm also not overly optimistic for like 75, 25. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=1010.84s)]
*  That's probably pretty good odds. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=1013.8s)]
*  Cuz like when the last time we chose not to bomb a place, we spent all this money on all [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=1015.1999999999999s)]
*  these sweet toys. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=1020.16s)]
*  There's a lot of people in DC that just really like to use them. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=1021.16s)]
*  We have wars, war is a big, big cottage industry over here in the US. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=1025.08s)]
*  So I mean, I'm always worried that we're gonna leap into another one. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=1029.8799999999999s)]
*  I agree with you too. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=1033.8s)]
*  Like I'm also glad that there just are even factions, like you said, a countervailing force [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=1034.8s)]
*  on the right right now. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=1039.6399999999999s)]
*  It's been weird. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=1040.96s)]
*  It does make for like strange bedfellows because so far, the ones who are like against it, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=1041.96s)]
*  a lot of times it's the more typically loonier type of Republican, the more hardcore like [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=1046.24s)]
*  MAGA type. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=1051.72s)]
*  So it's been putting me in positions I never thought I'd be in before like watching Tucker [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=1052.8799999999999s)]
*  Carlson dress down Ted Cruz. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=1056.96s)]
*  And I'm sitting there thinking like, hell man, Tucker spit and get him Tucker. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=1059.1599999999999s)]
*  It's like I never thought I'd think that would that's just a testament to just how much Ted [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=1063.1599999999999s)]
*  Cruz sucks. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=1066.24s)]
*  But like it is, it is, you know, it's weird sort of agreeing with him on anything. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=1067.56s)]
*  But this is we're talking about war here. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=1073.32s)]
*  And it's like whether whatever their motivations are, because a lot of people said about Tucker [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=1074.96s)]
*  and some of those types, it's like, it's just because he's a Russian stooge and that's what [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=1078.68s)]
*  Russia wants or whatever. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=1081.8s)]
*  But it's like, you know, it's still kind of they can fall back backwards into being right [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=1082.84s)]
*  about any one given thing. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=1087.6s)]
*  You know, they say about broken clocks and blind squirrels and all that. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=1089.24s)]
*  I just don't want there to be war. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=1092.36s)]
*  But I'm worried that there will because like you guys said, it just it just feels like [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=1094.8s)]
*  the thing that we would do in any administration. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=1099.04s)]
*  But this one in particular, also, I'll say this is seems like maybe one of the worst [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=1101.4s)]
*  times in any of our living memory for a new war to start, given the leadership at the [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=1105.2s)]
*  top of our of our military right now. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=1111.24s)]
*  They don't exactly inspire confidence. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=1114.24s)]
*  So that's also alarming. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=1116.92s)]
*  But yeah, it's we'll see what happens. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gwrC6L8Kj4&t=1118.84s)]
