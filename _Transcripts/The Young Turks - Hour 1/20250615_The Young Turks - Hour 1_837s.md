# What Is Going On In This Immigration Poll?
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0)
*  When you're against legal immigration, you're against America. Because what makes this country [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=0.0s)]
*  great is the legal immigration, is the fact that this is a nation of immigrants. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=5.44s)]
*  More so than any other group that I could find the group of voters who became more hawkish [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=9.92s)]
*  on immigration, where in fact immigrants themselves, immigrants who are registered to vote in this [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=15.36s)]
*  country. This morning, CNN's Harry Enton revealed that the voters who have shifted [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=21.44s)]
*  the most to the right on the topic of immigration policy are actually immigrants themselves. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=29.68s)]
*  So there had already been polling and data to indicate that naturalized citizens [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=37.36s)]
*  had shifted somewhat to the right when it came to immigration policy. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  But this latest polling really shows you the extent to which they have. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  And so according to Enton, those numbers really helped to explain part of what's motivating [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=53.04s)]
*  President Donald Trump to do what he's been doing in cities like Los Angeles. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=59.28s)]
*  So before we get to that though, let's watch Enton explain how immigrants used to feel toward the [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=64.56s)]
*  Democratic Party's handling of immigration. Closest to or trust more in immigration, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=71.76s)]
*  you go back to 2020. Democrats get this, held a 32 point lead on this issue. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=77.76s)]
*  Immigrant voters were in the Democratic camp. Jump forward to 2024, 2025. Look at that shift, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=82.88s)]
*  a 40 point shift to the right among immigrant voters. Republicans now lead on this issue [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=88.24s)]
*  by eight points over Democrats. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=95.75999999999999s)]
*  All right, so now immigrant voters also feel much differently about the undocumented immigrants [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=97.91999999999999s)]
*  now compared to 2020. So you get the context of how they used to feel, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=105.19999999999999s)]
*  how are they feeling now? Let's take a look. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=109.6s)]
*  The net favorable rating, immigrants who are here illegally among immigrant citizens, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=111.67999999999999s)]
*  again, those registered to vote. In 2020, look at this, plus 23 points on the net favorable rating. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=115.28s)]
*  But look at where we were in 2024, minus six points underwater. So immigrant citizens have [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=120.64s)]
*  become increasingly unfavorable in their views of those immigrants who are here illegally. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=126.16s)]
*  And guess what? That shift goes beyond the issue of immigration specifically. So it also plays out [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=131.68s)]
*  in the number of immigrant voters who voted for Trump in 2016 versus 2024. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=137.68s)]
*  And so I'm gonna explain what I think about all of this. I just want you to have all the [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=144.4s)]
*  numbers first. So let's take a quick look at that and then I'll fill in the blanks. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=147.6s)]
*  You remember when he first ran back in 2016, immigrant voters are one of his weakest box. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=150.64000000000001s)]
*  But look at this, Trump's vote chair in presidential election, among again, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=155.28s)]
*  immigrant citizens, those who registered to vote. Look at this, 2016, he got 36% of the vote. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=158.32s)]
*  You go to 2020, 39% of the vote. Look at this in 2024, all the way up to 47% of the vote. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=162.32s)]
*  Some polls I looked at had him barely losing that vote. Some polls I looked at had him [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=169.6s)]
*  barely winning that vote. Again, there is no block of voters that shifted more to the right [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=173.44s)]
*  from 2020 to 2024 than immigrant voters. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=178.8s)]
*  Now, before we get to Enten's analysis of all of this, why this big shift [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=182.8s)]
*  exists to begin with, what he thinks is motivating it, I just wanna say I told you. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=190.8s)]
*  I told you. So in the lead up to the presidential race, for everyone who was mad and upset at me [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=196.8s)]
*  when I drew attention to the fact that there was a migrant crisis at the border, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=206.24s)]
*  that Greg Abbott busing or flying migrants to big blue cities like Chicago, LA, whatever. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=211.12s)]
*  All of these big blue, New York City is another example, Colorado, Denver. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=219.84s)]
*  I knew that that was going to have an impact on the outcome of the presidential race, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=225.04000000000002s)]
*  but I also knew that it would have an overall impact on the public's sentiment toward immigration [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=230.56s)]
*  policy. There is a reason why even today, Trump enjoys a slim majority of support among Americans [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=239.04000000000002s)]
*  when it comes to his immigration policies, and it's because the Democrats dropped the ball. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=247.92000000000002s)]
*  When you drop the ball and you have a migrant crisis and you essentially respond to that [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=252.24s)]
*  migrant crisis by telling Americans it doesn't exist, it's all in your imagination, you're crazy, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=256.24s)]
*  you must be a bigot for even mentioning it, that leads to backlash, that leads to resentment. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=262.72s)]
*  Now, of course, the Biden administration and the Democrats realized, wow, we did drop the ball. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=270.96s)]
*  This is gonna be a political liability for the 2024 presidential election. Maybe we should do [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=275.68s)]
*  something. Let's hit up our homeboy, Senator Lankford from Oklahoma and get him to write [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=280.64s)]
*  a right wing immigration bill that will quickly pass in order to ensure that this immigration [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=288.08s)]
*  issue isn't a problem for us electorally. Well, obviously, they dropped the ball so badly [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=293.67999999999995s)]
*  that the Republicans had no incentive to help them. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=299.91999999999996s)]
*  Trump had no incentive to want to help Biden or Kamala Harris, so of course, he stood in the way [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=302.88s)]
*  of passing that bill, he blocked that bill. Guys, there are consequences when the Democratic Party [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=307.84s)]
*  creates a vacuum and doesn't appropriately respond to the concerns of the American people. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=313.03999999999996s)]
*  When the American people say, we are worried about this, we are struggling with this, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=319.28s)]
*  we need your help, and the response from the Democrats is, it's not happening. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=323.28s)]
*  That vacuum that's created then gets filled by the party who says, we have a plan, we have a [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=328.32s)]
*  solution, we're gonna do something about it. And by that point, there's so much resentment built in [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=334.96s)]
*  these various communities that have been dealing with an influx of migrants that they're willing [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=340.47999999999996s)]
*  to accept some of the most draconian immigration policies, and that's where we currently are at. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=347.35999999999996s)]
*  So when I talk about these things, I just wanna make it very clear. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=353.28s)]
*  I don't talk about these things because I hate immigrants. My parents are immigrants, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=357.59999999999997s)]
*  I grew up in a community of immigrants. People who wanna come to this country should have a legal [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=362.15999999999997s)]
*  pathway to citizenship. We need to fix our broken immigration system. But I mentioned these things [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=367.2s)]
*  specifically because my job here is to give analysis and talk about how the Democratic Party [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=372.8s)]
*  could have moved forward in a way that was electorally beneficial for them. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=380.4s)]
*  But rather than take any responsibility, both the Democratic Party and the Democratic Party [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=385.2s)]
*  responsibility, both the Democratic Party and the people who like to provide cover for their [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=389.68s)]
*  failures jumped down my throat and accused me of being a Trump fanatic for speaking out against [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=394.72s)]
*  the failures of the Democratic Party. Okay, well, now you're seeing what we're dealing with as a [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=402.0s)]
*  result of those failures. And maybe we learn lessons moving forward, but I doubt it, I doubt it. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=407.76s)]
*  Now with that in mind, let's hear what Harry Enton has to say. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=413.12s)]
*  Okay. So I think it's so important when we're talking about this debate from a political [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=415.6s)]
*  angle to separate those out who are undocumented immigrants versus those who are here legally, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=420.48s)]
*  and those who are citizens, and those who are voters. Because that group of voters has felt [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=425.76000000000005s)]
*  increasingly distant from those immigrants who are here legally. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=430.8s)]
*  And so again, when we're talking about this, at least from a political angle, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=434.0s)]
*  this is why Donald Trump feels so comfortable. Because in fact, amongst the group that you would [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=436.88s)]
*  think that would be most opposed to this, in fact, they become increasingly favorable, not [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=440.64000000000004s)]
*  just towards Donald Trump, but towards a Republican point of view on immigration, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=445.04s)]
*  and becoming distant from those immigrants who are here illegally. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=448.48s)]
*  And the other thing is, look, there are people who came to this country the legal way, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=451.44s)]
*  and they went through the insanely difficult process of becoming American citizens. Becoming [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=459.6s)]
*  a naturalized citizen is not easy. And so I'm sure that among some of these people who have [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=466.48s)]
*  gone through that process, there's a bit of resentment. It's like, what the hell? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=473.2s)]
*  It's costly, it's difficult, it's time consuming, it takes years, but I went through it the legal [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=476.47999999999996s)]
*  way, why can't everyone else? But look, for those who are naturalized citizens who kind of share [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=482.88s)]
*  that sentiment, I just wanna say, it shouldn't be so difficult that people give up on the legal [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=489.2s)]
*  process of entering the country and becoming naturalized citizens that they then resort to [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=496.0s)]
*  doing it illegally, right? We do have a broken immigration system, and it's broken on purpose. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=501.6s)]
*  I wanna be clear about that. You think employers want to fix our broken immigration system so [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=508.08000000000004s)]
*  people have a legal pathway to citizenship, where they have whatever labor protections we have on a [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=514.48s)]
*  federal level, where they have to get paid minimum wage or else the workers would have recourse [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=521.12s)]
*  against the employer? They don't want that. The broken immigration system has benefited [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=526.5600000000001s)]
*  corporations the most, companies the most, the agriculture industry in this country the most. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=531.36s)]
*  So we have to be clear about that as well. Now, Steve Bannon referenced this data and this [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=537.36s)]
*  polling that was reported by Harry Enton during a segment in which he called for the arrests of [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=544.0s)]
*  10 million illegal immigrants, our economy would be destroyed, okay? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=549.28s)]
*  I don't think people realize just how disastrous that would be. And no, I'm not gonna make those [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=554.0799999999999s)]
*  gross callous statements about how we need immigrants to clean our houses or no, no, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=559.04s)]
*  but immigrants do a lot of important jobs throughout this country. So just flat out [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=564.8s)]
*  deporting 10 million people is gonna be disruptive, to say the least, and not just disruptive to their [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=570.0799999999999s)]
*  lives, disruptive to all of our lives and to our economy. He also wants Alejandro Mayorkas and [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=576.64s)]
*  former President Joe Biden to be arrested, okay? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=583.28s)]
*  So here's what he said this morning. ICE should triple down today in Los Angeles. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=588.24s)]
*  All 10 million have to go. Does he think all 10 million are in LA? What is that? All 10 million [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=592.4s)]
*  have to go, not just the criminals and the insane asylum. The Democrats are on the wrong side of [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=598.3199999999999s)]
*  this. Look at Harry Enton. We can play much more of Harry Enton sitting there going, this is [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=605.28s)]
*  absolutely the issue the United States wants. They want their sovereignty back. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=610.72s)]
*  And then he says, you know who wants it? Hispanic citizens and African American citizens. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=615.6800000000001s)]
*  They want these festering, okay, I don't even wanna read this, but these festering sores [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=620.48s)]
*  of these big cities like Los Angeles cleaned up, the schools cleaned up, the medical system [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=627.84s)]
*  cleaned up. And at the same time, let's get Mayorkas and Biden and the entire crowd arrest them. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=632.88s)]
*  Meanwhile, the likes of Charlie Kirk, Jack Posobiec and Matt Walsh are calling for a ban [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=641.2s)]
*  on immigration altogether. And note how they all have the same wording in their posts. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=646.8000000000001s)]
*  Seems like this is an organized, orchestrated thing. They're taking orders from someone and [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=653.6800000000001s)]
*  being good boys in essentially posting the exact same wording here. And this is what it says. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=660.24s)]
*  It's time to ban third world immigration. Yeah, third world immigration built this country. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=665.36s)]
*  Okay, but anyway, legal or illegal. I mean, at least they're telling the truth now, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=670.72s)]
*  because before they had the ball, right? They were pretending like, no, we're not against [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=680.4s)]
*  immigrants. We're just against illegal immigration. We're not against, you guys are against immigrants, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=684.32s)]
*  period. Whether legal or illegal, as they're clearly stating right there, and it's disgusting. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=688.8000000000001s)]
*  This crap is disgusting. This is the crap that in my view is totally un-American. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=694.08s)]
*  When you're against legal immigration, you're against America. Because what makes this country [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=700.08s)]
*  great is the legal immigration, is the fact that this is a nation of immigrants. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=705.76s)]
*  Okay, living in a diverse place like Los Angeles is not a knock on Los Angeles. That's actually one [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=711.0400000000001s)]
*  of the best things about living in LA. It's just so utterly disgusting and gross. And who's your [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=717.6s)]
*  boss? Who are you serving as a puppet for here? Literally the exact same wording in all three of [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=724.24s)]
*  these tweets. I understand wanting to control immigration because we do have finite resources. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=730.64s)]
*  I'm not an open borders person. And I think most people, if they stop and actually think about [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=737.52s)]
*  what open borders mean, they wouldn't be open borders either. But this isn't about controlling [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=741.52s)]
*  immigration. This is just about preventing immigrants from coming in under any and all [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=747.12s)]
*  circumstances. And I find that gross. Now, Matt Walsh responded to a post calling out [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=752.16s)]
*  that almost identical messaging. I'll just say it, Nick Fuentes called him out for [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=757.6s)]
*  similar messaging. Not even similar, it's like word for word the same tweets. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=763.92s)]
*  And then so did Ian Smith. I love how the conservatives have always pointed out that [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=769.6s)]
*  the liberals and their politicians put out brand messaging at the same time as if they were given [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=775.4399999999999s)]
*  some sort of memo from their higher ups. This is definitely not what is happening right here. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=781.04s)]
*  Take a look at your thought leaders representing conservative Inc. sharing their homework [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=786.3199999999999s)]
*  assignments. Matt Walsh responds and says that Charlie's and Jack's posts were in direct response [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=791.04s)]
*  to mine. You guys tweeted the exact same thing. Matt, you're taking orders. You're taking orders [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=796.64s)]
*  from someone. Just be honest. Just be honest. It's the exact same wording. What are you doing? [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=803.28s)]
*  Anyway, which you've cut out for the sake of making whatever dumbass point you're trying to [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=807.8399999999999s)]
*  make here. I said something and then Charlie and Jack agreed with it and literally used the exact [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=814.16s)]
*  same phrasing, wording, terminology. Got it. I know it's embarrassing to be called out for being [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=819.28s)]
*  a puppet, but if the shoe fits. Every time you ring the bell below, an angel gets a swings. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=826.88s)]
*  Totally not true, but it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31bd5LBzBI0&t=833.1999999999999s)]
