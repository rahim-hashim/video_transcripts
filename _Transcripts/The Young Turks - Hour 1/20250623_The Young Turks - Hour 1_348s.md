TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.
The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.
On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.
Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.
Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.
TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

# Pro-Israel Lobbyist's Scheme JUST PLAYED OUT With Trump's Bombing Of Iran
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8)
*  Back in September of 2012, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=0.0s)]
*  a pro-Israel lobbyist, I mean, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=2.58s)]
*  he's part of this think tank that [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=5.28s)]
*  tends to push narratives that are [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  favorable to Israel and [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=9.94s)]
*  Israel's foreign policy. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=11.42s)]
*  His name's Patrick Claussen was [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=13.18s)]
*  speaking at an event. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=15.18s)]
*  It was the policy forum in [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=16.62s)]
*  Washington DC, and he was talking [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=18.52s)]
*  about what could be done to go to [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=21.12s)]
*  war with Iran. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=23.42s)]
*  I'm not even kidding. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=25.16s)]
*  So this is 2012 under Obama. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=25.98s)]
*  Remember, three years later in [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=28.56s)]
*  2015, Obama did one of the best [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=30.299999999999997s)]
*  things in his presidency, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=31.799999999999997s)]
*  which was get Iran to sign [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=33.14s)]
*  a nuclear deal. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=34.36s)]
*  They stopped enriching their [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=35.42s)]
*  uranium. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=37.019999999999996s)]
*  Unfortunately, Trump ripped up that [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=37.72s)]
*  deal in 2018, which led to Iran [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=40.0s)]
*  enriching uranium. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=41.76s)]
*  But nonetheless, three years prior [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=43.82s)]
*  to the Iran nuclear deal, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=45.879999999999995s)]
*  here's what Patrick Claussen had [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=47.32s)]
*  to say, take a look. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=49.3s)]
*  I frankly think that crisis [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=51.96s)]
*  initiation is really tough. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=53.42s)]
*  And it's very hard for [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=55.72s)]
*  me to see how the United States [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=56.940000000000005s)]
*  President can get us to war with [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=58.72s)]
*  Iran, which leads me to conclude [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=60.36s)]
*  that if in fact compromise is not [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=62.260000000000005s)]
*  coming, that the traditional way [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=64.26s)]
*  of America gets to war is what [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=66.34s)]
*  would be best for US interests. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=68.26s)]
*  Some people might think that Mr. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=70.34s)]
*  Roosevelt wanted to get us into [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=72.34s)]
*  World War II, as David mentioned, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=74.22s)]
*  you may recall we had to wait for [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=76.18s)]
*  Pearl Harbor. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=77.92s)]
*  Some people might think Mr. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=78.64s)]
*  Wilson wanted to get us into World [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=80.26s)]
*  War I, you may recall he had to [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=82.18s)]
*  wait for World War II, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=84.02000000000001s)]
*  you may recall he had to wait for [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=85.58s)]
*  the Lusitania episode. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=87.02s)]
*  Some people might think that Mr. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=88.78s)]
*  Johnson wanted to send troops to [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=90.18s)]
*  Vietnam, you may recall we had to [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=91.56s)]
*  wait for the Gulf of Tonkin episode. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=92.94s)]
*  We didn't go to war with Spain [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=95.58s)]
*  until the main exploded. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=97.38s)]
*  And may I point out that Mr. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=100.02s)]
*  Lincoln did not feel he could call [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=101.7s)]
*  out the Federal Army until [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=103.5s)]
*  Fort Sumter was attacked. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=104.82000000000001s)]
*  Which is why he ordered the [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=106.36s)]
*  commander at Fort Sumter to do [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=107.62s)]
*  exactly that thing which [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=109.06s)]
*  the South Carolinians had said [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=110.24000000000001s)]
*  would cause an attack. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=111.86s)]
*  So if in fact the Iranians aren't [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=113.98s)]
*  going to compromise, it would be [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=115.78s)]
*  best if somebody else started [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=117.54s)]
*  the war. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=118.98s)]
*  What did you mean by that? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=123.94s)]
*  If somebody else started the war? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=125.5s)]
*  So I assume that he means because [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=128.74s)]
*  we know that there's no [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=131.54s)]
*  justification for this war. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=133.7s)]
*  We need Israel will attack Iran, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=136.7s)]
*  start the war, and [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=139.06s)]
*  then drag America into it. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=140.46s)]
*  Or something needs to happen, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=142.98s)]
*  some sort of event, some sort of [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=144.78s)]
*  terrible thing needs to happen that [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=146.57999999999998s)]
*  impacts Americans. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=148.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=150.94s)]
*  That would drum up support to go to [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=151.45999999999998s)]
*  war with Iran. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=152.78s)]
*  Well, okay, that's what's happening [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=153.62s)]
*  today, that was in 2012. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=156.1s)]
*  It's interestingly right between [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=157.89999999999998s)]
*  now and September 11th and [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=160.29999999999998s)]
*  September 11th obviously was [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=162.38s)]
*  a cataclysmic event here in America. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=164.62s)]
*  And we did go to war with Iraq [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=167.26s)]
*  afterwards and Iraq had nothing to [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=169.14s)]
*  do with 9-11. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=171.7s)]
*  But to be fair, they had weapons, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=173.17999999999998s)]
*  no, they also had no weapons of [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=174.94s)]
*  mass destruction. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=176.42s)]
*  And you want to know where we got [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=177.98s)]
*  the fake intelligence on the weapons [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=179.29999999999998s)]
*  of mass destruction? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=180.73999999999998s)]
*  Our beloved ally Israel gave us [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=181.98s)]
*  that fake intelligence. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=183.89999999999998s)]
*  So and remember, whenever Ted Cruz [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=185.82s)]
*  or anybody else is asked about it, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=187.61999999999998s)]
*  what does Israel do for us? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=189.38s)]
*  They give us intelligence, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=190.73999999999998s)]
*  fake intelligence to drive us into [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=192.66s)]
*  war after war after war. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=194.82s)]
*  And at the time, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=196.66s)]
*  Israeli leaders said Iraq is our [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=197.94s)]
*  number one enemy, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=200.42000000000002s)]
*  Israel's number one enemy. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=201.74s)]
*  And right now before this war [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=203.38s)]
*  began, they said Iran is their [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=205.38s)]
*  number one enemy. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=207.46s)]
*  And look at that, we're in a war [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=208.94s)]
*  with both of them. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=210.78s)]
*  And interestingly enough, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=212.3s)]
*  Israel started one here, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=214.1s)]
*  the one you guys just saw with your [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=215.7s)]
*  own eyes, and the other one was [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=217.62s)]
*  after a cataclysmic event here [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=219.3s)]
*  in America. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=220.94s)]
*  Yeah, it's just, I thought the [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=221.66s)]
*  whole framing of what he was saying [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=223.74s)]
*  there was a little sick, right? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=226.06s)]
*  Because it's like, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=228.06s)]
*  I really want to go to war with [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=229.46s)]
*  Iran. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=231.18s)]
*  But historically speaking, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=231.7s)]
*  when the US finally did decide to [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=233.5s)]
*  go to war in other contexts, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=235.58s)]
*  obviously, they had to wait for [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=237.34s)]
*  something devastating to happen to [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=239.14s)]
*  Americans or to our soldiers, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=241.38s)]
*  in the case of Pearl Harbor, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=243.26s)]
*  for instance. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=244.9s)]
*  I mean, luckily, you had a [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=247.06s)]
*  president at the time, Obama, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=248.9s)]
*  who was legitimately pursuing [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=251.18s)]
*  diplomacy to get a nuclear deal [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=253.57999999999998s)]
*  signed with Iran. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=255.98s)]
*  Yeah, one more thing about that. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=258.02000000000004s)]
*  Look, so right now, I don't know [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=259.62s)]
*  that they've even gotten enough [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=261.54s)]
*  support for us to do regime change. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=263.46000000000004s)]
*  That's maybe why Trump announced [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=265.42s)]
*  the so-called ceasefire today. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=267.78000000000003s)]
*  And there's been pushback from some [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=270.5s)]
*  portions of his base and [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=272.62s)]
*  his voters, etc. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=274.1s)]
*  But if they were able to get Iran [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=275.42s)]
*  to counterattack and hit US troops, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=277.86s)]
*  boom, you'd have all you would need [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=280.70000000000005s)]
*  for regime change. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=283.34000000000003s)]
*  So start the war, agitate, agitate, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=284.98s)]
*  drag America into it, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=287.14000000000004s)]
*  wait for Americans to get killed, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=288.38s)]
*  and then step aside as America [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=290.26000000000005s)]
*  fights your war for you. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=291.82000000000005s)]
*  But I'm sorry, we can't say these [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=293.14000000000004s)]
*  things that are super obvious that [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=295.14000000000004s)]
*  we're all seeing with our own eyes [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=297.22s)]
*  as it happens right now. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=299.22s)]
*  And by the way, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=300.58000000000004s)]
*  fun little fact, people like Bill [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=301.34000000000003s)]
*  Kristol, who were part of the Neocons, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=303.14000000000004s)]
*  who were ready to start this war if [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=305.26000000000005s)]
*  Kamala Harris had won, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=307.26000000000005s)]
*  are now beginning to go, Trump, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=308.62s)]
*  not so bad. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=310.58000000000004s)]
*  100%, I mean, that's, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=311.38s)]
*  Bill Kristol has always been a snake. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=313.1s)]
*  And for all the Democrats who are [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=315.82s)]
*  fooled by him and all of the other [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=317.86s)]
*  Bush administration, Neocons, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=319.82s)]
*  who are like, MSNBC was littered [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=321.86s)]
*  with them and continues to be [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=323.82s)]
*  littered with them, just dig a [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=325.54s)]
*  little bit deeper, please. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=327.54s)]
*  Just because you share an enemy, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=329.3s)]
*  Donald Trump, doesn't mean that [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=331.26s)]
*  these are good people. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=333.14s)]
*  These are people who dragged us [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=334.58s)]
*  into the forever wars, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=336.26s)]
*  drain this country of its [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=337.65999999999997s)]
*  resources, just complete and [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=339.18s)]
*  utter disastrous people. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=340.78s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyzLg7o3o8&t=342.42s)]
