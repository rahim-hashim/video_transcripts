"Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth shared detailed information about forthcoming strikes in Yemen on March 15 in a private Signal group chat that included his wife, brother and personal lawyer, according to four people with knowledge of the chat.

Some of those people said that the information Mr. Hegseth shared on the Signal chat included the flight schedules for the F/A-18 Hornets targeting the Houthis in Yemen ‚Äî essentially the same attack plans that he shared on a separate Signal chat the same day that mistakenly included the editor of The Atlantic."

TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.

TYT‚Äôs 24/7 programming is available on YouTube TV, Samsung TV, Plus, Roku, Xumo, TCLtv+, Fubo, and more.

TYT is also available as a podcast on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, TuneIn, Amazon Music, and more.

# BREAKING NEWS: Pete Hegseth Is Reportedly On THIN ICE At The Pentagon
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [April 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI)
*  Earlier today, NPR reported that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=0.0s)]
*  the White House is looking for [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=2.1s)]
*  possible replacements for [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=3.84s)]
*  Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=5.4s)]
*  Now the Defense Department under [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=7.5s)]
*  his leadership has kind of been [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=9.1s)]
*  in shambles. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=10.4s)]
*  There's been a lot of scandal, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=10.94s)]
*  a lot of drama, a lot of infighting [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=12.42s)]
*  because of the differing views on [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=14.24s)]
*  what the US foreign policy should [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=16.04s)]
*  be. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=17.96s)]
*  Now, the reporting from NPR didn't [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=19.04s)]
*  really get into too many details. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=21.8s)]
*  They basically reported that [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=25.42s)]
*  the White House had begun the [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=27.1s)]
*  process of looking for [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=28.84s)]
*  a new Secretary of Defense, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=29.96s)]
*  according to a US official who was [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=31.32s)]
*  not authorized to speak publicly. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=33.120000000000005s)]
*  Now following that report, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=35.52s)]
*  Caroline Levitt, White House press [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=36.72s)]
*  secretary denied it, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=38.1s)]
*  she called it fake news. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=39.0s)]
*  But then Eric Erickson, who's [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=40.28s)]
*  a conservative radio show host, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=42.36s)]
*  began to confirm it on Twitter or [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=44.58s)]
*  X responding to other people's [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=46.760000000000005s)]
*  comments and stuff like that. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=48.96s)]
*  He said that people in the White [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=51.36s)]
*  House are looking at possible [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=52.96s)]
*  Secretary of Defense replacements. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=54.36s)]
*  Trump is not inclined to replace [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=55.92s)]
*  the Secretary of Defense. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=57.64s)]
*  People in the White House believe [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=59.480000000000004s)]
*  more is coming on Hegseth that will [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=61.6s)]
*  turn Trump toward wanting [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=63.64s)]
*  a replacement. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=65.3s)]
*  Now I want to be clear, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=66.88s)]
*  Eric Erickson is not a fan [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=67.88s)]
*  of Donald Trump's. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  I'm taking what he's saying at [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=70.64s)]
*  face value because what do you know [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=72.28s)]
*  that we don't know? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=74.24000000000001s)]
*  What are your sources? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=75.08s)]
*  Do you have any receipts to show [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=76.44s)]
*  us? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=77.80000000000001s)]
*  And the fact that he doesn't like [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=78.30000000000001s)]
*  the Trump administration makes me [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=79.76s)]
*  take what he's saying with [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=81.2s)]
*  a grain of salt at the moment until [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=82.32000000000001s)]
*  I actually see some more evidence. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=83.88s)]
*  But I wouldn't be surprised if [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=85.84s)]
*  the Trump administration [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=87.2s)]
*  ultimately replaces Hegseth. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=88.4s)]
*  Yeah, so look, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=90.44s)]
*  these are the type of stories where [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=91.2s)]
*  I'm like, well, we'll find out, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=92.84s)]
*  right? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=94.24000000000001s)]
*  Because the right wing will say, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=94.76s)]
*  no way, man, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=96.44s)]
*  this is all fake news, etc. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=97.2s)]
*  And the left wing will say, no, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=98.76s)]
*  we know for sure. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=100.64s)]
*  None of us know for sure. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=102.16s)]
*  But right now it doesn't look good. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=103.4s)]
*  There's a lot of blowups at [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=104.64s)]
*  the Defense Department. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=105.64s)]
*  It looks like a mess. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=106.64s)]
*  He accidentally leaked our war [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=107.52000000000001s)]
*  plans several different times. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=109.36s)]
*  So if they're looking for [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=111.52000000000001s)]
*  a replacement, it wouldn't be [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=112.52000000000001s)]
*  earth shattering news, right? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=113.92s)]
*  And it makes some degree of sense. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=116.12s)]
*  But then if Trump decides to stick [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=117.52000000000001s)]
*  with him, then they'll pretend [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=118.92s)]
*  the whole thing was fake news in [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=120.24000000000001s)]
*  the first place. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=121.44s)]
*  But to me, that's not [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=122.52000000000001s)]
*  the important part. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=123.52000000000001s)]
*  The important part is, why are they [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=124.28s)]
*  trying to replace him? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=126.76s)]
*  Is it because he's got some [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=128.6s)]
*  personal issues or whatever else [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=130.16s)]
*  it might be, or for policy reasons? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=131.92000000000002s)]
*  That's the most relevant part. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=134.4s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=135.84s)]
*  Further, Erickson says it's not [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=137.28s)]
*  the president, but those around him [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=138.84s)]
*  who expect more shoes to drop that [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=140.56s)]
*  turn the president against Hegseth, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=142.20000000000002s)]
*  and they're trying to get ready for [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=144.08s)]
*  it. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=145.76s)]
*  So buckle up, it seems like there [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=146.12s)]
*  might be some more revelations [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=147.92s)]
*  coming from the Defense Department [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=149.72s)]
*  and we'll see, we'll see what it [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=151.88s)]
*  is. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=153.56s)]
*  Yeah, and look, the fact that it's [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=154.06s)]
*  both NPR and Eric Erickson, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=156.39999999999998s)]
*  who is a right winger confirming [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=158.23999999999998s)]
*  from people inside the White House [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=160.39999999999998s)]
*  that they're looking at a list. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=162.64s)]
*  By the way, they're saying, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=164.6s)]
*  it's not Trump that's looking [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=165.64s)]
*  at the list, they're going to take [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=166.84s)]
*  it to Trump. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=168.2s)]
*  It's other people making a list. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=168.92s)]
*  By the way, if I was in the White [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=170.48s)]
*  House and I was the chief of staff, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=172.12s)]
*  I'd be looking at a list. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=174.0s)]
*  Because I'd be thinking, well, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=175.72s)]
*  we might have to make a decision. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=177.18s)]
*  If we have to make a decision, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=178.88s)]
*  I want to be able to give [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=180.16s)]
*  the president some options. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=181.04s)]
*  And part of the reason I tell you [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=182.56s)]
*  guys all that is, if you're [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=183.96s)]
*  independent or right winger, and [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=185.24s)]
*  you see stories like this and [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=186.84s)]
*  your initial reaction is always [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=188.04s)]
*  fake news, just calm down, okay? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=189.64s)]
*  It could be real and [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=192.76s)]
*  they keep Hegseth anyway, right? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=194.16s)]
*  Not everything is fake news and [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSbTpOmvvKI&t=196.72s)]
