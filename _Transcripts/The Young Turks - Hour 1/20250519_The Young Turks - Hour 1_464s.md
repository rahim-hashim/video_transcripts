"Elon Musk and Donald Trump were the main characters on the internet and across Washington day after day. Then the world‚Äôs richest man started to fade away.

On Truth Social, where Trump is known for sharing his unfiltered thoughts, the president used to mention Musk every few days but now has not posted about him in more than a month. Trump‚Äôs fundraising operation has largely ceased sending emails that name-check the Tesla CEO. The billionaire‚Äôs name, once a staple of White House briefings, now hardly gets mentioned at all. Even members of Congress have essentially dropped him from their newsletters."

TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

# Trump And Friends OFFICIALLY Turn On Elon
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [May 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ)
*  I'm gonna give you a trivia question, Cenk. There was a billionaire, early on in Trump's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=0.0s)]
*  second term, a really, really rich guy. You remember his name? Exactly, nobody has seen [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=5.64s)]
*  him, nobody remembers him. His name was Elon Musk, and he was a huge presence at the beginning [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=12.8s)]
*  of the Trump administration, which when I say at the beginning of the Trump administration, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=18.06s)]
*  it's a few months ago. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=22.2s)]
*  Trump went out of his way to associate with the Tesla CEO, and now Trump and his administration [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=23.86s)]
*  have completely abandoned his buddy. The data on how fast they dropped him from their messaging [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=29.16s)]
*  is remarkable, and we'll get to that shortly. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=35.44s)]
*  But first Cenk, why do you think we don't see Elon at all anymore? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=37.6s)]
*  I think there's two reasons. One is the polling that Michael's gonna tell you about, and Trump [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=42.88s)]
*  adjusts. I know some folks don't believe that, but he adjusts all the time. And the second [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=47.84s)]
*  reason is because Tesla stock is crashing, and he realized, right, that's where we make [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=53.980000000000004s)]
*  all my money. And so he just hurried back to that. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=59.28s)]
*  I think there's a third reason too, which is I got what I wanted from. I got a ton of [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=62.24s)]
*  money in the general election, and I don't need it anymore. I'm not running again, although [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=66.64s)]
*  he thinks he is. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=71.2s)]
*  And Elon might have gotten what he wanted too. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=72.2s)]
*  Of course he did, yeah. He got wealthy. I mean, Dogecoin, he was able to name a department, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=74.64s)]
*  the Doge Department, the Department of Government Efficiency, which coincidentally is the name [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=80.68s)]
*  of his coin. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=90.52000000000001s)]
*  It's like if I went into Bernie's cabinet and then we came up with a department called [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=91.52000000000001s)]
*  TYT. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=96.24000000000001s)]
*  Right, exactly. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=97.24000000000001s)]
*  And I'm like, whoa, whoa, whoa, what do you mean? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=98.24000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy. Anyway, Politico ran the numbers, Cenk, on how often Trump mentioned [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=100.24000000000001s)]
*  Elon Musk. I love this coverage in his truth social posts. And take a look at this data. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=105.47999999999999s)]
*  Trump has stopped posting about Musk now, but these are the numbers on this graph here. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=111.55999999999999s)]
*  As you can see, Elon came up most often in the months of February and March, just after [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=115.96s)]
*  the president was inaugurated. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=121.39999999999999s)]
*  But since April, Trump has not mentioned Elon Musk on a truth social post one single time. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=123.32s)]
*  The same pattern holds when you look at the posts from accounts affiliated with Trump, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=130.88s)]
*  like the White House and Trump War Room. So Trump-linked accounts are posting about [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=135.12s)]
*  Musk, as you see, less often there. Again, those accounts frequently mentioned Musk in [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=140.32s)]
*  February and March, but starting in April, you can look there, he was brought up far [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=146.08s)]
*  less often. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=150.12s)]
*  And if that wasn't enough data for you, Cenk, look at this one. In February, Trump's fundraising [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=151.08s)]
*  operation invoked Musk in emails to online supporters on a near daily basis, but mentions [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=158.08s)]
*  of Musk in fundraising appeals, and those haven't stopped, abruptly stopped in early [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=163.72s)]
*  March. Since then, Trump has sent only one fundraising message mentioning Musk, a May [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=168.76000000000002s)]
*  email touting a Gulf of America hat that the Tesla CEO had tried on. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=174.24s)]
*  So why is this the case? Well, as you mentioned before, there are reasons. Likely, one of [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=180.44s)]
*  them is that Musk has promised to prioritize Tesla over his government work. And that's [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=187.12s)]
*  because Tesla is tanking and been in a lot of trouble. And Musk's poll numbers themselves [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=193.4s)]
*  have been going down as well. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=199.56s)]
*  They've trailed Trump's. An anonymous GOP operative told Politico that, quote, he's [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=201.48000000000002s)]
*  finished, done, gone. He polls terrible. People hate him. He'd go to Wisconsin thinking he [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=206.36s)]
*  can buy people's votes, wear the cheese hat, act like a nine-year-old. It doesn't work. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=211.56s)]
*  It's offensive to people. And so what they're referring to there is Musk going up for that [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=216.32s)]
*  Supreme Court election in Wisconsin, a special election, and having no effect, the Republican [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=220.60000000000002s)]
*  lost there. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=225.64000000000001s)]
*  And if he can't have an effect in Wisconsin with all that spending, what good is he? Even [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=227.24s)]
*  Republican Senator Jim Justice of West Virginia admitted that Musk may have worn out his welcome. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=232.44s)]
*  He stated, we got too close to the fence. We mowed too far. I do like that. We just [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=238.06s)]
*  adjust. That's the process that's going on. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=245.24s)]
*  Justice also stated that Musk was a patriot trying to do good. Cenk? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=248.16s)]
*  Yeah, so the polling's bad. It's actually not as disastrous as I would have imagined. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=253.35999999999999s)]
*  He's got a 38 approval rating in the last poll that I saw, and 60% disapproval. So that [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=259.04s)]
*  sucks. That's 22 points underwater. But given how obnoxious he was, and how many jobs he [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=264.08s)]
*  cut of innocent people, I would have thought that it might be even lower in the 30s. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=270.15999999999997s)]
*  Well, but you come in with the MAGA 35 hard, right? And they're just gonna like anything [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=274.08000000000004s)]
*  that is associated with Trump. That's not to say that there was a huge MAGA showing [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=279.52000000000004s)]
*  in that poll. So I think 35 is always your bottom, your floor. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=284.02000000000004s)]
*  I think 28's your bottom. That's what I see in the polling for like, really, you can't [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=289.32s)]
*  believe that. That's really nuts. And 28% of Republicans are like, no, I believe it. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=295.52000000000004s)]
*  So anyways, or 28% of the country, unfortunately, which makes it a little bit higher percentage [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=301.47999999999996s)]
*  of Republicans. So, okay, now, yeah, he's a hard dog. Don't ask him if he's all right. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=306.59999999999997s)]
*  Tesla stock was totally crashing, and they had begun to look for a new CEO. And that's [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=313.15999999999997s)]
*  part of what set the panic out too. But now back to Wisconsin. Remember, Trump won Wisconsin. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=318.52s)]
*  It was by a small margin, but he won it. And they lost that Supreme Court seat by 10 points. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=324.03999999999996s)]
*  And that was Elon Musk going, hey, I'm here. I'm trying to win this seat. I'm trying to win this seat. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=330.84s)]
*  And people were like, vote against him, vote against him. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=335.47999999999996s)]
*  Right. So- Trying to buy votes too. I mean, literally. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=337.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, and in a swing state that's super important like Wisconsin, for Musk to cost you 10 points, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=340.76s)]
*  Yeah. That's a very bad perception. And Trump, remember, he's the guy who once he takes your [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=346.84s)]
*  money, he thinks, I don't owe you anything anymore, right? I already got your money, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=353.24s)]
*  you're a sucker. So here, presumably, Trump's not gonna run again. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=358.2s)]
*  So he's like, Elon, thanks for the $290 million. But if you're hurting my polling, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=363.4s)]
*  Goodbye. I'll see you later. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=369.4s)]
*  Yeah. Okay. And he values loyalty so much, does Trump. But he's the first to be disloyal, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=370.76s)]
*  which is amazing. So he will not stick by a failing, someone who's failing, their company [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=378.12s)]
*  is failing, not at all. And that's what you're seeing at play here too. Those numbers go down, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=382.92s)]
*  the company's failing. I wanna get as far away as I can. But if it was Musk who left him, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=387.56s)]
*  it would be an outrage. Yeah, and that's also like a Don, right? A mafia boss. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=392.2s)]
*  Yeah, of course. Right? Like, Tony, what's going on here? Right? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=397.88s)]
*  But on the other hand- I knew we'd get an imitation. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=402.36s)]
*  Of course, I am from Jersey. But he'd whack Tony in a second if he thought he could make a dime [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=404.76s)]
*  out of it, right? In that analogy. Okay, so look, last thing is, Democrats had already been planning [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=408.76s)]
*  to run all their elections based on Elon Musk. So now they're having to adjust. Guys, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=414.36s)]
*  stop with the bad guy on the other side. We're slightly worse. Well, 40 slip, no. Slightly [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=419.8s)]
*  better than the terrible guy is not a good strategy. Come up with a strategy where you say, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=426.36s)]
*  we're awesome. Look at these wonderful things we would do for you, the voters, and how it would [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=432.12s)]
*  affect your life. And then actually deliver. I know, it's really complicated. I just saw politics. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=436.76s)]
*  But unfortunately, the Democrats haven't. So they were hoping to run against Elon, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=443.24s)]
*  but now that he's gone, they're gonna have to come up with a new strategy. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM8mQy70SyQ&t=447.08s)]
