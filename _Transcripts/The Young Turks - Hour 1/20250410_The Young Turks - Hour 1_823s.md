# Tax Cut Bill Is Poised To EXPLODE The Deficit
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [April 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg)
*  No one has talked about cutting one benefit in Medicaid to anyone who's duly owed. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=0.0s)]
*  What we've talked about is returning work requirements. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=4.4s)]
*  So for example, you don't have able-bodied young men on a program that's designed for [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=7.0s)]
*  single mothers and the elderly and disabled. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=11.92s)]
*  They're draining resources from people who actually do that. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=14.16s)]
*  So if you clean that up and shore it up, you save a lot of money and you return the dignity [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=17.04s)]
*  of work to young men who need to be out working instead of playing video games all day. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=22.48s)]
*  We have a lot of fraud, waste and abuse in Medicaid. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=26.3s)]
*  Today, the House of Representatives have approved a blueprint for President Donald Trump's big, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=30.88s)]
*  beautiful bill. And that blueprint could very well include the dreaded cuts to Medicaid. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=37.36s)]
*  So you just watched House Speaker Mike Johnson's comments on that matter. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=42.16s)]
*  We have more details on the blueprint to get to, including how and why Republicans almost rebelled [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=46.24s)]
*  against it. But Cenk, there are a lot of young able-bodied men who work and earn money and still [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  rely on Medicaid. So what is Speaker Johnson talking about? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=57.52s)]
*  Yeah, so we're gonna get to the fight over Medicaid because there's actually some [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=60.64s)]
*  Republicans who don't wanna cut it. And there are others who wanna chop it to pieces and [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=63.36s)]
*  they're locked in a battle. But it doesn't matter cuz none of that's gonna happen because [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=67.92s)]
*  they're actually not going to cut spending almost at all. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=73.28s)]
*  That's my prediction and I'm gonna explain why in a second. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=78.08s)]
*  So when they cut $5 trillion in tax cuts, that's gonna be a $5 trillion hole in the [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=80.88s)]
*  deficit. The Republicans are going to be proven liars for the 800th time in a row. But in this new [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=86.96s)]
*  media age, I actually think there's some chance that people will begin to see [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=94.08s)]
*  that they're grotesque liars. They never cared about the deficit. They never cared about the debt. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=98.32s)]
*  I'm talking about Republican politicians. And yes, that definitely includes Donald J. Trump. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=105.11999999999999s)]
*  He's added to the debt more than any other president. And he's about to give the biggest [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=111.91999999999999s)]
*  giveaway to the rich and corporations that we have ever done in US history. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=116.24s)]
*  So let's give you the details when I come back and explain more. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=120.72s)]
*  All right, here are those details. The budget that the House passed [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=123.36s)]
*  clears the way for Congress to use the reconciliation process. And that means that [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=128.16s)]
*  conservatives get to ignore the Democrats' 60 vote Senate filibuster and pass a bill with a [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=132.56s)]
*  simple majority instead. So long as the House and the Senate work together on writing up Trump's [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=138.16s)]
*  quote, big beautiful bill. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=143.84s)]
*  But until this morning, several House Republicans did not trust their Senate counterparts. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=145.68s)]
*  And here is why, as we've covered many times on this show, the big beautiful bill [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=151.04s)]
*  would make our country take on a staggering amount of debt. Okay, it would cut taxes by $5.3 trillion [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=155.36s)]
*  over a decade. That's what Cenk keeps referring to. It would also raise the debt ceiling by $5 [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=163.36s)]
*  trillion. And the United States already has around $36 trillion in debt. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=168.32s)]
*  In February, the House passed a budget framework that committed to cutting $1.5 trillion in federal [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=174.48s)]
*  spending. But the Senate's budget, which passed last weekend, only committed to cutting $4 billion [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=180.79999999999998s)]
*  in federal spending. And the giant discrepancy of spending cuts is what Republicans were about [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=187.44s)]
*  to mutiny over. The House Freedom Caucus wanted the Senate to vote again on a different budget [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=193.68s)]
*  that committed to more cuts. They were afraid that if the Senate did not commit to spending [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=199.92000000000002s)]
*  cuts now, that the Senate would just get their way and only cut a few billion dollars of spending. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=204.8s)]
*  So to that end, Representative Andy Ogles said this. He said, I support the President. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=210.56s)]
*  I trust the President. I do not trust the Senate. I've seen this movie. I know how it ends. Why are [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=216.0s)]
*  we going down this path? It's like Lucy in the football. She pulls it away every time. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=221.92s)]
*  Mike Johnson wanted to vote on the budget yesterday, but he didn't have the votes. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=227.6s)]
*  But this morning, he put it up for a vote and it did pass. So what changed between then and now? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=232.0s)]
*  The Difference Maker was a press conference that Mike Johnson held and Senate Majority Leader John [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=237.11999999999998s)]
*  Thune was there as well this morning. Thune stated that many senators wanted to cut at least $1.5 [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=243.67999999999998s)]
*  trillion in spending, but there is nothing that will bind the Senate to actually do so. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=249.44s)]
*  In other words, the Republicans have decided to just take Thune at his word, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=254.96s)]
*  except for Thomas Massey and Victoria Sparks, two Republicans who voted no on the bill anyway. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=259.36s)]
*  Here's what Massey posted today. He said, if you were trying to hasten financial collapse of our [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=265.12s)]
*  country and bribe voters to go along with it, the strategy wouldn't look much different than what [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=271.28s)]
*  Congress is doing today. The big beautiful bill cuts taxes while keeping spending on an increasingly [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=276.4s)]
*  unstable trajectory. Instability really seems to be the theme these days. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=282.96s)]
*  As for Mike Johnson's comments on Medicaid, here's what you need to know about that. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=288.0s)]
*  The House's instructions include a directive to cut $880 billion from programs under the [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=292.4s)]
*  House Energy and Commerce Committee, which nonpartisan experts have said is not possible [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=298.32s)]
*  to meet without slashing Medicaid. Cenk, so more uncertainty, more unpredictability for [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=303.6s)]
*  the American people, it is exhausting and frankly, it's unacceptable, especially when you're doing all [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=309.92s)]
*  of these things, right? Making all of these cuts without providing any kind of contingency plan. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=314.96000000000004s)]
*  They have no consideration whatsoever for what to do with these people who have all by now lost [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=320.48s)]
*  their jobs, who won't have access to healthcare, who don't know whether or not they're gonna get [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=326.16s)]
*  their social security checks. There's too much uncertainty and they have no plan for what's gonna [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=332.24s)]
*  happen after they've burned everything down. Yeah, well, there's also too much certainty. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=336.88s)]
*  I'll explain what I mean by that. There's a mirror image of the Biden administration in here [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=343.12s)]
*  somewhere as well. So I'll get to it one by one. Now first, what happened to the parliamentarian? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=347.12s)]
*  I was told by the Democrats that you couldn't get anything done. Even the simplest things that [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=353.28000000000003s)]
*  the overwhelming majority of the country agrees to, 15-dollar minimum wage, paid family leave, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=357.04s)]
*  etc. Couldn't be done because of the all-powerful parliamentarian. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=361.12s)]
*  Now they're doing not tiny little things. They're doing $5 trillion in tax cuts. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=364.72s)]
*  Parliamentarian nowhere to be found. In case you didn't see it from an earlier show that we did, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=369.92s)]
*  the parliamentarian said they couldn't do this and the Republicans were like, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=374.08s)]
*  yeah, we don't care. You're irrelevant and they just moved on. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=377.28000000000003s)]
*  Exactly what we told the Democrats to do, but they pretended that they couldn't do that. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=381.36s)]
*  Number two, the spending cuts, you didn't miss here what you had said. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=385.52s)]
*  $4 billion, not trillion. So $5.3 trillion in tax cuts, $4 billion in spending cuts. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=391.76s)]
*  In that context, four is zero. Okay, so if you take away the $4 billion from $5.3 trillion, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=402.56s)]
*  you still have $5.3 trillion. Okay, that is unbelievable. Unbelievable, what a joke they are. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=408.4s)]
*  So look, this one, this one is bipartisan. In fact, Tom Massey is right. If you're a right-winger [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=415.2s)]
*  or you're conservative or you're MAGA, you should be way more pissed than we are about the spending [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=421.52s)]
*  cuts. They're not gonna do any spending cuts. That's the current blueprint in the House. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=427.28s)]
*  That's what just passed. Almost no spending cuts at all. Of course they're lying to you. Of course [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=433.03999999999996s)]
*  it's Lucy with the football. And in fact, that brings us to our parallel with Biden. Biden [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=441.2s)]
*  pretended that he was going to do all these progressive bills. And then they went with a [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=447.2s)]
*  strategy that they pushed onto the House for progressives to not fight the bill. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=453.52s)]
*  They said, yeah, your priorities, we eviscerated them. 85% of them are gone. And it's super obvious [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=459.76s)]
*  to anyone with a brain that they're not gonna come back. But don't worry, trust Biden. Because [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=466.48s)]
*  Biden is going to secretly, magically do these at another time. And did he? Of course he didn't. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=472.56s)]
*  Of course he didn't. So now, you know what they're calling this when it looks like they're not gonna [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=478.48s)]
*  do any spending cuts and all they're gonna do is put $5 trillion hole in the deficit? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=483.76s)]
*  They're calling it the trust Trump strategy. Mirror image, mirror image. You think you're [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=489.28000000000003s)]
*  gonna get spending cuts right wingers? The right wing base, you're not gonna get any spending cuts. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=494.88s)]
*  Even if all the spending cuts through Dojo are real, that's $130 billion. That leaves you [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=499.36s)]
*  $5.2 trillion in deficit hole. So even if everything they said was true, you'd still have [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=504.4s)]
*  almost no cuts. And you would do the giant giveaways for corporations and the richest people in America [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=512.32s)]
*  anyway. They're about to redistribute wealth from the middle to the top. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=518.88s)]
*  This is the greatest robbery. And in fact, that's part of the reason why we have all this tariff [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=524.8s)]
*  talk. So you don't notice while they rob you of $5.3 trillion. So that's why I've been harping [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=529.6s)]
*  on it nonstop. And because I don't want people to forget this because when we look back at the Trump [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=536.16s)]
*  administration, the one thing that everyone's gonna talk about is not the tariffs, is not [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=543.04s)]
*  anything that's happened so far. It's not gonna be Greenland. It's not gonna be Gulf of America. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=548.9599999999999s)]
*  It's going to be, my God, they gave away the biggest tax cut in history to the richest people [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=553.52s)]
*  in the history of the world. As if they didn't have enough, they gave them $5 trillion more [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=559.5999999999999s)]
*  from American taxpayers. The middle class eventually has to pay all this bill. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=564.64s)]
*  And how are they gonna pay it? They're gonna cut Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=569.28s)]
*  all that stuff is inevitable if they keep passing gigantic trillion dollar tax cuts [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=572.48s)]
*  for the richest people in the world. So that's what's headed next. So [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=577.76s)]
*  the thing that's certain is that the unit party and the donor class always win. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=582.16s)]
*  So Joe Biden told the donors nothing will fundamentally change. At least he was more [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=587.36s)]
*  honest about it. Everybody knew that Joe Biden was for the establishment and for the status quo. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=591.36s)]
*  Trump comes in like, I'm a populist, man. Average American, man, I hate these guys and that guys, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=596.32s)]
*  and I'm on your side. We're gonna go get the rich. He suckers, he suckers. I'm not gonna do [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=601.04s)]
*  any of that. I'm not gonna do this spending, cuz I'm not gonna do anything except give myself and [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=607.1999999999999s)]
*  all my rich friends literally trillions of dollars. This is not theoretical or hypothetical. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=611.04s)]
*  They just pass it in the House. It's the blueprint. Eventually they get to a point [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=617.28s)]
*  where they have to actually pass it in the House, the Senate, and the President has to sign it. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=621.5999999999999s)]
*  But in order for the bill to get derailed, the incredibly greedy, the incredibly corrupt [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=624.88s)]
*  unit party Republicans, which is 99% of them, are gonna say no to $5 trillion in tax cuts [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=631.6s)]
*  for their donors. I've got that at near zero chance. There would have to be some sort of [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=638.08s)]
*  actualist populist rebellion slash revolution to prevent these tax cuts from getting into place. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=644.16s)]
*  Because the one thing that always passes in Washington, they make a lot of promises to the [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=651.68s)]
*  left, a lot of promises to the right, a lot of promises to the middle. Those never happen. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=657.12s)]
*  The one thing that always happens is tax cuts for the rich and for corporations. So this train is [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=661.1999999999999s)]
*  headed 100 miles in our direction. And can there be a populist revolt in time to derail this? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=666.9599999999999s)]
*  Very, very, very unlikely. So you're about to get robbed on a scale we haven't seen in a long, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=672.9599999999999s)]
*  long time. This would be the largest tax cut in American history. And while everybody's distracted [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=679.76s)]
*  with the tariffs, they're just, just boom, they're getting it past everyone. And by the way, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=684.88s)]
*  mainstream media and the Democratic Party, are they going nuts over it? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=690.16s)]
*  Oh, they're getting, yeah, they are. They're getting ready now. Chuck Schumer, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=694.0s)]
*  Akim Jeffries are warming up going, there was nothing we could do. There was nothing we could [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=697.28s)]
*  do. There was nothing we could do. They're getting ready. They're getting ready to sing it, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=703.04s)]
*  because that's what's gonna happen. Yes. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=706.32s)]
*  Yeah, can't wait. I actually had to double check those numbers during the break before doing that [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=708.24s)]
*  story. The trillions versus the billions, because even me just reading it and presenting it, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=713.44s)]
*  I was like, what? The four billion. It's hard to wrap your head around. And I think you have to [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=718.8000000000001s)]
*  think that some of that is intentional, because as he said, all of this stuff is going on at the [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=724.1600000000001s)]
*  exact same time that we have all of this tariff chaos. And it's too much for the average person [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=728.88s)]
*  to keep up with. Even the person who is sitting here watching all these shows, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=734.32s)]
*  consuming all the news, reading all the articles, it is too much for anyone to deal with. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=738.32s)]
*  But it's what we were talking about. The American people are just being slapped one way or the other. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=743.6800000000001s)]
*  Nothing that's being done right now is intended to benefit the average American citizen, despite [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=749.44s)]
*  what they tell us. All of the smoke and mirrors, all of the fake reasons that they give us for [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=754.8000000000001s)]
*  why they're doing what they're doing is insulting, right? [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=759.6s)]
*  A big part of why Trump reversed his tariffs is because the market was taking so hard [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=762.8000000000001s)]
*  that it would have taken his tax cuts from him and his billionaire friends. But instead, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=767.52s)]
*  he gets up there and he tell us, people were getting a little bit yippy. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=771.52s)]
*  So I decided to do something different from the thing that I kept saying I was going to do, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=775.36s)]
*  not just for the last week, but since before he was the president for the second term. Even in [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=779.36s)]
*  his first term, he was talking about tariffs. The man is obsessed, right? And now he has made it [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=784.24s)]
*  all of our problems and here we are just having to deal with him. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=789.04s)]
*  And I know that we elected him a second time and I know that this is our fault, not my fault, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=792.7199999999999s)]
*  I didn't vote for him. But it is our collective fault that we all have to deal with this. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=798.3199999999999s)]
*  But it's difficult because you want to say, didn't you know what you were voting for? [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=802.9599999999999s)]
*  But at the same time, a lot of people, they don't hear everything because there's too much to hear [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=809.1999999999999s)]
*  and there's too much to keep track of. Every time you ring the bell below, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=814.16s)]
*  an angel gets his wings. Totally not true, but it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zhmo9Eollg&t=817.76s)]
