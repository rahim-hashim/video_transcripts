"President Donald Trump on Monday defended his threat to arrest Democratic California Governor Gavin Newsom, suggesting that his leadership failures amounted to a criminal offense.
Asked directly by a reporter what crime Newsom had committed, Trump responded, ‚ÄúI think his primary crime is running for governor because he‚Äôs done such a bad job.‚Äù*

# Trump Doubles Down on Newsom Threat
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI)
*  He's daring mom Holman to come and arrest him. Should he do it? I would do it if I was [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=0.0s)]
*  calm, I think it's great. I think his primary crime is running for governor [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=9.68s)]
*  because he's done such a bad job. What he's done to that state is like what Biden did to this country. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=14.88s)]
*  I mean, that last statement, I don't know if I disagree with it. But nonetheless, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=23.44s)]
*  that's Donald Trump threatening to arrest California Governor Gavin Newsom. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=28.32s)]
*  So while borders are Tom Homan sort of walked back his threat to arrest Gavin Newsom, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=34.16s)]
*  President Donald Trump clearly is striking a very different tone here. So this posturing war, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=41.2s)]
*  and that is what it is. It is a posturing war started with Homan's claim that anyone who impede [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=46.56s)]
*  obstructs immigration enforcement will get arrested and that includes [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=54.16s)]
*  elected politicians. That includes people like Gavin Newsom, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=59.2s)]
*  And I want you to hear more of what he had to say with his initial threat. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=66.56s)]
*  You've also mentioned Mayor Karen Bass and Governor Gavin Newsom. And there have been threats [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=70.4s)]
*  previously that if you stand in the way of your enforcement operations, you could be subject [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=77.03999999999999s)]
*  potentially to arrest. Are you saying that about Mayor Bass and Governor Newsom? Are they at risk [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=81.6s)]
*  of being arrested? I'll say about anybody. You cross that line. It's a felony to knowingly harbor and [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=86.8s)]
*  conceal on illegal alien. It's a felony to impede law enforcement from doing their job. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=91.91999999999999s)]
*  The Governor Newsom is an embarrassment for the state. He's the one that's feeding this mantra. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=96.16s)]
*  He supports sanctuary cities. He supports sanctuary laws. If he cared about public [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=102.47999999999999s)]
*  safety in the state of California, he would not have a sanctuary for criminals. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=108.0s)]
*  So in response to that, this is a video I showed you all yesterday, Newsom decided to basically [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=111.28s)]
*  use the situation to act like a tough guy and engage in his own posturing. Take a look at that. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=120.24s)]
*  Come after me, arrest me. Let's just get it over with. Tough guy. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=126.8s)]
*  I don't give a damn, but I care about my community. I care about this community. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=131.6s)]
*  The hell are they doing? These guys need to grow up. They need to stop. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=136.32s)]
*  And we need to push back. And I'm sorry to be so clear, but [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=140.88s)]
*  that kind of bloviating is exhausting. So Tom, arrest me. Let's go. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=144.4s)]
*  Look, I said this yesterday. I'm going to say it again. Yeah, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=150.72s)]
*  bloviating is super exhausting. That's all we get from our politicians. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=152.56s)]
*  And in this story in particular, a lot of bloviating. They can't stop with the bloviating. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=156.08s)]
*  So Newsom in that clip was bloviating. Okay, he's making himself out to be like some sort of [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=161.84s)]
*  warrior against the Trump administration. Big tough guy. This is probably the most frustrating [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=168.08s)]
*  part about how the White House impacts local politics here in California. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=173.2s)]
*  Because all of these failure, Democratic politicians who have done a poor job in [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=180.16s)]
*  governing this state get to position themselves as these big fighters against Donald Trump, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=186.4s)]
*  these big saviors. And it helps to deflect from how terrible their leadership has been in the [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=193.28s)]
*  state of California. And it's frustrating because look, Gavin Newsom is not your savior. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=199.84s)]
*  Okay, he's done a piss poor job in the state of California. And he would do an even worse job [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=204.24s)]
*  if he were to be elected as president of the United States, which he's currently campaigning [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=209.68s)]
*  for. That's why he's posturing right now as we speak. He knows that Homan's not gonna get [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=213.44s)]
*  him arrested. That's why he's saying what he's saying. But nonetheless, Homan actually walked [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=217.6s)]
*  back his threat following Newsom's statement, which was kind of surprising. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=224.16s)]
*  So let's take a quick look at that. On what grounds would you arrest Gavin Newsom? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=228.48s)]
*  Well, that whole thing's been taken out of context. They haven't crossed the line yet. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=233.92s)]
*  But like any other US citizen, if you cross that line, I don't care who they are, the governor, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=237.44s)]
*  the mayor, whatever. When you commit a crime against ICE officers, we will seek prosecution. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=242.0s)]
*  So this whole thing is just a bunch of noise, basically, because you're not claiming that [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=246.88s)]
*  Gavin Newsom has done anything to get to impede ICE officers. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=250.72s)]
*  Well, I'll leave that up to DOJ. But what I'm saying right now is when someone commits a crime, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=255.44s)]
*  we'll ask the Department of Justice to investigate and prosecute. So I'm not a prosecutor, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=260.32s)]
*  so we'll hand it over to DOJ. But right now, there's no intention to arrest the governor [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=264.88s)]
*  right now. I don't know if he crossed that line. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=270.88s)]
*  But you don't have any more evidence that he crossed the line than that I did. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=272.15999999999997s)]
*  No, I don't have evidence to cross the line at this point. What I simply said, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=275.68s)]
*  if and when he crosses that line, then we'll seek prosecution. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=279.2s)]
*  Okay, so in summation, there's just a lot of noise. Okay, so look, there you have Homan clarifying. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=285.2s)]
*  No one's getting arrested unless they commit a crime. Okay, but you know Donald Trump. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=294.64s)]
*  He's, A, the biggest troll in the country. So he's very likely trolling here. But it's honestly [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=300.88s)]
*  playing into what Newsom wants. He wants this ridiculous conversation to continue. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=309.76s)]
*  But here he is, here's what Trump has to say about this whole matter. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=314.4s)]
*  Gavin Newsom is, he's daring Tom Homan to come and arrest him. Did he do it? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=317.52s)]
*  I would do it if I was Tom. I think it's great. Gavin likes to publicity, but I think it would be [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=326.24s)]
*  a great thing. He's done a terrible job. Look, I like Gavin Newsom. He's a nice guy, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=332.56s)]
*  but he's grossly incompetent. Everybody knows. All you have to do is look at the little railroad [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=338.71999999999997s)]
*  he's building. It's about 100 times over budget. We're putting a flagpole over there. Under budget. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=343.36s)]
*  The little railroad comment was both accurate and hilarious, but the rest of it was ridiculous. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=354.24s)]
*  Arrest him for what? Believe me, no one would be more amused at Gavin Newsom getting arrested, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=360.08000000000004s)]
*  obviously legally arrested because he committed some sort of crime. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=368.16s)]
*  I would love it. I would be so happy. But he hasn't committed a crime that we know of. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=372.32s)]
*  It's like, what are we doing? What are we doing? Why are we doing this? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=376.47999999999996s)]
*  Why are we doing this? This is such a waste of time. I get it. Why are you talking about it [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=379.44s)]
*  if it's a waste of time? Because I want you all to understand that our politicians don't give a [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=384.4s)]
*  damn about us, okay? They don't give a damn about us at all. They're not looking for solutions. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=389.44s)]
*  If I were Gavin Newsom, rather than publicly engaging in this complete s show, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=395.03999999999996s)]
*  right? Knowing full well you're not gonna get arrested homeboy. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=400.72s)]
*  I would do anything and everything in my power. Yes, I get it. People are gonna be repulsed by [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=405.44000000000005s)]
*  this, but I would reach out to the Trump administration and try to have a conversation [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=410.72s)]
*  about how we cool the temperature. What can we do to work together to, yes, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=416.64000000000004s)]
*  respond effectively to the rioters without scaring people, without deploying active duty [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=422.88s)]
*  Marines. But that's what a leader would do. A leader would be willing to put their ego aside [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=430.40000000000003s)]
*  and understand, yeah, that's right. I got elected to serve the people of California. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=436.8s)]
*  I didn't get elected to use my time as a public servant to engage in, honestly, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=442.24s)]
*  presidential campaigning and ridiculous posturing. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=449.68s)]
*  And yeah, I get that I'm being harsher on Newsom than I am on Trump, who's created part of this [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=454.24s)]
*  mess to begin with. But I have no standards for the Trump administration at this point. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=459.28000000000003s)]
*  So I'm not expecting Trump to be the one to lower the temperature. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=464.96s)]
*  And sometimes you gotta be the bigger person as the Democratic governor of California [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=470.48s)]
*  to tuck tail, hit up the White House and be like, listen, we need to handle this situation like [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=475.2s)]
*  adults and we need to do what's right for the people of LA and for the country. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=482.32s)]
*  I really don't want to deploy active duty military, but I also don't want these riots to take place. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=488.48s)]
*  So what can we do to work together? But we're not gonna ever get that. Instead, we're gonna have [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=494.56s)]
*  this pathetic political theater. Newsom then took to X to write that the President of the United [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=499.92s)]
*  States just called for the arrest of a sitting governor. This is a day I hoped I would never see [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=506.96s)]
*  in America. I don't care if you're a Democrat or Republican, this is a line we cannot cross as a [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=512.88s)]
*  bro. Listen, Newsom didn't commit any crime, so arresting him would be ridiculous. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=519.12s)]
*  But they clarified and said, we're not gonna arrest him because he hasn't committed a crime. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=525.2s)]
*  Now, if an elected lawmaker, if a governor, a mayor, a president commits a crime, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=531.44s)]
*  I'm sure Gavin Newsom agrees with that individual's arrest, right? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=538.8000000000001s)]
*  Because I remember he did when Trump was indicted. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=543.6s)]
*  No one's above the law. And you know what? I believe that as well. Now, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=549.5200000000001s)]
*  Newsom hasn't committed a crime, so I'm not worried about him getting arrested. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=553.04s)]
*  He's not worried about himself getting arrested. But come on, it's just amazing to me how we're now [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=555.68s)]
*  dealing with Democrats who are pretending like it's unacceptable to arrest an elected politician. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=562.48s)]
*  Okay, and then Newsom is leaning into this heavily saying that Alabama has three times the homicide [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=569.1999999999999s)]
*  rate of California. Its murder rate is ranked third in the entire country. Stick to football, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=577.2s)]
*  bro. And he's essentially referring to Tommy Tuberville who called for Gavin Newsom to be [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=583.36s)]
*  arrested. He says, lock him up. Anyway, this is pathetic. All of these people are acting like [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=587.84s)]
*  children. And in the meantime, people's lives are at stake. And I mean that. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=593.5200000000001s)]
*  Okay, we're talking about this effort at mass deportation. We don't know who's being detained. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=599.2s)]
*  We don't know who's being deported. Obviously, the administration has made mistakes in the past, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=604.96s)]
*  administrative errors as they were referred to and wrongfully deporting people. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=611.9200000000001s)]
*  So can we focus on that, Newsom? Maybe focus on that a little bit. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=616.72s)]
*  Now update on this lawsuit. As I mentioned earlier, Gavin Newsom did file a lawsuit [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=621.9200000000001s)]
*  against the Trump administration in order to block the use or deployment of National Guard troops [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=627.6s)]
*  and Marines. A federal judge has already waited on that and denied the request, at least temporarily [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=633.68s)]
*  denied the request. There's no indication that the deployment of National Guard troops to protect [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=639.8399999999999s)]
*  federal agents and federal property is in any way unconstitutional or illegal. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=646.16s)]
*  But the deployment of active duty Marines, that's really a big question. Whether or not [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=651.04s)]
*  that flies in the face of federal laws, whether or not that's unconstitutional. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=658.0799999999999s)]
*  And so we'll see what the next step by Newsom will be given that a federal judge has waited on this [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=662.4s)]
*  and decided to temporarily reject this emergency request. But yeah, this is a total clown show. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=668.24s)]
*  It absolutely is. There are no good actors in this story at all, and it's just absolutely [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=677.92s)]
*  pathetic. The only good actors are the peaceful demonstrators who are totally being buried in the [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=683.28s)]
*  story because the rioters are grabbing all the attention. These politicians are grabbing [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=688.56s)]
*  all the attention and the important message coming from the peaceful demonstrators is just [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=693.1199999999999s)]
*  totally being buried under a pile of garbage. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IocKA3gDRI&t=697.1199999999999s)]
