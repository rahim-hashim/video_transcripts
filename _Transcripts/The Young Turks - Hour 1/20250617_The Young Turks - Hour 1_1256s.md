"The war of words between America First isolationists and the pro-Israel interventionists is ramping up to new and dangerous levels of invective for former partisan allies.
To wit: former Trump advisor and populist MAGA leader Steve Bannon just went OFF on Fox News in a manner that cannot be pleasing to the pro-Trump opinion hosts at the right-of-center cable news network."

TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.
The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.
On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.
Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.
Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.
TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.
TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.

# MAGA Goes To WAR With Fox News
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0)
*  There's an awful lot of people I [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=0.0s)]
*  notice right now saying how they're [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=2.0s)]
*  true MAGA and they're pure MAGA. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=4.2s)]
*  I don't think anybody at Fox can [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=6.42s)]
*  possibly be true MAGA and [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=8.58s)]
*  hardcore MAGA. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=10.24s)]
*  And the reason is, to be brutally [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=11.38s)]
*  frank, when President Trump had [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=13.38s)]
*  the election stolen from him and [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=15.42s)]
*  had the White House taken away. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=17.32s)]
*  Because everybody at Fox takes [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=19.34s)]
*  a paycheck from Murdoch, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=20.94s)]
*  you all supported DeSantis and [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=22.26s)]
*  Nikki Haley and whoever else came [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=23.82s)]
*  along, right, as a opportunity to [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=25.66s)]
*  replace President Trump and [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=27.66s)]
*  replace President Trump. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=29.26s)]
*  So if you work at Fox by definition, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=30.220000000000002s)]
*  you can't be true MAGA, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=32.300000000000004s)]
*  it's impossible. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=33.5s)]
*  Well, as Cenk said, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=34.58s)]
*  they're all full of crap. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=36.120000000000005s)]
*  The Republican Civil War has reached [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=38.1s)]
*  the point where right wingers are [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=40.38s)]
*  now attacking Fox News. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=42.38s)]
*  On multiple occasions this week, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=44.18s)]
*  Steve Bannon called out the [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=46.18000000000001s)]
*  conservative network and even went [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  so far as to claim that if you work [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=49.78s)]
*  there, you can't be true MAGA. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=51.72s)]
*  Here's another moment from just [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=53.660000000000004s)]
*  a few days ago. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=55.56s)]
*  Here's another moment from just [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=56.379999999999995s)]
*  a few days ago. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=58.04s)]
*  I don't hear, we got American [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=60.22s)]
*  troops in Iraq. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=61.64s)]
*  Why we got American troops in Iraq [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=62.58s)]
*  because Fox News and [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=64.66s)]
*  all of them and Bush lied to us, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=65.97999999999999s)]
*  lied. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=67.97999999999999s)]
*  This was not a failure of [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=69.2s)]
*  intelligence or [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=71.38s)]
*  we made some bad calculations, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=72.74s)]
*  it was bald face lies. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=75.56s)]
*  So we're going to go a little bit [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=77.53999999999999s)]
*  deeper into the war within Trump's [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=80.02s)]
*  base and [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=83.02s)]
*  we've seen hints of this in the [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=84.26s)]
*  past where they would attack Fox [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=86.78s)]
*  News or just things that were set [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=89.4s)]
*  on Fox News, certain anchors or [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=92.14s)]
*  whatever different hosts. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=94.68s)]
*  But we've never really seen [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=97.10000000000001s)]
*  anything quite to this extent. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=98.52000000000001s)]
*  So are you surprised that we're [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=100.02000000000001s)]
*  seeing them completely just turn [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=101.58000000000001s)]
*  their backs on Fox News? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=103.14s)]
*  Because it's almost like, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=104.42s)]
*  where are they going to get their [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=105.82000000000001s)]
*  news from? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=107.18s)]
*  Yeah, well, that's the state of [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=108.30000000000001s)]
*  affairs now that is so interesting. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=110.10000000000001s)]
*  They are not getting their news [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=112.18s)]
*  from Fox News as much as they used [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=113.98s)]
*  to. Now there's tons of people [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=115.53999999999999s)]
*  still watch Fox News and that's why [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=117.02s)]
*  people online refer to like boomer [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=118.94s)]
*  neocons that got brainwashed by Fox [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=121.0s)]
*  News because where I disagree with [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=123.14s)]
*  Steve Bannon on a ton of things [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=125.52s)]
*  including that the 2020 election [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=127.52s)]
*  was stolen, no it wasn't, okay? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=129.74s)]
*  So there's a plenty to this because [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=132.06s)]
*  we're on different sides. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=133.98s)]
*  That's why I don't agree with [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=135.57999999999998s)]
*  Steve Bannon on that. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=137.02s)]
*  But he's now telling his audience [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=138.1s)]
*  the truth about Fox News. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=140.1s)]
*  It's because they're now political [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=142.29999999999998s)]
*  opponents, right? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=144.7s)]
*  Bannon doesn't want to go into [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=147.18s)]
*  Iran and Fox News definitely wants [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=149.02s)]
*  to start another war. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=151.12s)]
*  But in the midst of this fight, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=152.62s)]
*  they're beginning to spill the tea [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=154.22s)]
*  about each other. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=156.1s)]
*  And Bannon is absolutely correct [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=157.18s)]
*  that Fox News lied us into Iraq war. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=159.1s)]
*  One of the top people who did that [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=161.66s)]
*  was Sean Hannity. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=163.26s)]
*  So you're going to see here they're [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=164.38s)]
*  an open warfare against each other. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=166.1s)]
*  So Tucker Carlson also hit Sean [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=167.94s)]
*  Hannity saying along similar lines. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=169.82s)]
*  You guys have started wars before, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=172.38s)]
*  you want to start wars now? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=174.14000000000001s)]
*  And so I love that they're [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=175.82s)]
*  an open revolt. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=177.66s)]
*  And I think that you have to give [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=179.1s)]
*  credit where credit is due, not [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=181.2s)]
*  that they're right about [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=183.3s)]
*  everything guys just agreeing on [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=185.02s)]
*  one thing or giving one piece of [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=187.3s)]
*  credit honestly does not mean you [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=189.46s)]
*  agree with everything they say, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=191.7s)]
*  please, please, just this is not [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=194.22s)]
*  that hard to figure out, okay? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=196.66s)]
*  Can you agree with Steve Bannon [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=198.98000000000002s)]
*  that Fox News lied right wingers [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=200.86s)]
*  into the war with Iraq? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=202.86s)]
*  Of course they did, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=204.94s)]
*  of course that's true. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=206.1s)]
*  And are they trying to line them [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=207.70000000000002s)]
*  into the war in Iran? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=209.34s)]
*  Absolutely, Rupert Murdoch is [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=210.58s)]
*  the biggest warmonger of my [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=213.34s)]
*  lifetime. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=215.58s)]
*  There is an award that he hasn't [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=217.08s)]
*  wanted to snuggle with and [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=219.1s)]
*  make out with and [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=220.8s)]
*  push on to the American people and [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=221.9s)]
*  make us fight it, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=224.1s)]
*  make us pay for it. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=225.22s)]
*  So the fact that they're taking on [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=226.62s)]
*  Fox News is awesome news. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=228.58s)]
*  And yes, you're going to see it in [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=230.7s)]
*  the comments that she's going to [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=232.42s)]
*  read for you guys from other [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=234.1s)]
*  maga, etc. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=235.5s)]
*  It's in the beginning, they don't [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=237.18s)]
*  want to take on Daddy Trump, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=239.22s)]
*  because they're worried that [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=240.74s)]
*  everybody on their side likes Trump. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=242.34s)]
*  And strategically, they're not [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=244.42s)]
*  wrong from their point of view on [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=246.46s)]
*  their side, because they're trying [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=248.42000000000002s)]
*  to win Trump over to their side. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=250.62s)]
*  And if they insult him even [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=252.62s)]
*  a tiny bit, you know how [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=254.06s)]
*  thin skin he is, no, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=255.34s)]
*  they hurt my feelings. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=256.54s)]
*  I'm going with the neocots, right? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=258.3s)]
*  Yeah, he'll do that until [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=260.22s)]
*  those pollings in the 20s. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=261.34s)]
*  Anyways, so that's why instead of [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=263.42s)]
*  directly attacking Trump, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=265.62s)]
*  they're attacking one another. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=267.4s)]
*  And they're attacking Fox News, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=269.46s)]
*  and they're going to war internally [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=271.34000000000003s)]
*  and trying to win Trump over to [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=273.34000000000003s)]
*  their side. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=274.98s)]
*  Yeah, it all feels very passive, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=276.86s)]
*  aggressive, and a strange way for [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=278.54s)]
*  them to achieve whatever goals [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=280.18s)]
*  they're actually after. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=281.7s)]
*  I also love that you mentioned [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=283.18s)]
*  the war in Iraq, but [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=284.5s)]
*  let me not get too far ahead of [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=285.38s)]
*  myself. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=286.7s)]
*  Let me get to the story first, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=287.34000000000003s)]
*  then we'll get to that. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=288.82000000000005s)]
*  So in addition to attacking Fox [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=289.86s)]
*  News, Steve Bannon is putting out [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=291.94000000000005s)]
*  a dire warning. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=294.22s)]
*  In an interview with Tucker [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=295.54s)]
*  Carlson, he and Tucker were careful [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=297.02000000000004s)]
*  to put most of the blame for [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=299.1s)]
*  Trump's foreign policy decisions on [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=300.64000000000004s)]
*  the Warhawks surrounding him, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=302.86s)]
*  rather than Trump himself. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=304.70000000000005s)]
*  But they did say that getting [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=306.90000000000003s)]
*  involved in another foreign war [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=308.5s)]
*  would break up Trump's coalition. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=310.3s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=312.14000000000004s)]
*  Donald J Trump gets elected in [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=314.22s)]
*  the back of this amazing coalition, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=316.78s)]
*  unprecedented coalition. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=318.78s)]
*  But this coalition, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=320.18s)]
*  which you described earlier and [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=321.62s)]
*  more precisely than anybody by far, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=323.9s)]
*  is the defining fact of American [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=326.41999999999996s)]
*  politics, and it kind of feels like [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=328.74s)]
*  it's being blown up over this war [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=331.06s)]
*  in Iran. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=333.29999999999995s)]
*  And I'm a big supporter of Israel. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=334.06s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=337.09999999999997s)]
*  And I'm telling people, hey, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=337.62s)]
*  if we get sucked into this war, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=339.38s)]
*  which inexorably looks like it's [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=341.21999999999997s)]
*  going to happen on the combat side, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=343.21999999999997s)]
*  it's not just blow up the coalition. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=345.38s)]
*  It's also going to thwart what [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=347.73999999999995s)]
*  we're doing with the most [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=349.17999999999995s)]
*  important thing, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=350.46s)]
*  which is the deportation of [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=351.5s)]
*  the illegal alien invaders that [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=352.85999999999996s)]
*  are here. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=354.38s)]
*  Well, Donald Trump, for his part, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=358.09999999999997s)]
*  as you can imagine, is not too [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=360.17999999999995s)]
*  happy that his former friend and [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=361.94s)]
*  ally, Tucker Carlson, is calling [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=363.85999999999996s)]
*  him out publicly. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=365.85999999999996s)]
*  So here's how Trump responded to [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=366.85999999999996s)]
*  a reporter's question about [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=368.82s)]
*  Tucker yesterday. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=370.55999999999995s)]
*  What is your response to [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=372.62s)]
*  Tucker Carlson criticizing you, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=373.7s)]
*  saying that you're [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=375.3s)]
*  complicit in the war? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=376.22s)]
*  I don't know what Tucker Carlson [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=378.34000000000003s)]
*  is saying. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=379.74s)]
*  Let him go get a television network [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=380.26s)]
*  and say it so that people listen. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=381.98s)]
*  And quickly, have you spoken? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=383.78000000000003s)]
*  And on True Social last night, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=387.54s)]
*  he posted this. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=389.26s)]
*  Somebody please explain to kooky [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=390.7s)]
*  Tucker Carlson that Iran cannot [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=392.82s)]
*  have a nuclear weapon. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=395.34000000000003s)]
*  But you might be surprised at who [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=397.5s)]
*  took Tucker's side in this fight. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=399.42s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor Greene, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=401.3s)]
*  typically one of the biggest Trump [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=402.78000000000003s)]
*  bootlickers there is, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=404.74s)]
*  responded to Trump on X. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=406.06s)]
*  She had a lot to say. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=407.98s)]
*  She said, Tucker Carlson is one of [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=408.82s)]
*  my favorite people. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=410.58s)]
*  He fiercely loves his wife, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=411.78000000000003s)]
*  children, and our country. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=413.3s)]
*  Since being fired by the Neocon [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=415.06s)]
*  network, Fox News, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=417.02000000000004s)]
*  he has more popularity and [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=418.38s)]
*  viewers than ever before. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=420.06s)]
*  He unapologetically believes [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=421.98s)]
*  the same things I do, that if we [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=423.94s)]
*  don't fight for our country and [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=425.90000000000003s)]
*  our own people, then we will no [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=427.90000000000003s)]
*  longer have a country for our [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=429.90000000000003s)]
*  children and our grandchildren. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=431.46000000000004s)]
*  And foreign wars, intervention, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=433.58000000000004s)]
*  regime change, put America last, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=435.90000000000003s)]
*  kill innocent people, are making us [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=438.14s)]
*  broke and will ultimately lead to [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=440.38s)]
*  our destruction. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=442.34000000000003s)]
*  That's not kooky. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=443.46000000000004s)]
*  That's what millions of Americans [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=444.46000000000004s)]
*  voted for. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=446.46000000000004s)]
*  It's what we believe is America [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=447.06s)]
*  first. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=448.62s)]
*  So Candace Owens responded to [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=451.02000000000004s)]
*  Trump's attack on Tucker with this. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=452.74s)]
*  She said Donald Trump just [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=454.86s)]
*  completely fractured his base. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=456.46000000000004s)]
*  And he did it for the very [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=458.5s)]
*  Neocons who minted the never Trump [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=460.18s)]
*  movement, truly unbelievable. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=462.46s)]
*  And of course, Alex Jones backed [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=464.5s)]
*  him up saying, I am proud that [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=466.54s)]
*  Tucker Carlson is standing his [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=468.38s)]
*  ground against the psychotic [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=470.38s)]
*  warmongering Neocons that have [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=472.38s)]
*  brought the world to the verge of [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=474.54s)]
*  thermal nuclear Armageddon. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=476.66s)]
*  So what we're witnessing here is [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=479.02s)]
*  imperialism and Israel is simply [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=481.18s)]
*  following the American example, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=483.42s)]

*  against them, which is literally [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=501.42s)]
*  what's happening right now with [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=503.26s)]
*  Israel and Iran. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=505.06s)]
*  And a significant portion of [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=505.94s)]
*  the American people supported it at [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=507.42s)]
*  the time because honestly, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=509.38s)]
*  we didn't know any better. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=510.86s)]
*  And I know that's a bit of [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=512.38s)]
*  an oversimplification of the mood [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=513.62s)]
*  of that time, but it's essentially [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=515.3s)]
*  what it boiled down to. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=517.06s)]
*  And the Israelis who see themselves [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=518.42s)]
*  still as victims in all of this, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=520.3s)]
*  according to reports at least, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=522.02s)]
*  they support what their government [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=523.76s)]
*  is doing in Iran. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=525.64s)]
*  Meanwhile Netanyahu is making [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=526.5s)]
*  an absolute fool out of Donald [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=528.2199999999999s)]
*  Trump, which would be hilarious if [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=529.78s)]
*  it wasn't actually so [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=531.78s)]
*  dangerous and deadly. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=533.06s)]
*  But Americans do not want to get [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=534.78s)]
*  involved with any of this. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=536.54s)]
*  That's what Marjorie Taylor Greene [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=538.14s)]
*  was referencing. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=539.8599999999999s)]
*  This is not what Trump voters [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=540.9799999999999s)]
*  actually voted for. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=542.54s)]
*  They voted for a no war president. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=543.54s)]
*  So seeing him on the verge of [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=545.82s)]
*  engaging in Iran is very troubling [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=547.5200000000001s)]
*  for a lot of them and it should be. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=549.6600000000001s)]
*  And seeing these debates happening [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=551.7800000000001s)]
*  within right wing media is sort of [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=553.82s)]
*  encouraging because we're so used [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=555.62s)]
*  to Fox News viewers only ever [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=557.58s)]
*  getting one side of a story. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=559.3000000000001s)]
*  Or only getting the Trump approved [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=561.58s)]
*  perspective or the messaging. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=563.7s)]
*  It would be nice if these [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=565.94s)]
*  conversations actually had some [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=566.94s)]
*  bearing on the administration and [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=568.34s)]
*  the way that it proceeds. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=569.9000000000001s)]
*  But Trump, honestly, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=571.0200000000001s)]
*  he's just going to do whatever [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=572.1400000000001s)]
*  makes him look and feel the most [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=573.7800000000001s)]
*  powerful. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=575.46s)]
*  So what do you think Cenk? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=576.3000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, in the first hour, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=577.7s)]
*  I explained how Trump had Rubio put [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=579.5s)]
*  out the statement saying we were [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=581.86s)]
*  not involved in the attack on [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=583.96s)]
*  the first night because he didn't [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=585.7s)]
*  know how it was going to go. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=587.6600000000001s)]
*  But the next morning when he was [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=589.34s)]
*  watching Fox News, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=591.5s)]
*  they made it sound like it was such [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=592.86s)]
*  a strong and brilliant maneuver by [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=595.14s)]
*  Israel. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=597.7s)]
*  And they kept complimenting what [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=599.4200000000001s)]
*  the genius of the Israeli military. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=601.3000000000001s)]
*  That's why Bannon and Tucker and [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=604.1s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor Greene, etc. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=605.8199999999999s)]
*  are telling you not to watch [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=607.42s)]
*  Fox News. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=608.6999999999999s)]
*  That was a propaganda trick [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=609.3s)]
*  designed to appeal to one man, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=611.06s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=612.9399999999999s)]
*  And it totally worked. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=614.1s)]
*  So Trump, according to the New York [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=616.54s)]
*  Times reporting from inside sources [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=618.22s)]
*  in the White House, then was like, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=619.9399999999999s)]
*  yeah, it's strong and brilliant. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=621.78s)]
*  I did that, it was me, it's me. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=624.98s)]
*  And then he came out and [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=626.62s)]
*  started to take ownership over it. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=627.9399999999999s)]
*  We control the skies and [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=630.02s)]
*  you never know what we're going to [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=631.06s)]
*  do and they didn't come to [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=632.54s)]
*  the negotiating table. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=633.8199999999999s)]
*  And that's why we did this. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=635.0999999999999s)]
*  And today he's been all we, we, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=636.9s)]
*  we have the best weapons and [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=639.06s)]
*  sources and that's why we use [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=640.98s)]
*  intelligence against Iran. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=642.9399999999999s)]
*  And we knocked out their ability to [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=644.86s)]
*  defend themselves. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=647.26s)]
*  So he's now bragging that we not [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=649.3399999999999s)]
*  only help Israel defend themselves, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=651.18s)]
*  but also went on the offense [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=653.4599999999999s)]
*  against Iran. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=655.06s)]
*  Because Fox News was like, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=656.0999999999999s)]
*  whoever did this is a genius and [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=658.0999999999999s)]
*  strong. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=660.0999999999999s)]
*  Okay, that's me, that's me. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=661.02s)]
*  God, what a fool, so [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=663.42s)]
*  easy to manipulate. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=665.02s)]
*  So now look, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=666.62s)]
*  you talked about the Iraq war. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=667.5s)]
*  And at the time, yeah, that's true, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=669.74s)]
*  not a lot of Americans saw that [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=671.62s)]
*  coming, but they were lied to. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=673.1s)]
*  So mainstream media, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=675.2199999999999s)]
*  including Fox News, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=676.42s)]
*  Fox News is part of mainstream [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=677.5s)]
*  media, overwhelmingly told them to [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=679.06s)]
*  lie over and over and over again [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=681.5s)]
*  that Iraq had something to do with [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=683.5s)]
*  9-11, Iraq had nothing to do with [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=685.78s)]
*  9-11, and they were like, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=688.06s)]
*  what do you do with 9-11? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=690.06s)]
*  Iraq was opposed to al-Qaeda. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=691.4599999999999s)]
*  Instead, they did this racist thing [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=693.78s)]
*  of Muslim, Muslim, same thing, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=695.6199999999999s)]
*  right? [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=697.42s)]
*  No, two sets of Muslims fighting [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=698.18s)]
*  against each other all the time. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=700.0999999999999s)]
*  Al-Qaeda wanted to topple Saddam's [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=702.26s)]
*  government, so that was a bad guy. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=703.9799999999999s)]
*  But he had absolutely nothing to [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=705.9399999999999s)]
*  do with al-Qaeda other than killing [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=707.18s)]
*  them every once in a while, right? [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=708.5s)]
*  So 69% of Americans on the day we [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=710.2199999999999s)]
*  went to war in Iraq thought Saddam [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=712.6199999999999s)]
*  had personally attacked us on 9-11. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=715.18s)]
*  That's part of how we got [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=718.86s)]
*  lied into that war. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=719.82s)]
*  And then of course there was [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=721.1s)]
*  a story about, my God, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=722.22s)]
*  Iraq has weapons of mass [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=723.3000000000001s)]
*  destruction. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=724.5s)]
*  We better act before the evidence [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=727.1400000000001s)]
*  comes in in the form of a mushroom [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=729.0600000000001s)]
*  cloud over an American city. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=730.82s)]
*  That's what they said to us, right? [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=733.3800000000001s)]
*  And now what are they saying [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=735.22s)]
*  about Iran? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=736.22s)]
*  Iran has nuclear weapons, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=736.94s)]
*  they're about to, they're about to [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=739.1400000000001s)]
*  weapons of mass destruction. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=741.1800000000001s)]
*  And Fox News is printing that lie [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=742.82s)]
*  over and over and over again. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=744.5400000000001s)]
*  Gigantic liars, right? [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=746.62s)]
*  Netanyahu, although to be fair, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=748.98s)]
*  the one time he got caught was on [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=750.74s)]
*  Fox News, super ironically, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=752.38s)]
*  I'll give Brett Breyer, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=753.9000000000001s)]
*  I always give credit where credit [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=755.0200000000001s)]
*  is due. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=756.38s)]
*  And Breyer asked him about it, and [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=756.94s)]
*  Netanyahu said, because Breyer said, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=758.6600000000001s)]
*  wait, US intelligence says they [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=760.5s)]
*  don't even have a nuclear weapons [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=761.98s)]
*  program. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=763.62s)]
*  They stopped it back in 2003, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=764.4200000000001s)]
*  they have never reconstituted it. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=766.5s)]
*  The Grand Aitole is opposed to it. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=768.7800000000001s)]
*  And then Netanyahu goes, yeah, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=771.5400000000001s)]
*  I mean, they could have a weapon [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=773.22s)]
*  within a year. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=775.02s)]
*  What happened to any week now, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=777.9s)]
*  any day now, and I had to go, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=779.5s)]
*  right? [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=781.06s)]
*  And of course, Netanyahu is [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=781.9399999999999s)]
*  a giant liar, and he's been saying [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=783.38s)]
*  that Iran was about to have a nuke [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=785.42s)]
*  since 1995. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=787.42s)]
*  But there were shows on the air [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=789.14s)]
*  that were opposed to the Iraq war [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=790.8199999999999s)]
*  and did see through the lies, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=792.5s)]
*  two of them. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=794.18s)]
*  One was Democracy Now, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=795.9s)]
*  national shows, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=797.6999999999999s)]
*  there's local shows too, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=798.9s)]
*  a couple of those, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=800.5799999999999s)]
*  about a handful of those. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=801.6999999999999s)]
*  At the national level, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=803.3s)]
*  there was Democracy Now with [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=804.18s)]
*  Amy Goodman, who's a hero for that, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=805.46s)]
*  and the Young Turks. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=807.38s)]
*  So we've been around for [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=809.22s)]
*  23 years, oldest show in [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=810.8199999999999s)]
*  Internet history, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=812.52s)]
*  first YouTube partner ever. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=813.8199999999999s)]
*  And we were on the air, and [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=815.78s)]
*  Ben Mangus and I were at the time [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=817.34s)]
*  going, no, don't go in, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=819.3s)]
*  just like we are today. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=820.9s)]
*  Don't go in, it's a trap, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=822.46s)]
*  don't go in, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=824.66s)]
*  it has nothing to do with us. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=825.8199999999999s)]
*  So some people saw it, but [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=828.02s)]
*  a lot of people got lied to in [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=829.22s)]
*  the war. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=830.46s)]
*  So look, guys, we do see things [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=831.14s)]
*  from time to time before others do. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=832.9000000000001s)]
*  I'll tell you why in a minute, but [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=835.5s)]
*  first I want to give you an example [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=836.98s)]
*  of what I saw apparently a little [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=838.74s)]
*  bit earlier than others. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=840.34s)]
*  So I was on David Pakman's show, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=842.38s)]
*  we'll run the full clip for [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=844.1s)]
*  you guys. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=845.34s)]
*  And this was before inauguration, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=845.86s)]
*  so before Trump even got into [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=848.46s)]
*  office, and [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=850.5400000000001s)]
*  here's what I told David Pak. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=851.5400000000001s)]
*  Look, this is where I think [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=853.86s)]
*  the rubber hits the road, and [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=855.5400000000001s)]
*  this is now I'm really out on a [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=857.34s)]
*  limb, okay? [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=859.08s)]
*  Okay. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=860.34s)]
*  I think his base is going to turn [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=860.94s)]
*  on Israel. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=862.42s)]
*  And so when he goes, yeah, no, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=863.38s)]
*  I'm going to give Israel another [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=865.86s)]
*  $30 billion and I'm going to help [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=868.5s)]
*  them bomb more countries. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=871.0999999999999s)]
*  At some point, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=873.18s)]
*  MAGA is going to go, no, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=873.9s)]
*  that's enough, brother, man. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=874.9799999999999s)]
*  That's enough. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=876.26s)]
*  We said America first, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=877.3s)]
*  not Israel first. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=878.26s)]
*  And so I think they're going to [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=879.74s)]
*  turn on that, and that's no one, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=881.5799999999999s)]
*  the right wing has never turned on [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=883.62s)]
*  Israel, the left wing has really [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=885.5s)]
*  never really turned on Israel. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=887.2199999999999s)]
*  No one's allowed to turn on Israel [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=888.6999999999999s)]
*  in America. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=890.54s)]
*  But when you tell the right wing [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=891.62s)]
*  you're not allowed to do something, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=893.22s)]
*  okay, let's see what happens. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=895.18s)]
*  So again, we'll see, I get that I'm [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=896.86s)]
*  predicting unprecedented things, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=899.62s)]
*  but I'm doing that based on what [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=902.3s)]
*  I'm actually seeing on the ground. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=904.3s)]
*  And here we are, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=908.66s)]
*  Tucker Carlson, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=909.54s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor Greene, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=910.42s)]
*  Steve Bannon, Jack Posobiak, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=911.66s)]
*  Mike Cernovich, Candace Owens. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=913.2s)]
*  List goes on and on. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=915.58s)]
*  Charlie Kirk says, I love Israel, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=916.54s)]
*  but I don't know if they should do [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=918.1s)]
*  this. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=919.7s)]
*  Why does he say that? [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=920.0600000000001s)]
*  Because there's a giant uprising [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=921.1s)]
*  in his own audience. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=922.58s)]
*  He did a poll of his audience. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=923.38s)]
*  You want to see how it turned out? [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=925.26s)]
*  Should we go into, [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=927.4200000000001s)]
*  should the US government get [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=928.46s)]
*  involved in Israel's war against [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=930.14s)]
*  Iran? [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=931.94s)]
*  10%, yes, 90%, no. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=932.5s)]
*  90% of Charlie Kirk's audience said [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=936.74s)]
*  no, do not go to war with Iran. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=940.1s)]
*  Right now Trump is going to war [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=944.5400000000001s)]
*  with Iran, so Trump is wrong. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=946.3000000000001s)]
*  So guys, why did I think that was [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=949.5s)]
*  going to happen when before [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=951.62s)]
*  inauguration everyone on the left [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=953.42s)]
*  thought I was totally nuts to say [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=955.74s)]
*  that, right? [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=957.98s)]
*  Because I actually talked to them [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=959.78s)]
*  and I listened to them. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=961.8199999999999s)]
*  And I know it's heresy, heresy to [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=963.4599999999999s)]
*  talk to the other side, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=965.66s)]
*  heresy to listen to them and [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=967.3399999999999s)]
*  treat them as human beings, [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=969.38s)]
*  fellow citizens that we should have [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=971.4399999999999s)]
*  a conversation. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=973.8199999999999s)]
*  I know that there's a lot of [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=975.18s)]
*  disagreement. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=976.78s)]
*  And we think they do terrible [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=978.0600000000001s)]
*  things and they think we do [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=979.58s)]
*  terrible things. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=980.86s)]
*  But as citizens, as fellow Americans, [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=982.14s)]
*  if we don't talk to one another, [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=984.14s)]
*  we don't listen to one another, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=985.7s)]
*  the guys up top are always [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=987.26s)]
*  going to win. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=988.5s)]
*  They're always going to get us to [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=989.66s)]
*  fight each other. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=990.58s)]
*  So when I went on the right wing [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=991.5s)]
*  shows and I went on independent [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=992.62s)]
*  shows, what I heard not from just [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=994.02s)]
*  the hosts, but from their audience [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=996.02s)]
*  was this giant clarion call for, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=998.5s)]
*  we're actually anti-war. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=1000.98s)]
*  We're not lying, we're not lying, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=1003.22s)]
*  we're not lying, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=1006.42s)]
*  we're not kidding, we're anti-war. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=1007.8199999999999s)]
*  So they're not going to agree with [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=1010.9s)]
*  us on immigration. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=1012.4599999999999s)]
*  They're not going to agree with us [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=1013.5s)]
*  on a lot of things, but [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=1014.6999999999999s)]
*  we agree on this. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=1015.8199999999999s)]

*  done to protect ourselves from [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=1054.54s)]

*  Before 9-11, most Americans didn't [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=1057.54s)]
*  even realize that we had foreign [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=1059.4599999999998s)]

*  our own soil. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=1064.34s)]
*  So our fear was then weaponized to [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=1065.3799999999999s)]
*  garner support for that war. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=1067.58s)]
*  Now we're seeing a very similar [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=1070.06s)]
*  pattern playing out in Israel. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=1071.86s)]
*  Israelis feel like victims, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=1074.1399999999999s)]

*  having nukes. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=1083.62s)]
*  And Trump pulled out of the Iran [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=1084.86s)]
*  nuclear deal because Benjamin [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=1086.62s)]

*  in place. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=1094.14s)]
*  So the deal was pulled, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpNgXHkUD0&t=1094.66s)]
