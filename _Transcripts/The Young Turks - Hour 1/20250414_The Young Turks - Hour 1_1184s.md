# Trump Has NO IDEA What He's Doing On Tariffs
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [April 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM)
*  Last Friday, Trump administration announced a number of electronics now, including but [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=0.0s)]
*  not limited to computers, smartphones would be exempt for most of the steep tariffs imposed [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=6.24s)]
*  on China. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=12.82s)]
*  But on Sunday, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick clarified that those exemptions are only temporary [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=14.26s)]
*  and those products will be getting hit with a new tariff soon. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=20.8s)]
*  Let's watch Lutnick go back and forth with a baffled Jonathan Karl. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=25.64s)]
*  Let's talk about that news late Friday, that this exemption on electronics, smartphones, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=32.24s)]
*  laptop, computers and the like. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=37.6s)]
*  What's the thinking? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=39.44s)]
*  Why the exemption? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=40.44s)]
*  Well, if you remember over the past couple of months, President Trump has called out [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=42.24s)]
*  pharmaceuticals and semiconductors and autos. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=48.96s)]
*  He called them sector tariffs and those are not available for negotiation. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=52.48s)]
*  They are just going to be part of making sure we reassure the core national security items [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=58.199999999999996s)]
*  that need to be made in this country. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=65.88s)]
*  We need to make medicine in this country. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=67.6s)]
*  But wait a minute, I'm asking you about the exemption, not about, I mean, the notice that [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=69.52s)]
*  went out Friday night saying that electronics, a wide range of electronics, including smartphones, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=75.52s)]
*  including components used to make microchips, that these are now exempt from the reciprocal [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=81.56s)]
*  tariffs. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=89.39999999999999s)]
*  Why that move? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=90.39999999999999s)]
*  Well, remember those products are going to be part of the semiconductor sectoral tariffs [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=92.39999999999999s)]
*  which are coming. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=100.16s)]
*  So you're saying that the big tariffs on things like smartphones and laptops, iPhones, all [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=101.16s)]
*  those iPhones built in China, that those tariffs are temporarily off but they're going to be [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=109.16s)]
*  coming right back on in another form in a month or so? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=115.32s)]
*  Or what are you saying? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=118.36s)]
*  Correct. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=120.36s)]
*  There's a lot more to this one, but Cenk, I guess take us through that clip, your initial [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=121.36s)]
*  thoughts on, I guess dissect it for us. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=128.28s)]
*  Yeah, so first we had global tariffs and they were definitely going to stick with those [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=131.56s)]
*  because that was going to rebuild manufacturing in America. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=136.04s)]
*  And okay, yeah, well, the stock market and the bond market crashes, so those are really [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=139.14s)]
*  inconvenient. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=142.82s)]
*  So we got nothing in return for concession that they're not going to be global tariffs. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=143.82s)]
*  It's just going to be, yeah, some 10% kind of bare minimum stuff across the board, but [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=147.5s)]
*  overall mainly just on China, 145% on China. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=155.14s)]
*  Okay, so ladies and gentlemen, we got them trying, those are definitely going to stay [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=158.66s)]
*  because we're rebuilding our manufacturing base here in America, okay? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=163.1s)]
*  And we're going to do it against the Chinese. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=166.42s)]
*  Okay, fine, they're not going to stay, they're not, we're going to exempt electronics. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=168.33999999999997s)]
*  So a lot of the things you buy from China like your iPhones and things that are critical [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=173.82s)]
*  here in America. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=179.66s)]
*  So we blinked, no, we're not going to do 145% tariff on those. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=181.17999999999998s)]
*  So oops, that's the second giant concession with absolutely nothing in return. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=186.2s)]
*  Wait, we're not done yet confusing you. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=192.73999999999998s)]
*  Because now, Lutnik is saying, yeah, now look, those tariffs are exempt, the iPhones, etc. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=197.06s)]
*  from China. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=205.89999999999998s)]
*  But they're sectoral tariffs, which we have not yet heard of, and they will be reapplied [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=207.85999999999999s)]
*  at a later date. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=214.66s)]
*  What on God's green earth are you talking about? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=217.06s)]
*  This is such a giant mess. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=220.1s)]
*  Meanwhile, contradicted by other administration staffers at the same time. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=223.18s)]
*  Guys, fish rots from the head down. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=228.82s)]
*  How many times have we told you here? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=230.98s)]
*  Donald Trump has no earthly idea what he's doing. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=233.7s)]
*  There is no grand strategy, there is no art of the deal. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=237.1s)]
*  He just throws stuff against the wall and see what sticks. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=240.2s)]
*  So he's like global tariffs on a stick, 145% tariffs on China, that didn't stick. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=243.57999999999998s)]
*  Exemptions, well, that's well, sectoral tariffs, okay, what is this? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=249.46s)]
*  So every business person in the country is like, Jesus Christ, man, what are you doing? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=255.22s)]
*  So should I manufacture here or should I? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=263.38s)]
*  Should I import or should I? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=265.92s)]
*  Do I still have a business or don't I? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=267.3s)]
*  I don't know, tune in tomorrow, he'll change his mind three more times. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=269.3s)]
*  So Sharon, as we give you the rest of the story here, and we talked this through, one [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=273.06s)]
*  of the important things is, what are we trying to accomplish? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=278.62s)]
*  How is it going to help the average American? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=284.97999999999996s)]
*  And this is super important, what's going to happen next? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=287.34s)]
*  Because I have a pretty good idea what's going to happen next, and it ain't pretty. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=290.06s)]
*  Well, he said he's fine with recession, Cenk, remember, just not depression. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=294.38s)]
*  So just buckle up. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=299.21999999999997s)]
*  And if you thought that was confusing, there's more where that came from. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=302.21999999999997s)]
*  Let's listen to this exchange between Peter Navarro and Kristen Welker. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=306.94s)]
*  There's three kinds, there's the high-end chips, which is the AI future, okay? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=311.82s)]
*  We've got to get control of that, and then there's everything else that fuels our autos [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=315.7s)]
*  and on down. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=320.09999999999997s)]
*  Fair enough, I hear what you're saying on investigation, but there is currently an exclusion [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=321.09999999999997s)]
*  for some of those products. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=326.5s)]
*  You want to call it exclusion, potatoes, potatoes, what it is- [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=328.38s)]
*  No, it's not that the White House called it an exclusion. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=332.06s)]
*  But let's say, let's just, here's, I think another thing that's really important. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=333.38s)]
*  When people talk about the chaos or lack of strength, whatever, you just go back to day [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=339.46s)]
*  one. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=344.21999999999997s)]
*  I was there when the president signed it, it was the second to last order he signed, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=345.21999999999997s)]
*  it was in the over, that night. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=348.18s)]
*  And it was the America First Trade Policy, which laid out every single thing we're doing. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=351.1s)]
*  And it would be remiss for anybody in the media not to review that carefully and see [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=356.54s)]
*  that there's rhyme to a reason and rhythm to what we're doing. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=361.9s)]
*  Why do they agree to go on these shows? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=365.46s)]
*  From US Customs and Border Protection, listen to this, all products that are properly classified [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=370.26s)]
*  in these listed provisions will be excluded from the reciprocal tariffs imposed under [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=375.5s)]
*  executive order 14257. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=380.86s)]
*  So you have that. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=382.74s)]
*  Also took up Navarro's challenge to check out the America First Trade Policy. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=386.38s)]
*  He directed us there. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=391.66s)]
*  It is pretty long, but to sum it up briefly, it calls on the Trump administration to investigate [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=393.42s)]
*  trade deficits with other countries, especially China, and create a new trade policy. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=399.02s)]
*  Okay, so they're all over this and the devil's in the details. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=405.02s)]
*  A new trade policy that promotes investment and productivity, enhances our nation's industrial [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=409.3s)]
*  and technological advantages, it defends our economic and national security and above all, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=414.82s)]
*  benefits American workers, manufacturers, farmers, ranchers, entrepreneurs, and businesses. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=420.82s)]
*  All the people who are hurting from the moment he pressed send on his new policy. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=427.21999999999997s)]
*  Tariff whiplash has gotten so out of control that even Kevin O'Leary, I mean, he loves [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=434.78s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=439.5s)]
*  He's fiercely defended Trump's tariffs, is now admitting Trump administration is not [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=440.73999999999995s)]
*  doing a good job of explaining their strategy. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=445.05999999999995s)]
*  Watch this clip. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=448.46s)]
*  I know you think these. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=449.7s)]
*  Tell me why. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=453.38s)]
*  I think we have a negotiation going on has been detailed ad ad nauseam. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=456.53999999999996s)]
*  It's a little chaotic from the point of view that you don't get a consistent message out [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=461.06s)]
*  of the administration. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=466.58s)]
*  I admit that's a problem. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=467.58s)]
*  Ludnick says one thing, and then Burgum says another. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=469.58s)]
*  That's gotta get cleaned up and that's self-inflicted. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=473.97999999999996s)]
*  They can fix that. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=475.74s)]
*  Now he doesn't exactly blame fish rots, okay? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=477.46000000000004s)]
*  He doesn't blame Trump, but he's saying that they've got to clean up her act, Mr. Wonderful [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=481.58s)]
*  there. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=485.86s)]
*  This morning on CNN, Harry Anton broke down a new poll that revealed Americans are feeling [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=486.86s)]
*  very worried about this economy, you think? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=491.3s)]
*  I believe this is the worst poll that Donald Trump has received in his second term and [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=494.62s)]
*  we can go through it, Jessica. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=498.7s)]
*  Let's talk about the economy, right? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=500.34000000000003s)]
*  Think the economy is getting worse. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=502.3s)]
*  Back in November, it was 42% of Americans. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=503.78000000000003s)]
*  You don't have to be a genius to follow this timeline. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=506.22s)]
*  By February, it was 49%, March 51%. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=508.06s)]
*  Look at where we are now, 53%. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=510.98s)]
*  The clear majority of Americans think the economy is getting worse and that number is [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=513.02s)]
*  rising. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=517.62s)]
*  More responsible for the state of the economy or the economic state. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=518.62s)]
*  In March, CBS News asked about inflation and 38% said it was Joe Biden who was more responsible. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=521.3000000000001s)]
*  Compared to 34% who said Donald Trump, let's jump forward to now in the month of April. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=526.74s)]
*  Look at this number. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=531.74s)]
*  44% of Americans say that Donald Trump is more to blame for the state of the economy [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=533.82s)]
*  than Joe Biden. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=539.5400000000001s)]
*  New tariffs on importing goods, oppose versus favor. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=540.5400000000001s)]
*  You go back to January, look at this, 48% said they favored these new tariffs, these [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=543.74s)]
*  Donald Trump tariffs compared to 46% who oppose. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=549.3000000000001s)]
*  Look at where we are now in the CBS News YouGov poll. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=552.58s)]
*  A switcheroo, Jessica, a switcheroo. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=555.38s)]
*  The clear majority, 58% of Americans oppose these new tariffs compared to just 42% who [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=557.5s)]
*  favor him. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=565.42s)]
*  He hasn't been in office that long. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=566.42s)]
*  And he's been talking about Joe Biden day in and day out and how he's blaming Joe Biden [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=568.22s)]
*  for everything. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=572.82s)]
*  And still these are the numbers. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=574.0s)]
*  It's hard to feel great about the economy of course with all this happening in, well, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=575.74s)]
*  just the last week alone. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=579.82s)]
*  Like we said, whiplash folks, it is that much. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=582.58s)]
*  Just look at it. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=586.18s)]
*  One week and here we have it, okay? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=587.66s)]
*  Universal reciprocal tariffs, a removal back down to 10%. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=592.14s)]
*  50% Chinese tariffs, 90% Chinese tariffs, 104% Chinese tariffs, 125% Chinese tariffs, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=595.14s)]
*  145 Chinese tariffs. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=604.5s)]
*  Electronics exempted, electronics now potentially back on. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=606.98s)]
*  So again, I ask you, Jen, why do they even bother to go on the shows except it's getting [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=611.58s)]
*  out their fake messaging, but perhaps just go on Truth Social for that? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=619.82s)]
*  It's just comical if it didn't hurt so much, if it wasn't so painful. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=624.34s)]
*  There is no rhyme or reason to this except perhaps bullying and then showing that you [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=630.0200000000001s)]
*  have all the chess moves. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=635.62s)]
*  You can make all this chaos happen. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=636.98s)]
*  I mean, what is it? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=638.58s)]
*  Yeah, so there's two different things there. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=640.22s)]
*  So one is how much they do media and two is how they do the media. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=641.7s)]
*  So in terms of how much media they do, I actually agree with them. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=647.2600000000001s)]
*  Media is how you get your message out and they should be doing it over and over and [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=651.9000000000001s)]
*  over again. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=655.2600000000001s)]
*  Democrats don't do it nearly enough. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=656.2600000000001s)]
*  So sending out a bunch of cabinet officials to send your message out, I get it. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=657.94s)]
*  Like for example, Stephen Miller and Caroline Lemmon are all over TV pretending that the [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=662.0200000000001s)]
*  Supreme Court ruled nine to nothing in their favor when they actually ruled nine to nothing [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=666.5799999999999s)]
*  against them. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=671.02s)]
*  But they are saying it so much, the right wing media is picking it up and now they've [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=672.6999999999999s)]
*  convinced at least half the right wing that the Supreme Court ruled with the Trump administration [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=676.54s)]
*  instead of against the Trump administration. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=682.02s)]
*  So that's the power propaganda and you use media to do it. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=684.3399999999999s)]
*  So to me, that's not the issue. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=687.0999999999999s)]
*  The issue is if you're a competent administration and again, if you're in the right wing, you [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=688.66s)]
*  should be more mad at them than I am because they're not doing this in any way that helps [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=693.5799999999999s)]
*  your cause. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=698.86s)]
*  Like what you would do is, hey, these cabinet officials are going to go on or other advisors [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=700.18s)]
*  are going to go on TV this weekend. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=705.86s)]
*  So before you all go on, let's get on a call and figure out what our message is and be [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=708.1999999999999s)]
*  sure that we're clear because especially because the president doesn't know what the hell he's [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=711.66s)]
*  doing and changes his mind every other, I was gonna say every other day, but really, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=715.38s)]
*  as we said earlier, about twice a day, right? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=720.0999999999999s)]
*  So if I was a Trump guy and I was gonna go on TV, I would call Suzy Wiles, the chief [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=722.54s)]
*  of staff and say, tell me exactly where we are right now, right? [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=728.02s)]
*  And then I'd ask her, now what's the percentage chance that Trump's gonna change in the next [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=733.06s)]
*  four hours, six hours, etc., right? [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=737.3399999999999s)]
*  But the bottom line is I'd have a battle plan for my side and to get my message out. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=739.66s)]
*  And it's super obvious from the tape, you can see with your own eyes, they don't have [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=745.8399999999999s)]
*  a battle plan. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=748.9s)]
*  They're not coordinating and they're saying different things, which by the way, every [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=749.98s)]
*  thing that the Trump administration says affects the markets. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=754.98s)]
*  Cuz then the markets are like, it's trades back on. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=758.46s)]
*  No, the tariffs are back on. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=761.58s)]
*  This, that, those things, and it's moving the markets in so many different ways and [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=763.5s)]
*  it's affecting people's ability to plan. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=767.66s)]
*  That's what I was referring to earlier. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=770.14s)]
*  So a lot of the business in this country overhyped their need for stability. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=771.66s)]
*  Like if you ever tweak anything in the government, they're like, no, no, no, we must protect [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=775.7s)]
*  the status quo, we need stability. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=779.42s)]
*  So that's 90% of the time, that's just an excuse, right? [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=781.9799999999999s)]
*  But they base it on a kernel of truth. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=785.2199999999999s)]
*  It's true that businesses need some degree of stability to be able to plan. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=787.5799999999999s)]
*  Are there huge imports, small imports, I'm sorry, huge tariffs, no tariffs, or some tariffs [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=791.02s)]
*  so I can know, do I build, do I bring in products? [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=796.8199999999999s)]
*  How do I plan for the rest of my year and the rest of the next couple of years? [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=799.86s)]
*  This is very normal in the business world, right? [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=805.14s)]
*  So now they can't do any planning because every time they make a plan, then Trump changes [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=807.42s)]
*  it and then changes it again and changes it again. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=811.62s)]
*  So now everything's going haywire and not only is Trump changing it, everyone from the [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=814.2s)]
*  Trump team is saying something different on TV. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=818.14s)]
*  So everybody's including their supporters like Kevin O'Leary are just throwing up their [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=820.66s)]
*  hands and their cameras apparently, that's why a quarter of his face was showing. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=824.34s)]
*  And he's saying like, I don't know what's going on here. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=828.06s)]
*  I mean, how could you possibly know? [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=831.42s)]
*  So yeah, this is super disorganized, why? [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=833.58s)]
*  Trump never plans anything. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=838.5600000000001s)]
*  If I was gonna do tariffs, I'd have a plan A, a plan B, a plan C. Plan B would be, hey, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=841.34s)]
*  what if the markets go south? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=847.5200000000001s)]
*  How long are we going to let them go south? [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=849.1s)]
*  Is there a number at which we say, hey, wait, this has gone too far? [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=851.94s)]
*  How long do we plan to do X, Y, or Z? [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=855.62s)]
*  But they haven't planned any of that, any of it. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=858.0200000000001s)]
*  It is as usual deep incompetence because the president is super lazy and he thinks he's [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=861.6999999999999s)]
*  a genius. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=868.8199999999999s)]
*  So he just flies off the handle. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=869.8199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, tariffs against China, 104%, 125%, 145%. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=871.5799999999999s)]
*  Come on man, Jesus Christ. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=881.38s)]
*  So you don't have to be left wing to see that looks like a clown move, one after another [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=883.9799999999999s)]
*  after another. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=890.04s)]
*  So finally, this is the most important part, what's gonna happen in the future? [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=891.14s)]
*  So I'm gonna read one of our members comments here. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=894.02s)]
*  He's from Canada, but is this is soon gonna apply to America as well? [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=896.26s)]
*  He said, yeah, the tariffs finally affected me. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=899.5s)]
*  I live in a small community in Canada, and I have to look for new employment because [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=901.38s)]
*  my employer lost some contracts due to delays attributed to tariffs. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=904.78s)]
*  So okay, so that happens to be in Canada, but that's gonna happen all over America, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=909.62s)]
*  because the same exact phenomenon. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=914.46s)]
*  The employers don't know, do I hire, do I fire? [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=916.34s)]
*  Do I have enough money to hire people? [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=919.58s)]
*  Do I have enough money to keep people? [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=920.98s)]
*  The first immediate problem with the stock market turning down is not how it affects [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=924.1800000000001s)]
*  rich people or corporations, it's how it affects your 401k. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=927.3000000000001s)]
*  Okay, so we got that. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=930.34s)]
*  But depending on the situation, we can get past that, right? [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=932.34s)]
*  The second way that it affects people is if it goes dramatically down, then businesses [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=934.98s)]
*  start to tighten up and they stop hiring and they start firing, right? [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=939.02s)]
*  So that's what's coming next. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=944.66s)]
*  And then the third thing that happens is that because they now have this huge cost added [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=947.02s)]
*  on top, they're going to start increasing prices. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=951.98s)]
*  Now because he pulled a lot of the tariffs back, it won't be as universal as it was. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=955.1s)]
*  But still, these are some significant tariffs on plenty of places. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=959.28s)]
*  So you're not gonna see all of your prices going up, but now you're gonna see prices [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=963.86s)]
*  pop one after another after another in places you don't expect. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=967.54s)]
*  You go to buy a car, now the car costs 20% more, what the hell, what just happened, etc., [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=971.5s)]
*  And you know what that's going to do? [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=976.9399999999999s)]
*  That's gonna drive his poll numbers way down. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=978.78s)]
*  Because those numbers that Enten showed are before people have actually started to get [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=981.5s)]
*  affected in their personal lives. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=986.4599999999999s)]
*  Once they start getting affected, they're gonna be mad. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=989.0999999999999s)]
*  What was the number one reason they elected Trump? [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=993.9399999999999s)]
*  Because of inflation. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=996.6999999999999s)]
*  And what did he just do? [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=997.6999999999999s)]
*  He just poured an enormous amount of fuel on that fire. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=999.26s)]
*  You know what Trump's like with the tariffs and inflation? [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=1003.62s)]
*  He's like that scene in Zoolander where they're spraying each other with gasoline, right? [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=1007.38s)]
*  And then somebody lights a match. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=1014.38s)]
*  And as Trump said about the markets, they're gonna go boom, just not boom in the direction [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=1016.5s)]
*  that he was hoping for. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=1021.94s)]
*  So next will be rage. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=1023.54s)]
*  And then Trump will backpedal because he hates having low numbers. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=1026.74s)]
*  And he will have disastrously low numbers. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=1030.52s)]
*  And then we'll have another round of uncertainty and what's gonna happen next. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=1032.94s)]
*  But here's what's not going to happen. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=1037.04s)]
*  We're not going to rebuild manufacturing with clown ass tariffs like this. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=1038.8200000000002s)]
*  No, and back to the messaging. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=1043.5s)]
*  I mean, I get it, what you said makes perfect sense. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=1045.8200000000002s)]
*  But I will say this, how do you plan for anything? [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=1048.66s)]
*  I'd love to declare everybody around him incompetent, but how can you, even Suzy, how can you plan [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=1051.6200000000001s)]
*  for anything when the man at the top seems so emotional and reactionary and somewhat [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=1057.22s)]
*  unhinged? [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=1062.76s)]
*  Sometimes it seems like some of these people are on the air, Navarro, whoever else. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=1064.94s)]
*  And he's literally tweeted something that's making for breaking news that they can't even [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=1069.98s)]
*  keep up with. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=1073.94s)]
*  It's asinine. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=1075.18s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's an apt description of it, for sure. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=1076.18s)]
*  And just to be super clear. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=1081.46s)]
*  Yeah, I actually blame Lutnick and Navarro, etc., a lot less than I blame Trump. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=1083.22s)]
*  Because Navarro's pushing his agendas, and I hate his agenda. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=1090.02s)]
*  And he's one of these guys that's just so over the top on tariffs. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=1094.5800000000002s)]
*  And I think it does the cause of tariffs actually more harm than good. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=1099.06s)]
*  And so I got no love for any of these guys. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=1102.1000000000001s)]
*  But like you mentioned, Suzy Wallace, Chief of Staff, she's perfectly competent. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=1105.1000000000001s)]
*  She's shown that she's competent and gotten Trump under control when she needed to on [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=1109.14s)]
*  a number of occasions, and we've shared that on the show. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=1114.42s)]
*  But even Suzy Wallace can't wrangle the most unwrangled guy on earth. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=1117.94s)]
*  Because you're absolutely right, Trump won't ever listen to reason. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=1123.26s)]
*  And now that he's gotten elected again, he thinks he's a demigod. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=1126.16s)]
*  He thinks he doesn't need anyone else, and he thinks he's like some sort of supernova [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=1129.74s)]
*  genius because he passes dementia tests. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=1133.14s)]
*  And so that's why he just lashes out, and no one can correct him because his skin is [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=1136.26s)]
*  so thin. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=1141.54s)]
*  He's so deeply insecure that no one can say, hey, Mr. President, it might not be a great [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=1143.42s)]
*  idea to change the tariffs on China literally six times in a row within a span of about [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=1149.42s)]
*  three days. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=1155.74s)]
*  Maybe we need a little bit more stability. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=1158.1000000000001s)]
*  If any of them actually suggested that, you're like, what are you talking about? [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=1159.94s)]
*  You're terrible, you're fired. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=1162.94s)]
*  I'm very disappointed in my commerce, Secretary. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=1164.9s)]
*  And then he goes sends them on air, and then when they make clowns of themselves because [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=1167.74s)]
*  Trump told them to, he goes, I'm very disappointed, right? [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=1171.56s)]
*  So there's no winning with this guy. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=1175.64s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below, an angel gets his wings. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=1178.18s)]
*  Totally not true, but it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKIxNeEJNM&t=1181.1000000000001s)]
