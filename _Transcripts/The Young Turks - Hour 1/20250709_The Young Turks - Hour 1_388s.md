"VINCENT OSHANA (PANELIST): [unintelligible] Okay listen, I think Donald Trump deserves a Nobel Peace Prize for the last administration. No wars, zero. No what? Soleimani, killed one person, but like, this is just-- he just helped bomb another country, and you're and he's offering him a peace prize. That's like giving Jeffrey Dahmer a Michelin star for his unique taste in meat. It's the wrong time. It should have happened four years ago. And I'm not saying, it's not they killed a bunch of people, but you, you just technically went to war. How are you gonna give him a peace prize? It doesn't make any sense to me. So, like I said, he deserves it for the last four years. He doesn't deserve it for right now. "

# PBD Podcast RIPS The Idea Of Trump Earning A Nobel Peace Prize
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [July 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI)
*  He just helped bomb another country and he's offering him a peace prize. That's like giving [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=0.0s)]
*  Jeffrey Dahmer a Michelin star for his unique taste in meat. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=5.48s)]
*  There's the quote of the day. You just watched Trump fan and PBD podcast host Vinny Ashada [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=10.6s)]
*  not only mock the idea of giving Donald Trump a Nobel Prize, peace prize, but also compared [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=16.9s)]
*  to giving cannibalistic serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer a Michelin star. It's that ridiculous [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=22.1s)]
*  in his view. His comments come after Benjamin Netanyahu presented Trump with a letter nominating [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=27.9s)]
*  him for the peace prize at their White House meeting. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=33.22s)]
*  He argued that he deserved the Nobel Prize for helping to broker a ceasefire between [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=36.22s)]
*  Israel and Iran. But Vinny, who's been extremely critical of Netanyahu and Israel's war in [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=41.739999999999995s)]
*  Gaza argued this is the wrong time to shower Donald Trump with praise and awards. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=49.62s)]
*  Okay, listen, I think Donald Trump deserves a Nobel Peace Prize for the last administration. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=55.58s)]
*  No wars, zero. Like, Solomon, he killed one person, but like this is just he just helped [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=62.76s)]
*  bomb another country and he's offering him a peace prize. That's like giving Jeffrey [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=68.94s)]
*  Dahmer a Michelin star for his unique taste in meat. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=73.56s)]
*  It's the wrong time. It should have happened four years ago. And I'm not saying it's not [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=76.72s)]
*  They killed a bunch of people, but you just technically went to war. How are you going [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=81.34s)]
*  to give him a peace prize? It doesn't make any sense to me. So like I said, he deserves [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=86.18s)]
*  it for the last four years. He doesn't deserve it for right now. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=92.34s)]
*  Yes, the math ain't math in according to Vinny. Jen, is it just a timing issue here? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=95.66s)]
*  Yeah, no, no, no. He definitely is not deserve a Nobel Peace Prize for the first term either. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=101.94s)]
*  I mean, that's honest and that is super harsh against Trump. Giving Jeffrey Dahmer a prize [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=107.98s)]
*  for the food he eats. He's comparing Trump to Jeffrey Dahmer and Vinny is super right [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=117.86s)]
*  wing. So apparently they would break. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=125.74000000000001s)]
*  So and then is it real on the Jeffrey Epstein stuff? It's very real. The break is super, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=129.86s)]
*  super real. And on Israel is the break real? Yeah, the break is real. There's a huge fight, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=137.7s)]
*  but Vinny is on the side of enough, enough, enough with the war, enough with the constant [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=142.66s)]
*  bombings and most importantly for the right wing, enough with giving them money to do [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=148.14s)]
*  all this nonsense. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=152.57999999999998s)]
*  They said America first, they meant America first. I have a thousand disagreements with [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=154.38s)]
*  Vinny, but I like him because he's honest and right. And others will say, my God, I [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=157.54s)]
*  can't believe Jen said that he likes Vinny. I hate him 10,000 times more now. I hate meaning [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=162.06s)]
*  me. So let's come back and talk about that in a second, but let's give you the rest [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=166.78s)]
*  of the story first. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=170.5s)]
*  Yeah, Vinny's fellow PBD podcast host Adam Sosnick had a different take. Adam is also [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=171.74s)]
*  a big fan of Donald Trump, but unlike Vinny, he has been a diehard defender of Israel and [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=177.5s)]
*  America's support for their war. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=182.26s)]
*  Now you talked about whether Trump should get the Nobel Peace Prize. There's two parts [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=184.58s)]
*  to that. There's something called peace through strength. I think if you look at what Israel [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=189.22s)]
*  has done in conjunction with the United States, they basically looked at, I would call it [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=194.22s)]
*  warmongering psychopaths, jihadists, and said we're gonna have to take care of these people [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=198.9s)]
*  before they take care of us. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=203.82s)]
*  So they went after Hamas, the Houthis, still dealing with that, Hezbollah, Syria, Islamic [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=205.54000000000002s)]
*  jihad, tip of the spear with Iran. And I think that Trump will be nominated for a Nobel Peace [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=212.26000000000002s)]
*  Prize when the dust settles in the Middle East. So we'll see what happens with that. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=218.56s)]
*  Should Donald Trump get credit for the strength he's at least projecting, talking to keep [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=223.86s)]
*  people safe? Is that a form of peace? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=230.98000000000002s)]
*  That was hilarious. I don't even know if Adam realizes how funny that was. He's like, so [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=233.58s)]
*  Israel attacked Gaza, West Bank, Houthis, Yemen, Syria, Lebanon, Iran, for like 20 minutes, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=240.48000000000002s)]
*  all the countries and places and people that Israel has attacked. And then because Donald [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=248.5s)]
*  Trump supported and funded their war making throughout the Middle East, he deserves a [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=253.42s)]
*  peace prize? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=259.42s)]
*  That's what you would do if you were parodying Donald Trump. If it was like an SNL skit or [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=263.42s)]
*  something, you would do what Adam just did, except he was being genuine. And by the way, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=267.82s)]
*  that is the Israeli position. The Israeli position is, we had to murder all of them [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=274.5s)]
*  before they did terrorism against us. We had to invade them, we had to attack them because [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=278.62s)]
*  we're just being preemptive self-defense. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=284.3s)]
*  What is that? That's not self-defense. It's not preemptive. That's just you attacking [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=288.38s)]
*  other countries. And by the way, there they are in Southern Lebanon and Western Syria, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=292.34s)]
*  70% of Gaza, taking more land in the West Bank because they had to defend themselves. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=298.34s)]
*  No, they're an aggressive imperial empire that commits terrorism on the regular, like [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=304.02000000000004s)]
*  literally every day murdering civilians. They know they're civilians, they know they're [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=309.70000000000005s)]
*  killing them, they do it on purpose and they do it to take land. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=313.62s)]
*  They're one of the most aggressive empires of my lifetime, taking more and more land [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=317.66s)]
*  throughout all of these years and decades. And then mythology, the Arabs started in 1948. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=324.3s)]
*  No, they didn't. Israel started it by driving the Palestinians out of their homes. They [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=329.98s)]
*  drove 750,000 Palestinians out. The Arab countries attacked us in 1967. No, they didn't. You [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=333.7s)]
*  attacked them. You destroyed their air force when they weren't expecting it. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=342.7s)]
*  And then you blitzkrieg them and you took the Sinai, you took the occupied territories, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=347.26s)]
*  etc. But we're supposed to give supporters of Israel a peace prize for all the wars we [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=352.18s)]
*  helped them create. I mean, are there no bounds of irony left? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=359.76s)]
*  No, and Donald Trump don't forget said there's gonna be a beautiful resort. He's gonna take [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=366.76s)]
*  all of that beachfront property and it's gonna be nice and everybody's gonna be happy and [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=371.36s)]
*  that'll be peaceful too. So maybe that's what Bibi was thinking of. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=376.08s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below, an angel gets his swings. Totally not true, but it [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=381.36s)]
*  does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhtSIzpDHI&t=385.56s)]
