The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

What does it mean to be a ‚ÄúYoung Turk?‚Äù

According to the American Heritage Dictionary;
1. Young progressive or insurgent member of an institution, movement, or political party. 
2. Young person who rebels against authority or societal expectations.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

# Elon Musk's Threats To Federal Employees Overruled by Unlikely Sources
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [February 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU)
*  We have people that don't show up to work and nobody even knows if they work for the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=0.0s)]
*  government. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=3.92s)]
*  So by asking the question, tell us what you did this week, what he's doing is saying, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=4.92s)]
*  are you actually working? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  And then if you don't answer, you're sort of semi-fired or you're fired because a lot [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  of people are not answering because they don't even exist. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=16.96s)]
*  They're trying to, that's how badly various parts of our government were run by it, especially [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=20.2s)]
*  by this last group. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=25.68s)]
*  President Donald Trump took a moment to defend Elon Musk during a press conference with French [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=27.68s)]
*  President Emmanuel Macron. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=34.28s)]
*  And that defense came in light of an email that Musk and Doge sent to federal workers [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=36.58s)]
*  essentially demanding that they justify their positions and the work that they're doing [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  in the federal government. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=47.82s)]
*  And if they fail to do so, they will likely be terminated. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=49.46s)]
*  Now there's been some pushback among Trump cabinet officials in regard to what Elon [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=53.62s)]
*  Musk is doing, right Cenk? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=59.72s)]
*  Yes, in fact, the pushback has resulted in something that just happened that kind of [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=62.3s)]
*  resolves the issue on fired or semi-fired as Donald Trump just said. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=68.25999999999999s)]
*  We'll get to that in a second. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=72.94s)]
*  So this all started over the weekend when Musk posted this on X, consistent with President [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=74.62s)]
*  Donald Trump's instructions. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=81.56s)]
*  All federal employees will shortly receive an email requesting to understand what they [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=83.24s)]
*  got done last week. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=89.08s)]
*  Failure to respond will be taken as a resignation. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=90.8s)]
*  I gotta say, this is the kind of corporate culture that makes everyone insane, usually [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=94.6s)]
*  in private sector jobs. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=101.16s)]
*  And it's awesome that now it's being implemented in public sector jobs as well. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=102.8s)]
*  Awesome micromanaging, but nonetheless, then an email was sent late Saturday by the Office [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=107.32000000000001s)]
*  of Personnel Management with the subject line, what did you do last week? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=113.04s)]
*  In it, it reads, please reply to this email with approximately five bullets of what you [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=119.04s)]
*  accomplished last week and CC your manager, the email said. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=124.44s)]
*  Please do not send any classified information, links or attachments. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=128.48000000000002s)]
*  Now federal workers were also told in that email to justify their jobs by midnight tonight [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=132.92s)]
*  or risk getting fired. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=140.2s)]
*  And so when someone responded to his post with an accusation that he's running the Twitter [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=142.0s)]
*  playbook on the government, Musk basically confirmed, yeah, that's basically what I'm [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=148.04s)]
*  doing. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=153.35999999999999s)]
*  In fact, he argued, yeah, this works. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=154.35999999999999s)]
*  Trump seems to agree with Elon Musk, as you heard in the video that we showed you earlier [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=156.48s)]
*  in this segment. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=160.48s)]
*  In fact, Musk's post came hours after the president expressed that he wants Elon Musk [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=161.72s)]
*  to get even more aggressive with what he's doing. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=168.4s)]
*  He wrote in a truth social post all caps, Elon is doing a great job, but I would like [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=171.68s)]
*  to see him get more aggressive. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=176.44s)]
*  Remember, we have a country to save, but ultimately to make greater than ever before and he ends [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=178.76s)]
*  it with MAGA. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=184.8s)]
*  But not everyone agrees and that includes top officials in several federal agencies [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=186.44s)]
*  and departments. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=192.20000000000002s)]
*  We're talking about cabinet officials, we're talking about people who were nominated by [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=193.20000000000002s)]
*  Donald Trump confirmed by the Senate. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=198.44s)]
*  They're basically telling their employees, their staff in these federal agencies, don't [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=200.8s)]
*  respond to this email. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=205.12s)]
*  I'll tell you who in just a moment, but Cenk, any thoughts so far? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=206.28s)]
*  So breaking news, like I said in a sec here, but when we did the poll for this story, which [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=208.92s)]
*  is in the live chat, check it out now, vote if you can. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=216.79999999999998s)]
*  We asked who's right, Cash Patel or Elon Musk, because Cash Patel was drawing the line here. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=221.0s)]
*  And I'm curious about it for left wing, right wing, I mean, and I did a poll on it on X [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=226.2s)]
*  and it's about two thirds saying Cash Patel and now Pete Hegseth, who joined him next [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=232.82s)]
*  are right and Elon Musk is wrong. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=238.82s)]
*  It's not scientific, but it's just an interesting way of telling where folks are going. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=240.73999999999998s)]
*  So well, even though Trump sent that note saying, hey, be more aggressive than Elon [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=246.26s)]
*  took that as a green light to do this type of thing. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=252.73999999999998s)]
*  And he seemed to be backing him with that fired or semi-fired comment. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=255.57999999999998s)]
*  By the way, how is anyone semi-fired? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=259.06s)]
*  Okay, well, we'll maybe find out on another day, because Office of Personnel and [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=262.29999999999995s)]
*  Management is called OPM and they just came out with this. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=266.06s)]
*  This afternoon, OPM during a Chief Human Capital Officers Council's meeting, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=268.78s)]
*  informed agencies that employee responses to the OPM email is voluntary. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=272.65999999999997s)]
*  OPM also clarified that non-response to the email does not equate to a resignation. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=277.78s)]
*  So apparently, Elon walked back and we will not be able to do this. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=283.53999999999996s)]
*  And now, look, we're in the business of credit where credit is due. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=289.9s)]
*  I did not have Cash Patel standing up to anyone and [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=293.97999999999996s)]
*  doing the right thing on any bingo card I have ever had in my life. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=297.06s)]
*  But here, Cash Patel did the right thing. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=301.82s)]
*  It led to a domino effect and [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=303.94s)]
*  now Elon Musk has walked back on this absurd idea. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=306.06s)]
*  And I'll tell you why I think it's absurd in a second. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=310.26s)]
*  We'll back to you, Ana. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=312.17999999999995s)]
*  So several officials have basically told their staff members to avoid responding to [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=313.74s)]
*  that email that broke prior to what Cenk just described. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=319.02s)]
*  So for instance, for now, please pause any response, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=323.46s)]
*  a top Pentagon official told employees this weekend. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=326.86s)]
*  Adding that the Defense Department will conduct any review in accordance with its [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=330.26s)]
*  own procedures. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=334.09999999999997s)]
*  Others who sent out similar messages, yes, include FBI Director Cash Patel, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=335.5s)]
*  who wrote that FBI personnel may have received an email from OPM requesting [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=341.02000000000004s)]
*  information, the FBI, through the office of the director is in charge of all [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=346.42s)]
*  of our review processes and will conduct reviews in accordance with FBI procedures. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=351.74s)]
*  When and if further information is required, we will coordinate the responses. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=357.38s)]
*  For now, please pause any responses. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=361.90000000000003s)]
*  Other agencies telling their employees to essentially hold off on responding to [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=364.66s)]
*  Elon Musk's email included DNI Director Tulsi Gabbard, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=368.70000000000005s)]
*  the State Department National Security Agency, the Defense Information Systems [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=372.82000000000005s)]
*  Agency, the National Science Foundation, which is a division of the Air Force. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=377.90000000000003s)]
*  The Director's Office of the Administrative Office of US Courts, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=383.26000000000005s)]
*  which manages the federal judiciary staff, NASA and the CDC. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=387.62s)]
*  So several federal government agencies or [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=393.14000000000004s)]
*  top officials within these agencies told their staff, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=396.14000000000004s)]
*  just hold off on responding to Elon Musk's message. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=399.38s)]
*  Now many agency leaders are tired of having to justify specific intricacies of [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=402.70000000000005s)]
*  agency policy and having to scramble to address unforeseen controversies raised by [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=408.82000000000005s)]
*  Musk, especially after the billionaire's so-called Department of [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=414.54s)]
*  Government Efficiency gained unprecedented access to government systems. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=419.5s)]
*  There is an exception here though, and that exception is RFK Jr., [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=424.02000000000004s)]
*  who is now the Secretary of Health and Human Services. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=428.06s)]
*  He told his staff to respond to Elon Musk's email. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=431.62s)]
*  I'm unclear on whether they will continue to do so now that a directive has been [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=435.70000000000005s)]
*  issued by the Office of Personnel Management, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=440.54s)]
*  basically telling people this is voluntary. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=443.5s)]
*  But the bulwark Sam Stein prior to that breaking news story obtained an email from [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=446.1s)]
*  HHS, again, with RFK Jr. ordering staff to essentially respond to Elon Musk's message, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=451.74s)]
*  which is unfortunate to say the least. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=458.78s)]
*  Now, I like the fact that there's dissent within the administration. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=462.21999999999997s)]
*  I think that's a good thing. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=467.14s)]
*  Up until now, Elon Musk has been able to basically act with absolutely no checks, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=468.26s)]
*  no balances, no one to pump the brakes. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=472.46s)]
*  And the thing that doesn't really inspire much confidence is [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=475.09999999999997s)]
*  the inaccurate statements he's posting on X day in and day out without providing [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=479.14000000000004s)]
*  receipts for it. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=484.58000000000004s)]
*  And the fact that important employees, federal workers, had been fired and [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=486.26000000000005s)]
*  then had to be rehired or their firing had been rescinded. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=490.22s)]
*  Because it turns out they have important roles like protecting our nuclear arsenal, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=493.74s)]
*  or working on the bird flu, which is of course wiping out birds and [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=498.34000000000003s)]
*  lowering our supply of eggs and things like that. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=504.78000000000003s)]
*  And it's now also transferring over as an illness for humans. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=507.06s)]
*  So there needs to be a better method moving forward in deciding or [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=511.14s)]
*  determining where the waste actually is. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=515.66s)]
*  Because again, treating the federal government as if it's Twitter is not [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=518.6999999999999s)]
*  really the right way to go about it. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=522.62s)]
*  Yeah, so couldn't agree more. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=524.5s)]
*  When he did this to Twitter, if you remember, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=528.34s)]
*  there was a whole bunch of glitches. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=530.34s)]
*  The site would go down for a while, you couldn't get responses to this or that. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=531.98s)]
*  And a lot of those glitches continue. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=535.86s)]
*  And by the way, the thing that people don't talk much about is that when he did [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=537.1800000000001s)]
*  that, all sorts of terrible content got onto Twitter, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=541.94s)]
*  including terrorist propaganda, child porn, etc. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=545.38s)]
*  And they're like, I have less guardrails, so what? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=548.2600000000001s)]
*  Okay, now that's your company, you want to do that, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=553.5400000000001s)]
*  you want to devalue your company, that's your problem, not my problem, right? [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=555.38s)]
*  That's a private company. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=558.1400000000001s)]
*  But when you do it in the government and [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=559.38s)]
*  people are worried about losing their social security checks, etc. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=560.74s)]
*  That is not going to play well. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=563.74s)]
*  The government is not the same as your private company. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=565.3399999999999s)]
*  So in fact, real quick, a couple of viewers here, Kelly Kasey, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=568.66s)]
*  if Crazy Cash Patel is telling his employees not to follow this, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=572.6999999999999s)]
*  you know it's gone too far. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=575.66s)]
*  And so look, by the way, become a member either through the join button below or [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=577.54s)]
*  tyt.com and be part of this show and be part of the live polls too at 6 o'clock [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=580.9799999999999s)]
*  Eastern everyday. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=585.38s)]
*  Dirge wrote in, the real reason they wanted those emails is to scan them for [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=585.9399999999999s)]
*  words they don't like such as diverse or women so they know who to fire. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=589.38s)]
*  By the way, there's some truth, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=592.66s)]
*  potential truth to that because Speaker Johnson was talking about how Elon Musk [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=593.86s)]
*  is running algorithms on the information he's getting on federal workers right now. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=598.94s)]
*  Algorithms to do what? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=603.9000000000001s)]
*  And probably to find words like diversity so [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=605.86s)]
*  they can fire anyone that's involved in it. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=608.5400000000001s)]
*  It's insanity. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=610.2600000000001s)]
*  So and that's leading to these results, a good graphic aid. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=611.62s)]
*  58% of respondents are worried that programs like students, financial aid and [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=614.82s)]
*  social security payments could face delays. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=620.2600000000001s)]
*  So a lot of Maga thinks that they're the entire country just because they won [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=622.98s)]
*  the election. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=625.94s)]
*  No, that's 58% of the country saying tap the brakes, we're super worried. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=626.82s)]
*  42% say that they support the advisory group, while 53% say they do not. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=631.5s)]
*  So Doge is underwater, this is a Reuters ipsis poll. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=637.5s)]
*  And finally, 62% disagree with the notion that the president is authorized to [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=640.94s)]
*  terminate federal employees who do not align with his views or agenda. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=644.7800000000001s)]
*  About 23% said he should be entitled to make that decision. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=648.98s)]
*  Super quick clarification there, is one thing to have a political appointment. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=652.06s)]
*  It's another thing to fire somebody at the post office because you don't agree [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=656.74s)]
*  with their political views. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=659.86s)]
*  I ain't got nothing to do with anything. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=661.5799999999999s)]
*  So the president gets to make political appointments, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=662.98s)]
*  he doesn't get to randomly fire people who disagree with him. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=665.54s)]
*  And a lot of these firings are impacting individuals who voted for Donald Trump. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=668.62s)]
*  A lot of individuals who are actually veterans, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=673.38s)]
*  about 30% of the federal government workforce consists of veterans. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=676.1s)]
*  And so it's easy to understand how these seemingly indiscriminate firings [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=680.3399999999999s)]
*  are leading to some souring, certainly on Elon Musk. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=684.78s)]
*  But at this point, also in regard to Donald Trump and [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=688.26s)]
*  the performance he's putting out as president. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dXjkyoTKpU&t=691.18s)]
