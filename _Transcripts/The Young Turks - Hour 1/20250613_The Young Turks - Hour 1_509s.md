"Brevard County Sheriff Wayne Ivey had an ominous warning to violent protesters and rioters ahead of Saturday's "No Kings" rallies against President Donald Trump's immigration policies.
Ivey said in part at a Thursday press conference, "If you throw a brick, a firebomb, or point a gun at one of our deputies, we will be notifying your family where to collect your remains at. Because we will kill you, graveyard dead. We're not going to play."

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

# This Sheriff REALLY Needs To Settle Down
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s)
*  If you throw a brick, a fire bomb, or point a gun at one of our deputies, we will be notifying [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=0.0s)]
*  your family where to collect your remains at, because we will kill you graveyard dead. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=6.0s)]
*  With anti-ICE and anti-Trump protests planned across the country over the weekend, law enforcement [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=12.32s)]
*  and Republican leadership is getting ahead of any potential violence and rioting by issuing [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=17.84s)]
*  threats directly to the American people. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=22.84s)]
*  Americans are actively pushing the narrative that protesters in Los Angeles were violent, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=25.84s)]
*  dangerous and generally disruptive before the president unleashed the National Guard [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=30.080000000000002s)]
*  and US Marines on them. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=34.4s)]
*  But meanwhile, Trump plans to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the US Army with a military [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=36.56s)]
*  parade in Washington DC tomorrow, which just so happens to coincide with his birthday. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=43.040000000000006s)]
*  How nice for him. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=48.28s)]
*  However, in all 50 states and Washington DC, protests are being planned against Trump and [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  his administration. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=55.28s)]
*  There will be roughly 1,500 no-Kings rallies across the country tomorrow, as well as several [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=56.64s)]
*  kick out the clowns rallies. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=62.0s)]
*  When asked about the planned rallies, White House Press Secretary Caroline Leavitt did [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=64.08s)]
*  little to distinguish between a protester and a violent criminal. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=68.08s)]
*  I think that those images of foreign flags being waved by illegal criminals and by violent [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=71.64s)]
*  rioters in the face of cars blowing up and of flames in the city. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=78.04s)]
*  I have photos of that here to show you with this violence and destruction that occurred [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=84.52s)]
*  is an image that Governor Gavin Newsom owned. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=90.0s)]
*  But to get ahead of these protests, Republican officials and law enforcement agents are issuing [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=93.64s)]
*  threats. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=98.28s)]
*  Trump himself had this to say, if there's any protester that wants to come out, they [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=99.4s)]
*  will be met with very big force, Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=103.88s)]
*  I haven't even heard about a protest, but this is people that hate our country, but [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=108.0s)]
*  they will be met with very heavy force. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=113.64s)]
*  The following day, Leavitt did clarify Trump's statements saying that Trump supports peaceful [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=116.39999999999999s)]
*  protests even though in his statement, he never specified that only violent protesters [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=120.44s)]
*  would be met with very big force. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=125.8s)]
*  But then we have statements like this one from Wayne Ivey, the sheriff from Brevard [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=128.56s)]
*  County, Florida, take a look. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=132.07999999999998s)]
*  If you resist lawful orders, you're going to jail. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=133.79999999999998s)]
*  Let me be very clear about that. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=137.4s)]
*  If you block an intersection or a roadway in Brevard County, you are going to jail. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=139.52s)]
*  If you flee arrest, you're gonna go to jail tight because we are gonna run you down and [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=144.72s)]
*  put you in jail. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=149.70000000000002s)]
*  If you try to mob rule a car in Brevard County, gathering around it, refusing to let the driver [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=151.28s)]
*  leave, in our county, you're most likely gonna get run over and dragged across the street. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=156.96s)]
*  If you spit on us, you're going to the hospital and in jail. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=163.96s)]
*  If you hit one of us, you're going to the hospital and jail and most likely get bitten [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=168.56s)]
*  by one of our big beautiful dogs that we have here. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=173.68s)]
*  If you throw a brick, a fire bomb or point a gun at one of our deputies, we will be notifying [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=177.44s)]
*  your family where to collect your remains at because we will kill you graveyard dead. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=182.76s)]
*  All right, then we have Florida Governor Ron DeSantis who I had actually forgotten is still [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=188.24s)]
*  the governor of Florida. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=193.26s)]
*  He also is now encouraging violence against his own constituents. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=194.88s)]
*  And we also have a policy that if you're driving on one of those streets and a mob comes and [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=199.0s)]
*  surrounds your vehicle and threatens you, you have a right to flee for your safety. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=204.57999999999998s)]
*  And so if you drive off and you hit one of these people, that's their fault for impinging [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=210.06s)]
*  on you. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=215.26s)]
*  You don't have to sit there and just be a sitting duck and let the mob grab you out [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=217.06s)]
*  of your car and drag you through the streets. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=221.26s)]
*  You have a right to defend yourself in Florida. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=223.68s)]
*  All right, well meanwhile, here in Texas, Republican Governor Greg Abbott has announced [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=225.76000000000002s)]
*  that he has ordered the deployment of 5,000 Texas National Guard troops, as well as 2,000 [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=230.88s)]
*  state police to assist local law enforcement tomorrow, specifically in the democratic cities [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=236.76000000000002s)]
*  where no Kings protests are planned. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=241.9s)]
*  That's right here in Houston, also Dallas, Austin, San Antonio. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=244.26000000000002s)]
*  Protests have already begun in Texas where police use chemical irritants against protesters [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=248.5s)]
*  in Dallas and Austin. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=252.88000000000002s)]
*  In San Antonio near the Alamo, National Guard members were spotted at a protest Wednesday. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=254.48000000000002s)]
*  So I know you guys are gonna be covering the birthday parade tomorrow, Cenk, but here's [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=260.44s)]
*  a fun fact. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=264.5s)]
*  $16 million is expected to be spent just on repairing the roads of Washington DC after [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=265.5s)]
*  the military tanks tear up the roads. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=271.08000000000004s)]
*  The tanks don't need to drive on these roads because all of this is so unnecessary. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=273.46000000000004s)]
*  But Trump is insisting that this happens, knowing that the roads will need millions [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=277.52000000000004s)]
*  of dollars worth of repairs afterward. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=281.7s)]
*  But what does he care? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=284.3s)]
*  It's not his money. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=285.40000000000003s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=286.90000000000003s)]
*  Cenk, is this the way that you would expect law enforcement to serve and protect the American [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=287.90000000000003s)]
*  people? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=292.86s)]
*  No. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=293.86s)]
*  So you're right. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=294.86s)]
*  We're covering it. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=296.74s)]
*  Young Turks on YouTube 6.30 PM Eastern tomorrow. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=297.74s)]
*  Me and Ben Cohen of Ben and Jerry's. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=300.94s)]
*  Check out that military parade and Trump's birthday party and you'll get a lot of good [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=303.14s)]
*  facts out of there too. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=307.26s)]
*  Now on this story, how it started, freedom of speech is the most important right there [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=309.28s)]
*  is we have to let people say terrible things on Twitter. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=315.84s)]
*  We have to freedom of speech. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=319.12s)]
*  How it's going? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=320.84s)]
*  You protest Trump, we'll put your graveyard dead. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=322.2s)]
*  Think something got lost in the translation. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=327.52s)]
*  I get it. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=329.68s)]
*  He said if you cause violence or you point a gun, etc. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=330.68s)]
*  But obviously he was doing a preemptive strike on his own citizens here, saying if you do [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=334.28s)]
*  anything slightly wrong in your protest of Donald Trump, we will use excessive and outrageous [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=339.1s)]
*  force against you. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=345.54s)]
*  And then DeSantis doubles down with, no, no, you're not getting it. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=346.90000000000003s)]
*  If you protest Trump or any Republicans in the state of Florida, we already passed a [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=350.14000000000004s)]
*  bill saying that drivers are allowed to kill you. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=354.74s)]
*  So I mean, and if you're mad, you're like, yeah, of course, man, you're on your car, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=358.58000000000004s)]
*  you gotta murder them, you run them over, man, right? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=363.22s)]
*  How about if it was January 6th? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=366.96000000000004s)]
*  And the January 6th crowd was around a car, were they allowed to just run over all the [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=369.24s)]
*  MAGA guys? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=375.32s)]
*  Who cares? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=376.32s)]
*  Just run them all over. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=377.32s)]
*  Who cares? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=378.32s)]
*  They're just, hey, bro, what are you doing? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=379.32000000000005s)]
*  And it's at the Capitol and they're breaking in and they're causing violence and they're [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=380.32000000000005s)]
*  attacking cops. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=382.68s)]
*  Run them all over, right? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=384.06s)]
*  Two different standards for different people. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=386.88s)]
*  Interesting, Michael. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=390.16s)]
*  Well, the thing I'm angriest about is the Brevard County Sheriff who ended his sentence [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=391.90000000000003s)]

*  You can't do that. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=396.92s)]
*  We can tell you where you can pick up your remains at. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=399.66s)]
*  That's not how you construct a sentence in English. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=402.94s)]
*  That said, it is horrendous that the stand your ground that has been poisoning Florida [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=405.26000000000005s)]

*  This is a solution in search of a problem, absolutely. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=418.4s)]
*  Catherine Levitt was saying that Gavin Newsom owns this. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=422.65999999999997s)]
*  Well, if he owns this, he owns a massive peaceful rally at which, unfortunately, some cars were [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=426.29999999999995s)]
*  burnt. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=432.29999999999995s)]

*  It's satirizing what protest is. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=437.62s)]
*  And as Cenk, you said so perfectly, not much more needs to be said except for that correction [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=440.23999999999995s)]
*  of his sentence structure. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=444.64s)]
*  The only thing that matters here is that this is free speech and this is what free speech [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=447.24s)]
*  looks like. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=451.96000000000004s)]
*  And they wanna tell you what free speech looks like, and that implicitly is not free speech. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=452.96000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, Michael, and I think Gavin Newsom actually said something to that effect that Trump is, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=458.52000000000004s)]
*  again, just creating a problem, making it seem so much worse than it actually is, and [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=463.8s)]
*  then solving it. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=468.24s)]
*  And he said something like Trump really just wants to be a Marvel hero, and so he creates [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=469.24s)]
*  the problem first. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=473.68s)]
*  He has to be the villain first. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=474.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=476.04s)]
*  He has to sleep in as a hero. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=477.06s)]
*  Yes, do you wanna see him in a cape and a tight suit? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=478.42s)]
*  I don't, no part of me wants, I mean, maybe a little bit of just curiosity, but I hate [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=481.26000000000005s)]

*  I'm so sorry, apologies. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=490.46000000000004s)]
*  Orange man, or maybe orange crush. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=492.46000000000004s)]
*  Orange crush. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=495.78000000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=496.78000000000003s)]
*  Cenk's gonna be so proud of that, that's annoying, cuz he's gonna talk about it a lot. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=497.78000000000003s)]
*  You love it, don't you? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD22ilik6s&t=501.42s)]
