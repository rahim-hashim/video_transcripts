# Courts PUMP THE BRAKES On Trump's Disastrous Trade War
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [May 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY)
*  Investors reacting to a federal trade court ruling against President Trump's sweeping [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=0.0s)]
*  tariffs. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=4.68s)]
*  The judge is citing a lack of authority to implement them. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=5.8s)]
*  What this really shows is that the global deep state is real, this legal deep state. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=8.68s)]
*  This is their last line of defense. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=13.24s)]
*  We have these unelected judges who are trying to force their own will when it comes to tax [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=15.0s)]
*  policy, trade policy. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=20.2s)]
*  And really, this shows the battle, Maria, that we're in between American sovereignty [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=21.96s)]
*  and having the globalist takeover. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=26.560000000000002s)]
*  Yes, Jason Miller, it turns out that in the American political system, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=30.36s)]
*  there are in fact some brakes on the car. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=34.4s)]
*  And it appears that the courts have now weighed in on Donald Trump's announcement [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=36.8s)]
*  on Liberation Day, right? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=42.32s)]
*  The announcement of this widespread trade war that he intended to engage in with a lot [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=44.08s)]
*  of our trade partners, a lot of our allies. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=50.84s)]
*  Then he kind of reneges or temporarily pauses some of these far ranging tariffs and [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=55.16s)]
*  says that he's going to engage in negotiations to get better terms for [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=59.839999999999996s)]
*  the American people and US based companies. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=63.879999999999995s)]
*  Look, it's been pretty chaotic. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=68.08s)]
*  And as I've said many times before, I'm not necessarily against [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=70.24s)]
*  targeted tariffs if they're well thought out and [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=74.4s)]
*  doesn't actually end up hurting Americans through inflation. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=77.6s)]
*  However, a three judge panel on the Court of International Trade, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=82.60000000000001s)]
*  I bet you didn't even know that court existed, but it does. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=86.72s)]
*  The Court of International Trade has dealt a severe blow to the Trump [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=90.24000000000001s)]
*  administration's trade wars. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=94.32000000000001s)]
*  They made a ruling that was announced last night, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=96.48s)]
*  essentially blocking the implementation of his sweeping tariffs. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=99.4s)]
*  However, an appeals court later weighed in and [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=103.16s)]
*  already temporarily paused the ruling by the court. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=107.48s)]
*  Court of International Trade. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=112.56s)]
*  But before we give you the details of that, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=114.56s)]
*  I want to get to the original decision first, okay? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=117.12s)]
*  So this is the original decision coming from the Court of International Trade. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=120.56s)]
*  So here's the court's reasoning. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=125.16s)]
*  Trump had used the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to enact [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=127.44s)]
*  these so called Liberation Day tariffs. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=133.68s)]
*  Now the 1977 law does grant the president emergency powers over the economy. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=137.44s)]
*  Trump pointed to the trade deficit that the United States has run each year [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=144.64000000000001s)]
*  since 1975 as the emergency justifying his sweeping tariffs. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=150.24s)]
*  And his citation of this Emergency Economic Powers Act in order to be able to [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=155.76s)]
*  implement those sweeping tariffs. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=160.28s)]
*  Now we also cited illegal immigration and [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=162.96s)]
*  fentanyl trafficking to justify additional tariffs on some of our closest [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=165.72s)]
*  trade partners including Canada, Mexico and yes, China as well. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=170.2s)]
*  But the judges, one of whom by the way is a Trump appointee, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=174.35999999999999s)]
*  did not agree that the law applied in this instance, okay? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=178.56s)]
*  The Emergency Economic Powers Act does not apply in this instance. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=183.07999999999998s)]
*  So the court noted that the IEEPA says the president may only use his emergency [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=187.64s)]
*  powers to deal with an unusual and extraordinary threat with respect to [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=192.88s)]
*  which a national emergency has been declared. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=197.64000000000001s)]
*  So Trump would turn around and say, well, there has been a national emergency, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=200.84s)]
*  the fentanyl and the drug trafficking and the trade deficit. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=205.72s)]
*  I think the trade deficit is an emergency, that's what he would argue. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=209.8s)]
*  But the court's not buying that. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=213.8s)]
*  They also said the law didn't give him unlimited power to levy tariffs. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=215.48000000000002s)]
*  The president's assertion of tariff making authority in the instant case, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=221.0s)]
*  unbounded as it is by any limitation in duration or scope, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=226.4s)]
*  exceeds any tariff authority delegated to the president under IEEPA. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=231.0s)]
*  The worldwide and retaliatory tariffs are thus contrary to law. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=236.96s)]
*  So that was their argument and their reasoning. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=242.44s)]
*  And look, I gotta say, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=245.4s)]
*  it's just the way Trump has gone about these tariffs and [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=247.12s)]
*  the way he just kind of pulls back and then threatens the tariffs again, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=250.92000000000002s)]
*  then pulls back and then threatens them again. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=255.64000000000001s)]
*  It just feels as though there's some market manipulation going on. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=259.04s)]
*  When you have the President of the United States essentially telling people, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=263.36s)]
*  hey, might be a good time to buy stocks. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=268.28000000000003s)]
*  And I get that people love that because if you're going to buy stocks, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=270.92s)]
*  people love that because if you trust the president and [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=275.24s)]
*  you decided to take his advice and buy stocks the last time he told you to buy [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=278.71999999999997s)]
*  stocks, well, you made some money in the stock market. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=283.24s)]
*  So I get people who are like, Anna, just let him do what he's doing, let him cook. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=285.96s)]
*  No, I don't want to let him cook. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=291.24s)]
*  That's not okay. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=292.4s)]
*  Okay, manipulating the markets in that way opens up a can of worms that we should [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=293.4s)]
*  all be super uncomfortable with. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=297.08s)]
*  And so that really made me question whether Trump is really worried [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=300.24s)]
*  about the trade deficit or if he sees this as an opportunity to engage in market [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=305.12s)]
*  manipulation and essentially maybe even do some pump and dump schemes that [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=309.08s)]
*  obviously I'm very much against. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=315.12s)]
*  Now, the judge has said that the Constitution gives Congress, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=316.68s)]
*  not the President, the authority to impose tariffs under most circumstances. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=321.28000000000003s)]
*  So look, Trump did do targeted tariffs in his first term. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=326.56s)]
*  And look, for the most part, there were some issues with those tariffs. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=330.08s)]
*  American farmers were harmed to some extent, which is why Trump took the revenue [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=335.44s)]
*  that the federal government raised through those tariffs and [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=340.71999999999997s)]
*  helped to subsidize our farmers. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=344.68s)]
*  So there were some issues with those tariffs. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=347.64s)]
*  However, on the whole, the targeted tariffs toward China were [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=349.52s)]
*  actually very successful. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=353.64s)]
*  The Biden administration kept them in place and even expanded upon them. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=356.88s)]
*  So those targeted tariffs did not run up against the courts at all. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=360.56s)]
*  What he's doing now with these wide ranging sweeping tariffs, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=365.0s)]
*  obviously according to this court, brings up a pretty big problem and [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=369.47999999999996s)]
*  he doesn't have the power to unilaterally do this. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=373.79999999999995s)]
*  You would need Congress to weigh in. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=376.59999999999997s)]
*  And they argued that the limited conditions that would allow Trump to act [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=379.24s)]
*  alone had not been met, okay? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=383.0s)]
*  So the court also shot down Trump's justification for [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=385.71999999999997s)]
*  implementing tariffs as a result of fentanyl trafficking, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=389.12s)]
*  which was that the tariffs will create leverage to get other countries [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=394.08000000000004s)]
*  to crack down on the drug trade. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=399.36s)]
*  So the ingredients for the fentanyl that's sweeping across the country and [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=402.8s)]
*  causing a lot of damage, well, it's sourced from China. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=407.48s)]
*  The drug is made in Mexico and then I guess brought across the border. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=411.44s)]
*  That's the argument that the Trump administration is making. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=417.04s)]
*  But under IEEPA, the judges wrote, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=420.56s)]
*  the tariff must directly deal with the emergency a president [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=422.96000000000004s)]
*  cites when imposing the tariff. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=426.96000000000004s)]
*  The fentanyl tariffs do not directly address the drug trade, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=429.84000000000003s)]
*  the judges wrote, but instead merely attempt to create economic pressure [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=433.96000000000004s)]
*  within other countries. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=438.16s)]
*  And it also feels as though after he made his announcement on Liberation Day, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=440.08000000000004s)]
*  he just tried to justify those sweeping tariffs after the fact by [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=444.36s)]
*  throwing anything he could at the wall. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=448.8s)]
*  It's the fentanyl. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=451.24s)]
*  It's the trade deficit. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=453.56s)]
*  To be fair, he's complained about the trade deficit from the jump. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=454.64s)]
*  But it just seemed like he tried to use things like the drug trade to make [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=457.8s)]
*  justifications for his sweeping tariffs after the fact. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=462.8s)]
*  Now, the decision was issued across two cases. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=467.88s)]
*  So one was filed by a group of small businesses, which obviously [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=471.76000000000005s)]
*  are going to be hurt if these tariffs are enacted. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=476.56s)]
*  Because a lot of what they sell at their stores or some of the parts they need for [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=480.12s)]
*  what they manufacture comes from foreign countries. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=484.68s)]
*  Another was a case that was filed by 12 Democratic attorneys general. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=488.44000000000005s)]
*  So what the ruling applies to is what we should talk about next because the trade [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=494.28000000000003s)]
*  decision applies to the reciprocal 10% tariffs that Trump imposed on all [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=498.68s)]
*  foreign products, which is a big deal, by the way. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=503.64s)]
*  The fact that the court struck that down is a huge deal. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=507.76s)]
*  And the additional tariffs he imposed on China, Mexico and Canada, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=510.71999999999997s)]
*  those were also impacted by this court's ruling. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=514.8s)]
*  Other targeted tariffs on steel, aluminum and cars were imposed under [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=518.6s)]
*  a separate law, okay, not the emergency law, separate law. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=524.28s)]
*  And therefore will remain in place. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=528.4s)]
*  So it appears that the court's big issue here is the fact that in order to justify [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=531.68s)]
*  the reciprocal 10% tariffs and the additional tariffs on some of our closest [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=536.4s)]
*  trade partners, he justified it by citing this emergency act. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=540.9599999999999s)]
*  And the court is saying that emergency act just does not apply. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=546.4s)]
*  You have not made a good case for [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=549.68s)]
*  why you believe that that emergency act applies to these tariffs. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=551.68s)]
*  The White House was ordered to take measures within 10 days to remove [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=555.48s)]
*  the tariffs in order to comply with this court's ruling. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=559.2s)]
*  But the Trump administration is already fighting back. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=562.4000000000001s)]
*  The White House immediately responded by rejecting the court's authority. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=565.0s)]
*  White House spokesperson, wow, his name is Kush. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=568.9200000000001s)]
*  Kush, this DSE said in a statement, it is not for [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=572.96s)]
*  unelected judges to decide how to properly address a national emergency. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=578.7600000000001s)]
*  But Kush, he did not make a good case for a national emergency. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=583.04s)]
*  That's the point, okay? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=590.4s)]
*  It's like Michael Scott just declaring bankruptcy. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=593.32s)]
*  You don't declare bankruptcy by screaming, I declare bankruptcy, okay? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=596.76s)]
*  You have to actually, in the case of Donald Trump, you can't just say, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=601.88s)]
*  it's an emergency and therefore I get to do what I want. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=605.88s)]
*  You have to prove that there's an emergency and [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=608.8s)]
*  what you're doing applies to the emergency that you're citing. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=612.2s)]
*  And he just hasn't really done that. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=616.8s)]
*  But let's put that quote back up. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=620.2s)]
*  Let's hear more from Kush who says, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=621.72s)]
*  President Trump pledged to put America first and [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=623.24s)]
*  the administration is committed to using every lever of executive power to address [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=625.6s)]
*  this crisis and restore American greatness. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=630.04s)]
*  Okay, so that statement doesn't really tell you anything, but [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=633.68s)]
*  let's just repeat a common talking point that you will hear from Trump's defenders [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=637.24s)]
*  about how these are unelected judges. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=642.24s)]
*  Okay, these are federal judges who are appointed by elected presidents and [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=646.32s)]
*  confirmed by the Senate. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=649.76s)]
*  And we have a system of government in which you don't have a king that gets to [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=652.0400000000001s)]
*  do everything he wants to do unilaterally. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=656.4000000000001s)]
*  We have a system of checks and balances, which I would venture to say, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=658.96s)]
*  the right wingers who defend Trump and say that he should just ignore the judges. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=663.64s)]
*  They probably won't say the same thing if you have a Democrat in the White House [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=669.0s)]
*  who tries to unilaterally abuse his power the way that you're seeing right now with [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=673.8000000000001s)]
*  the Trump administration in regard to these far reaching tariffs. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=678.4s)]
*  Now the Department of Justice on Thursday requested a stay, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=683.64s)]
*  saying it's needed to avoid immediate irreparable harm to United States foreign [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=687.76s)]
*  policy and national security. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=692.7199999999999s)]
*  And this afternoon a federal appeals court did agree to temporarily pause [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=694.8s)]
*  the ruling until at least June 9th. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=699.8s)]
*  So the court ordered that both sides provide written arguments on the question [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=703.4399999999999s)]
*  of blocking Trump's tariffs. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=708.4799999999999s)]
*  And it is possible that the case could end up before the Supreme Court. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=710.4399999999999s)]
*  I'm very curious to see what would happen if it does actually land in [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=714.0s)]
*  the Supreme Court. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=718.7199999999999s)]
*  Now remember, the Supreme Court has ruled against Trump previously. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=719.8s)]
*  They ruled against Donald Trump in regard to his unlawful deportation of [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=724.0799999999999s)]
*  Abrego Garcia. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=729.56s)]
*  And they said that he needs to facilitate his return back to the United States. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=731.28s)]
*  And one thing that I know for sure when it comes to this Supreme Court is yes, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=736.52s)]
*  it definitely is slanted as socially conservative. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=741.28s)]
*  But this is also a very pro corporate Supreme Court. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=746.04s)]
*  I mean, the Federalist Society, which handpicks the conservative justices and [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=750.0799999999999s)]
*  recommends them to a Republican president, as they did with Donald Trump. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=754.4399999999999s)]
*  First and foremost, look for candidates who would be very much in favor [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=758.8s)]
*  of protecting corporate interests above anything else. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=763.52s)]
*  And so in this case, these tariffs obviously would hurt some US based [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=767.36s)]
*  corporations that would rely on cheap labor abroad or [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=772.0799999999999s)]
*  would need to import parts for products they manufacture here in the United States. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=775.36s)]
*  So I wouldn't be surprised if the Supreme Court ruled against him in this case, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=781.8399999999999s)]
*  if it does in fact make its way to the Supreme Court. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=786.04s)]
*  And while the trade courts ruling was certainly a major blow to Trump's [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=789.68s)]
*  signature policies, there are other routes for him to take to pursue these tariffs. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=793.16s)]
*  So various other laws do grant the president power to intervene on trade [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=798.92s)]
*  policy, though in a slower and more limited way. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=803.88s)]
*  And one thing we know about Trump is he's not interested in slower or more limited. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=807.9599999999999s)]
*  He just wants to go full steam ahead without really thinking much about [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=812.16s)]
*  the consequences or ramifications of what he's doing. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=815.52s)]
*  Now it sounds like good news, but Trump has various other mechanisms to invoke [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=818.7199999999999s)]
*  tariffs or have leverage in trade negotiations. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=822.8399999999999s)]
*  It's just the speed of their rollout will be weeks slash months rather than [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=826.5999999999999s)]
*  immediately as he did with the IEEPA, that's the Emergency Act. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=831.9599999999999s)]
*  Now, Trump did freak out at reporters on this issue. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=836.76s)]
*  So he's been having a rough week when it comes to trade policy. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=841.92s)]
*  And the court's decision barring his tariffs from going into effect comes one [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=845.4799999999999s)]
*  day after reporter basically triggered Trump by asking him about [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=849.56s)]
*  Wall Street's reaction to his policies. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=853.7199999999999s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=856.2s)]
*  Mr. President, Wall Street analysts have coined a new term called the taco trade. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=858.2s)]
*  They're saying Trump always chickens out on your tariff threats, and [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=861.6400000000001s)]
*  that's why markets are higher this week. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=864.9200000000001s)]
*  What's your response to that? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=866.8000000000001s)]
*  I kick out? [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=868.0s)]
*  Chicken out. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=869.08s)]
*  Chicken out, I've never heard that. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=871.6s)]
*  You mean because I reduced China from 145% that I set down to 100 and [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=873.2s)]
*  then down to another number and I said you have to open up your whole country. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=879.12s)]
*  And because I gave the European Union a 50% tax tariff, and they called up and [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=883.28s)]
*  they said, please, let's meet right now, please, let's meet right now. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=888.28s)]
*  You call that chickening out? [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=896.64s)]
*  Six months ago, this country was stone cold dead. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=898.12s)]
*  We had a dead country. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=901.88s)]
*  We had a country people didn't think it was going to survive and [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=903.12s)]
*  you ask a nasty question like that. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=905.52s)]
*  It's called negotiation, but don't ever say what you said. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=908.72s)]
*  That's a nasty question. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=912.24s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=913.5600000000001s)]
*  To me, that's the nastiest question. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=914.64s)]
*  You heard it here first, folks. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=918.04s)]
*  Up until recently, this country was stone cold dead. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=920.76s)]
*  I don't even know what that means. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=926.5600000000001s)]
*  But look, I want to understand the people over at Wall Street [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=927.84s)]
*  that are accusing Trump of being a chicken, what do you want? [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=933.36s)]
*  Are you trying to goad the guy into being even more extreme in his trade policies? [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=938.36s)]
*  Which obviously hurts the stock market. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=944.52s)]
*  I don't get it. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=947.92s)]
*  I get that people want to insult Trump. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=949.36s)]
*  That's really what's behind calling him a chicken. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=952.0s)]
*  But did they maybe consider that by calling him chicken and [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=955.28s)]
*  clowning on him for pulling back on some of his trade policies, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=959.16s)]
*  that would maybe encourage him to double down, triple down, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=963.36s)]
*  do things that are even more extreme? [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=966.52s)]
*  What are you guys doing? [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=968.04s)]
*  And look, I think tariffs should be considered in some cases, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=970.3199999999999s)]
*  in some instances. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=974.8399999999999s)]
*  But now, because of the chaos of this whole situation, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=975.9599999999999s)]
*  I've said this before, I'll say it again. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=978.9599999999999s)]
*  It has soured pretty much every American on the whole notion of tariffs. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=981.4s)]
*  Except for maybe Trump's closest allies, his biggest offenders, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=986.76s)]
*  who would turn around and trash tariffs if Trump did the same. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=990.56s)]
*  But for people who might have been a little more open minded toward [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=995.8s)]
*  targeted tariffs, not anymore, right? [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=999.1999999999999s)]
*  Because it's left a very sour taste in people's mouths, [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=1001.4s)]
*  a bitter taste in people's mouths. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=1004.92s)]
*  Because of how chaotic this has all been, because of the uncertainty of [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=1006.76s)]
*  the economic consequences of it, it's just dumb. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=1010.5999999999999s)]
*  I just wish that he was more targeted, a little smarter about this, and [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=1014.52s)]
*  approach this in a more strategic way, kind of similar to what he did in [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=1018.7199999999999s)]
*  his first term. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=1022.88s)]
*  But obviously, that wasn't the case in the second term. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=1023.5600000000001s)]
*  So there you have it. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=1026.48s)]
*  We'll tell you how the story develops. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=1027.92s)]
*  But for now, there is a temporary stay on that court's decision to block [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=1029.52s)]
*  Trump's tariff policies. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=1034.04s)]
*  We're going to find out in early June how the Trump administration is going to [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=1035.68s)]
*  proceed based on what the courts decide. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=1040.28s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below, an angel gets his wings. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=1042.8s)]
*  Totally not true, but it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwdg3CakCEY&t=1045.92s)]
