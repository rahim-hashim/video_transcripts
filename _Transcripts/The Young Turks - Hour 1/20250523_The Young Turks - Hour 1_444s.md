Phillips made the remarks during an appearance on Wednesday‚Äôs News Not Noise with Jessica Yellin podcast."

TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful.

We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

# Dean Phillips Makes A WILDLY ACCURATE Comparison of MSNBC And Fox News
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [May 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E)
*  I'm not gonna use names here, but I've had confirmation that the minute that I announced [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=0.0s)]
*  my campaign in the primary, which was not aggressive, I didn't receive a single invitation [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  from MSNBC any longer, despite being the ranking member of the Middle East Subcommittee on [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=10.16s)]
*  Foreign Affairs, a regular guest on various MSNBC shows, not a single invitation. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  Former Democratic congressman and primary challenger to Joe Biden, Dean Phillips, had [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  some harsh words for MSNBC this week, and even claimed to have been blacklisted from [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=25.92s)]
*  the network. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=30.64s)]
*  Cenk, you used to be a host on MSNBC and have spoken out against them and their treatment [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=31.64s)]
*  of you in the past. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=37.68s)]
*  What are your initial thoughts here? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=39.24s)]
*  Well, I can confirm I am definitely blacklisted at MSNBC. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=40.72s)]
*  And so MSNBC does have a blacklist. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  And I'm positive that Dean Phillips was on it, because MSNBC at this point is nothing [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=48.660000000000004s)]
*  but propaganda, not for Democrats, but for Democratic leaders, Democratic politicians [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=53.6s)]
*  at the top, the Democratic establishment. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=60.120000000000005s)]
*  If you are a Democrat like Bernie Sanders, they'll rip your face off. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=62.88s)]
*  They'll call you everything in the world, they'll imply your race, sex, etc., right? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=68.0s)]
*  But if you're Dean Phillips and you're challenging Joe Biden, persona non grata, blacklisted. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=72.62s)]
*  So that's not journalism, it's not even close, it's not news. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=77.8s)]
*  So if MSNBC says, look guys, we're just doing propaganda for corporate Democrats, then I [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=82.36s)]
*  can live with it, no problem, at least truth in advertising. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=86.84s)]
*  And obviously we ban anyone who dares challenge them. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=89.88s)]
*  Even Dean Phillips, who is not really a progressive at all, right? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=93.03999999999999s)]
*  He's a moderate Democrat in Congress. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=97.08s)]
*  We'll even ban him, okay? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=101.2s)]
*  So just say it, just admit it. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=103.56s)]
*  By the way, MSNBC, are you gonna answer him or are you not gonna answer him? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=105.12s)]
*  Was he banned or was he not banned? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=108.72s)]
*  You know he was banned. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=110.76s)]
*  You know I'm banned. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=112.08s)]
*  No, no, we're the elites, we're MSNBC. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=113.08s)]
*  We don't have to answer anyone. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=117.28s)]
*  Well, all right, enjoy your ratings. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  During an appearance on Jessica Yellen's News Not Noise podcast, the former Minnesota Democrat [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=121.64s)]
*  called out MSNBC for being the media arm of the DNC. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=126.64s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=130.88s)]
*  I was one of the Democrats that for years just saw Fox News as a mechanism of the Republican [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=131.88s)]
*  Party, right? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=137.0s)]
*  As the media division of the RNC, if you will. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=138.0s)]
*  Little did I know that MSNBC is exactly the same, probably, frankly, even more directly [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=142.64s)]
*  tied. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=148.8s)]
*  If you look at the talent and management at MSNBC, Obama alums, Biden alums, there's a [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=149.8s)]
*  revolving door. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=157.72s)]
*  Members of Congress become consultants, I mean, start to become lobbyists, and former [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=159.24s)]
*  administration members go on to media. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=163.92000000000002s)]
*  Look at Jen Psaki. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=166.08s)]
*  You can just look down the list. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=167.32s)]
*  The minute that I announced my campaign in the primary, which was not aggressive, I didn't [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=168.32s)]
*  receive a single invitation from MSNBC any longer, despite being the ranking member of [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=174.6s)]
*  the Middle East Subcommittee on Foreign Affairs, a regular guest on various MSNBC shows. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=178.72s)]
*  Not a single invitation until the morning after the South Carolina primary, which was [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=184.44s)]
*  by design. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=189.0s)]
*  That was Joe Biden's strong turf, and I was relentlessly attacked that next morning. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=190.0s)]
*  Dean Phillips told Politico in January of last year he was being blackballed by MSNBC [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=196.72s)]
*  specifically. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=202.08s)]
*  I'm appalled, I'm disappointed, I'm disgusted that professionals who ostensibly have committed [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=203.08s)]
*  their entire careers to sharing truth and to providing facts and to sharing information [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=207.74s)]
*  with American voters are fundamentally avoiding the responsibilities. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=212.36s)]
*  Right media has been more than invitational. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=216.92000000000002s)]
*  I don't think there's an MSNBC viewer that even knows that I'm a congressman, because [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=219.16s)]
*  what's being portrayed is designed to prevent that education. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=223.36s)]
*  He added, I do know of specific cases representatives of the Biden campaign have been very clear [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=228.0s)]
*  to others about trying to not attend events of mine, to not support me and to not platform [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=232.84s)]
*  me. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=238.44000000000003s)]
*  It's almost antithetical to democratic principles, which include debate, deliberation, and ultimately [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=239.44000000000003s)]
*  compromise. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=244.32000000000002s)]
*  And when the Biden team was confronted by Politico with those rumors, a campaign spokesperson [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=245.32000000000002s)]
*  just replied with quote, LOL. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=251.07999999999998s)]
*  Now, Jackson, before we wrap, let's bring you in here. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=254.07999999999998s)]
*  What do you make of what Dean Phillips is saying here? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=257.12s)]
*  I mean, it's the truth. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=260.28s)]
*  And just in general, I mean, think about like right after the election and how news outlets, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=262.24s)]
*  whether it's the Washington Post, MSNBC, the people that they ended up letting go, or what [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=267.68s)]
*  was denied like in the LA Times, different types of articles. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=274.2s)]
*  You can't write these because it challenges the administration in some form or fashion. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=278.12s)]
*  On the one hand, the assumption that as they were saying, we have a mandate, which of course [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=283.56s)]
*  they don't have a mandate. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=288.2s)]
*  But that, well, this is what all of Americans want. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=289.85999999999996s)]
*  So let's go ahead and just get in line. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=292.2s)]
*  But also, them just bending the knee and kissing Trump's behind because they know that that [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=293.88s)]
*  could get them favor. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=299.08s)]
*  But also, that's the only way that they can have access to interviewing him in any capacity. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=300.44s)]
*  I mean, look at the press room. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=305.71999999999997s)]
*  They got these right wing online news shows in there. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=308.88s)]
*  And more and more, they just don't want to be questioned or challenged in any way. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=314.96s)]
*  So they're just capitulating as much as possible. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=318.52s)]
*  And there's no denying it whatsoever. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=322.03999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=324.24s)]
*  So a telling quote in there was, he said, their viewers probably don't even know that [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=325.24s)]
*  I'm a Democratic congressman. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=331.32s)]
*  That's not by accident. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=333.14s)]
*  They make everyone who runs in a primary against a corporate Democrat seem like they're [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=334.72s)]
*  a Republican. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=339.8s)]
*  A great example of it was Nina Turner's running in Cleveland. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=340.8s)]
*  She's running against Chantal Brown. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=345.36s)]
*  She has a huge lead, by the way. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=347.24s)]
*  Then APAC and crypto bros come in and start spending $4 million against her. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=348.84000000000003s)]
*  But that wasn't her main problem. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=353.92s)]
*  Her main problem is mainstream media. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=355.52000000000004s)]
*  Because mainstream media took her quote where she said, voting for Biden's like eating a [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=357.84000000000003s)]
*  half full of crap. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=362.44s)]
*  A half full bowl of crap. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=364.12s)]
*  Voting for Trump is like eating a completely full bowl of crap, right? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=367.28s)]
*  So Trump is twice as bad, definitely worse, an entire bowl of crap, right? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=373.68s)]
*  The media never said the second part. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=380.0s)]
*  They only said the first part. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=383.28s)]
*  Nina Turner says voting for Biden is like eating half a bowl of crap. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=384.88s)]
*  And every time they implied she was a Republican. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=389.42s)]
*  When I ran for Congress, you should see the New York Times, L.A. Times, CNN articles. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZxdj3vc9E&t=392.22s)]
