"The Trump administration is enmeshed in a long and rapidly growing list of legal challenges to the novel powers it has claimed for itself. But to try to understand the situation in terms of the individual cases, and the legal questions they implicate, is to miss the forest for the trees. The larger picture is that Donald Trump refuses, or is simply unable, to grasp any distinction between the law and his own whims."*

The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

What does it mean to be a ‚ÄúYoung Turk?‚Äù

According to the American Heritage Dictionary;
1. Young progressive or insurgent member of an institution, movement, or political party. 
2. Young person who rebels against authority or societal expectations.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

# Maine's Governor Stands Up To Trump, "See You In Court"
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [February 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI)
*  Donald Trump has now quoted Napoleon, declared himself on social media to be a king. And in [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=0.0s)]
*  the clip that you're about to watch, he has a little bit of a judge dread moment. Take a look. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  The NCAA has complied immediately by the way, that's good. But I understand Maine, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=8.8s)]
*  is the main here, the governor of Maine? Are you not gonna comply with it? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  I'm complying with state and federal laws. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=20.88s)]
*  All right, well, we are the federal law. Well, you better do it. You better do it [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=22.96s)]
*  because you're not gonna get any federal funding at all if you don't. And by the way, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=27.44s)]
*  your population, even though it's somewhat liberal, although I did very well there, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=30.720000000000002s)]
*  your population doesn't want men playing in women's sports. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=34.88s)]
*  So you better comply because otherwise you're not getting any federal funding. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  I'll see you in court. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=43.28s)]
*  Every state, good, I'll see you in court. I look forward to that. That should be a real easy one. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=44.16s)]
*  And enjoy your life after governor because I don't think you'll be in elected politics. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=50.0s)]
*  Okay, so some pretty clear threats there against a main Democratic governor, Janet Mills. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  He's doing the threatening just on TV at a governor's dinner now is not behind closed [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=59.440000000000005s)]
*  doors. Evidently, she doesn't have any like pending bribery lawsuits against her that he [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=65.68s)]
*  can use as a weapon to cow her into submission. So he's threatening her in public. And I have [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=70.16s)]
*  thoughts about this and I'll provide them. But Cenk, this definitely seems like an escalation [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=76.32000000000001s)]
*  for him. What do you think? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=79.92s)]
*  Yeah, no, this is the stuff I don't mind. So if I was ever in a position [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=81.12s)]
*  to make a difference, I would bully the living crap out of other politicians to get [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=88.24000000000001s)]
*  policy passed for the American people. Now, of course, for Donald Trump, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=93.2s)]
*  he cares less about that and a lot more about providing for his donors, providing for himself, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=96.48s)]
*  etc. But I also like the governor, Janet Mills fought back. God damn right, I'll see you in court. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=101.2s)]
*  There's no need to be a coward here. If he's punching, you punch back. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=107.52000000000001s)]
*  Period. The part that I hate is threatening the people of Maine or any other state, blue, red, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=111.12s)]
*  or otherwise. If your governor doesn't kiss my ass or do what I want, then I'm gonna take money [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=116.56s)]
*  away from you, honest citizens of Maine who didn't do anything wrong. And so, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=122.32000000000001s)]
*  like the underlying stuff and what he's driving at, I don't agree with. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=131.12s)]
*  But stylistically, I know it bothers a lot of people, but that's what you need to do to [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=134.8s)]
*  get stuff done. I just wish that he would get positive stuff done instead of negative stuff. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=139.28s)]
*  Yeah, super fast. For me, the fact that he's in general threatening is not the thing that [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=143.92s)]
*  particularly bothers me. I mean, I would certainly hold my public threatening of a governor for [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=149.6s)]
*  something that actually affects a lot of people's lives, something about the economy or something [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=154.56s)]
*  like that. The issue for me is, she's saying we're gonna follow state and federal law because there [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=158.32s)]
*  are challenges to this. It's gonna go up probably to the Supreme Court. And so she's saying, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=163.84s)]
*  we're gonna follow what the judges say. And his response is, we're the federal law. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=168.96s)]
*  And we already know he's now openly defying what judges have told. That's the part of this story [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=174.24s)]
*  that particularly bothers me. Mostly the authoritarian bent of it and then a little [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=179.52s)]
*  bit of the prioritization. Because I just wanna remind everyone in terms of the stakes of all [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=183.68s)]
*  this. According to NCAA president Charlie Baker, out of over 500,000 student athletes attending [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=188.24s)]
*  NCAA schools, fewer than 10 are transgender. Which means that if you wanted to in any article [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=195.36s)]
*  about trans NCAA players, you could just list all of them. You could profile everyone who's affected [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=203.60000000000002s)]
*  by this in each article about it. Just to remind everyone what the president is threatening a [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=211.04000000000002s)]
*  governor over to pull all of the funding out of a state. It's to stop these 10 players from [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=217.28000000000003s)]
*  participating in sports. So obviously the stakes are as high as they can be, right? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=223.04s)]
*  I love this. I love this. This is let the states decide until I say you can't decide on something. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=226.07999999999998s)]
*  Whether it's abortion, whether it's him intervening in New York and the congestion [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=235.51999999999998s)]
*  pricing he wants. This is all a state's right thing. They want state's rights. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=241.68s)]
*  And now they're getting pushed back from governors. They're going to get it from other states too. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=248.32s)]
*  We have a long four years in front of us. This is just the beginning of the tests of federalism that [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=254.16s)]
*  are all gonna wind up in the Supreme Court where they have to decide how much power this guy has [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=259.92s)]
*  inside of states to essentially determine their lives. And I love that this Maynard is pushing [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=266.48s)]
*  back. I know people in Maine, they're tough. They're just common sense tough people. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=275.6s)]
*  They don't like to be bullied even though a lot of the guys have women's names. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=282.0s)]
*  I think that they're, I mean, there's a lot of, they do. It's just a fact. Guys, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=286.8s)]
*  so Shirley, I know Shirley there, it's a guy. And I know Leslie and it's a main thing. I don't know [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=292.48s)]
*  what's happening, but don't mess with the Maynards. But this is, I mean, I wanna see, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=297.52000000000004s)]
*  I think we're past this point anymore where, yeah, jank stylistically, it's uncomfortable, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=303.6s)]
*  but this is where we're at now where states and the governors and leaderships are going to have [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=310.08000000000004s)]
*  to test him every time he decides I am the law, I am the king. I say what goes, that's where we're [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=315.36s)]
*  at. And it's all going to the courts. Yeah, look, let me agree with John and Brian 100% on that. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=323.76s)]
*  So first, the most important issue here, John is absolutely right is when he says I am the federal [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=331.36s)]
*  law. No, there is no one in this country that is the law. That's not how our system is built. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=336.72s)]
*  Our constitution says there are three co-equal branches of government and they work together [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=342.64s)]
*  to create the law. Congress passes the law, first of all. So in the beginning, the president doesn't [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=347.52000000000004s)]
*  even have anything to do with it. He does have to sign the law into effect and he has to execute [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=352.32s)]
*  the law. That is his role and it's a really important role and the largest role, but it is [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=356.56s)]
*  not the sole role. So when the courts say you cannot do something, if you say I will, then we [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=361.6s)]
*  don't have the co-equal branches of government. We don't have our system. We literally don't have [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=367.12s)]
*  the constitution anymore. He would make it null and void if he says the executive doesn't have [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=373.04s)]
*  to listen to the courts. Because if you don't have to listen to the courts, you can do literally [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=378.08s)]
*  anything you want. And you say, well, you killed that guy, I'm gonna bring you to court. Good news, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=381.6s)]
*  I'm not listening to the courts. So I'm totally and utterly lawless. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=386.0s)]
*  And Trump has wanted that all along. I mean, we've documented dozens of times where he's like, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=391.68s)]
*  Joe, I want you to get North Korea. Everybody stands up for Kim Jong-un, it's beautiful. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=396.56s)]
*  It's like great and everybody always applauds everything he says yes, because he would murder [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=400.56s)]
*  them if they didn't. That's the part you're living out, right? So totally unacceptable, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=404.16s)]
*  totally un-American. And guys, the underlying issues, if you're a conservative, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=409.52s)]
*  this is not the way to do it. This is totally, you're going from really popular to really [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=413.92s)]
*  unpopular. Let me explain real quick. So first of all, congestion pricing, I didn't like it. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=418.56s)]
*  I think that a lot of people in New York didn't like it. If all Trump did was cancel congestion [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=423.2s)]
*  pricing, it probably would have been a fairly popular move. Whether people on the left liked [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=428.48s)]
*  it or not, whether the Democratic governor or mayor liked it, it would have been popular. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=432.4s)]
*  But he didn't leave it at that. He added, long live the king. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=436.48s)]
*  Okay, why are you talking about being the king and this thing? And Brian's right. What [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=439.52s)]
*  happened to states' rights? Conservatives the whole time like, no, states' rights, states' rights. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=444.79999999999995s)]
*  Georgia has the right to peach cobbler and to own black people. Okay, but really it's about the [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=448.79999999999995s)]
*  peach cobbler, is it? Okay, so that's what states' rights was about. Now all of a sudden when states' [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=454.79999999999995s)]
*  rights are inconvenient, nobody in Maine has any rights, nobody in New York has any rights, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=459.52s)]
*  nobody anywhere has any rights, because Donald Trump is the law, right? This is not America. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=463.52s)]
*  Okay, and John makes a point about the 10 people out of 500,000 college athletes, right? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=470.64s)]
*  But there's 330 million people in the country. So I'll piss off the right and the left, okay? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=476.64s)]
*  Those 10 people, sorry guys, it's not that important. For us to have a national conversation [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=482.56s)]
*  to threaten Maine, to threaten the constitutional order over 10 freaking people in the country. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=487.84s)]
*  And why? So why do I bring that up? Not to insult those 10 people, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=494.56s)]
*  not to insult the people who are passionate about it on either side. But because it's [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=498.08s)]
*  an obvious distraction. They got rid of all the regulators at the SEC, the IRS, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=502.4s)]
*  every other agency, the FTC, the CFPB. I'm listing all of these different agencies as my [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=511.35999999999996s)]
*  earpiece falls out. Why? Because those are the people who were the cops on Wall Street. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=518.3199999999999s)]
*  They just defunded the police on Wall Street. The bankers, crypto guys, etc. are right now [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=526.24s)]
*  making plans to just move all of the money out while you're worried about 10 trans people [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=533.04s)]
*  in college sports and the whole country's fighting over it. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=538.5600000000001s)]
*  No, focus, focus on what's important. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=542.4s)]
*  Yeah, obviously, I'm sure we have our disagreements about this. I agree that [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=545.6s)]
*  it's a distraction, but I don't want people to ever think that labeling it that means that it's [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=549.76s)]
*  not important. Something can be important, but it's still being used as a distraction. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=554.72s)]
*  I personally think just protect the people, but I would also point out [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=559.04s)]
*  Donald Trump has more billionaires in his cabinet than there are trans athletes in the NCAA. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=563.28s)]
*  Wow, that's a stat. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=570.4s)]
*  I mean, that's just something to think about. He has 30% more billionaires in his cabinet than [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=571.76s)]
*  there are trans athletes in the NCAA. So again, just something to consider. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG7_VMS1FI&t=577.04s)]
