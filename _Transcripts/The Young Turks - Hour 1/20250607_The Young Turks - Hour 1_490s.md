"After Latino voters moved toward President Donald Trump in November, a new in-depth survey of this demographic shows their support for him could be breaking, according to polling shared first with POLITICO.
Throughout the president‚Äôs first few months in office, his favorability among Latinos is crashing, especially among independents and women, according to a new poll conducted by Global Strategy Group and commissioned by Somos Votantes, a Democratic-leaning group that focuses on Latinos."

# Trump Support Is CRASHING OUT
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE)
*  We truly believe that the Republican Party platform 100% is what the Latino community [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=0.0s)]
*  needs. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  Donald Trump is gonna help the country with the economy. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=8.6s)]
*  Right now I feel kind of bad because the economy since January, January, February, March so [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=14.4s)]
*  far has really, really, really slowed the business. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=22.72s)]
*  Even Donald Trump received unprecedented levels of support from Latino voters during the 2024 [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=28.22s)]
*  presidential election. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=34.98s)]
*  After years of these voters specifically and overwhelmingly backing the Democratic Party. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=36.42s)]
*  But the support that Trump enjoyed just a few months ago seems to be waning and that's [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=43.06s)]
*  according to new data that I wanna share with you now. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=47.54s)]
*  So independents in particular are not happy with what they're seeing. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=49.980000000000004s)]
*  Independent voters in my opinion tend to be easier to sway because they're more wide eyed [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=56.1s)]
*  about both political parties and their flaws. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=63.06s)]
*  So let's take a look at this. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=64.88s)]
*  Among independents, Trump's approval rating dropped 14 points from 43% in February to [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=66.7s)]
*  29% in May. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=73.38s)]
*  And that means he's now 28 points underwater with Latino independents. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=75.58s)]
*  All right, so let's take a look at the next graph. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=81.5s)]
*  Which will show you that among all Latino voters, his approval rating has dropped from [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=84.62s)]
*  43% to 39%. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=89.54s)]
*  And that means his net approval is underwater at minus 18 points. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=92.26s)]
*  So the drop in overall approval is reflective of how Latino voters feel about Trump's handling [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=97.2s)]
*  of the economy. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=102.30000000000001s)]
*  And remember, that was the main reason why they broke with the Democrats to support Trump [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=103.30000000000001s)]
*  in the last election. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=108.46000000000001s)]
*  They felt that he would be better for the economy compared to Kamala Harris. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=109.46000000000001s)]
*  They might be regretting their decision to vote for him now. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=114.89999999999999s)]
*  So let's take a look at how they feel in regard to Trump's handling of the economy. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=117.74s)]
*  Among all Latino voters, just 38% hold a positive view. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=122.22s)]
*  So that's less than half, obviously, and that's compared to 58% who disapprove. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=127.1s)]
*  So 58% of Latino voters not happy with how Trump is handling the economy. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=133.74s)]
*  Again, those numbers are even worse among independents. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=137.9s)]
*  60% of Latino independents now disapprove of Trump's handling of the economy, putting [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=142.1s)]
*  his net approval at negative 34 points. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=148.9s)]
*  Damn. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=152.54s)]
*  Not good, very bad. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=154.06s)]
*  Yeah, I just kind of heard the big guy. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=155.06s)]
*  I guess that's a Latin X on him. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=157.34s)]
*  My God. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=159.9s)]
*  Okay, so listen guys, there's two parts of the story that I like. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=160.9s)]
*  First of all, this is a hilarious thing to say. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=166.58s)]
*  I love Latino voters. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=169.14000000000001s)]
*  You know why? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=170.66s)]
*  Because they're the most no nonsense voters. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=171.66s)]
*  Like others, they have like a million other priorities. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=174.1s)]
*  Latinos primarily vote on the economy, according to the polling. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=176.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=179.94s)]
*  Right? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=180.94s)]
*  That's not anecdotal. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=181.94s)]
*  I'm just analyzing the polling. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=182.94s)]
*  They seem to be the one demographic most laser focused on the economy, depending on what [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=184.06s)]
*  their economic outlook is. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=188.62s)]
*  That's how they vote, right? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=190.42000000000002s)]
*  And so that makes sense. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=192.02s)]
*  And that's logical, in my opinion. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=193.4s)]
*  Okay, now I hope you care about other things too. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=195.1s)]
*  But it certainly makes sense in how you view the world. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=197.78s)]
*  Okay, so the second thing that's interesting is, so hence Latinos are an excellent barometer [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=201.14000000000001s)]
*  of how you're going to do with independence, okay? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=206.9s)]
*  So and overall polling. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=212.26000000000002s)]
*  So in this case, he's losing them. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=214.5s)]
*  Why? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=219.06s)]
*  For the same exact reason that the Democrats lost them. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=220.06s)]
*  Because they're actually looking at their economy rather than your propaganda, right? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=223.06s)]
*  So the Democrats told them, Latinos, you gotta, I mean Latinx. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=227.9s)]
*  You gotta realize, we love you guys, okay? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=231.66s)]
*  And that's why we let in a lot of undocumented immigrants and Latinos are like, wait, I didn't [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=234.54s)]
*  ask for that. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=239.34s)]
*  I know. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=240.34s)]
*  Right, I asked for a better economy. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=241.34s)]
*  And yeah, I mean, there's higher inflation, Biden and his team say, but don't worry about [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=242.86s)]
*  it because Donald Trump bad. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=247.58s)]
*  And Latinos are like, I don't care. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=250.58s)]
*  The economy sucks. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=252.62s)]
*  Inflation is too high. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=254.38s)]
*  I'm voting for Trump. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=255.38s)]
*  No, but GDP, Cenk, GDP good. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=256.38s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=258.38s)]
*  That was the other argument. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=259.38s)]
*  By the way, now Trump's making the same argument. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=260.38s)]
*  He is, he is. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=261.78000000000003s)]
*  Right, and that's why he's now suffering with Latino voters. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=262.78000000000003s)]
*  Because he's now saying, I got a lot of great propaganda, okay? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=265.66s)]
*  We got the gold card. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=269.18s)]
*  We got Doge. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=270.54s)]
*  Okay, I'm doing peace. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=271.54s)]
*  I haven't done any tariffs, etc. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=273.5s)]
*  Everything's good. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=276.02s)]
*  And they're like, yeah, brother, but the economy hasn't improved at all. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=277.02s)]
*  In fact, it's gone down. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=279.34000000000003s)]
*  So where's the beef? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=281.72s)]
*  Okay, so Latino voters not impressed by the marketing of Joe Biden or Donald Trump. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=283.92s)]
*  They see the economy for what it is. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=290.48s)]
*  And I love that you can't trick them. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=292.64000000000004s)]
*  So Trump's running into the same exact iceberg that Biden ran into. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=295.20000000000005s)]
*  56% of those surveyed said that the economy is getting worse under Trump's administration. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=299.12s)]
*  Only 19% said the economy is improving. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=306.48s)]
*  Because that's true. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=309.02000000000004s)]
*  Because that's true. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=310.16s)]
*  I don't feel like he's looking out for the right people. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=311.24s)]
*  So when asked if Trump's policies are prioritizing the wealthy versus the working and middle [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=316.6s)]
*  class, nearly two thirds of Hispanic slash Latino voters continue to say Trump's policies [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=321.16s)]
*  put the wealthy first at 65%. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=326.66s)]
*  Today up from 63% in February. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=329.72s)]
*  Because that's also true. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=333.56s)]
*  Exactly, so I mean, yeah, look at the priorities in the big beautiful bill. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=334.88s)]
*  I mean, the tax breaks disproportionately benefit the highest earners. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=339.08s)]
*  Yes, there are some tax breaks that help working class people, but [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=343.52s)]
*  certainly the bulk of the tax savings go to the rich. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=347.23999999999995s)]
*  And that's on top of the fact that obviously over recent decades, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=352.64s)]
*  the tax system has overwhelmingly already benefited the rich. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=357.03999999999996s)]
*  With them having to pay a smaller percentage of their income, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=361.76s)]
*  their earnings toward the federal government as opposed to working class Americans. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=365.40000000000003s)]
*  Now the group that commissioned this poll, I want to be fair, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=370.32s)]
*  is a Democratic leaning group that focuses on Latinos. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=373.52000000000004s)]
*  But other polling, because we wanted to cross reference this, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=377.20000000000005s)]
*  we didn't want to use a biased poll. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=379.84000000000003s)]
*  So Kate Bettino, super producer, cross reference this poll with other polling. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=382.08000000000004s)]
*  And that other polling indicates similar trends and [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=387.64s)]
*  even lower approval ratings for Trump. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=390.08000000000004s)]
*  So surveys from the Pew Research Center, YouGov slash Economist, CNN and [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=392.88s)]
*  Reuters slash Ipsos put his approval among Latino voters between 27% and 34%. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=397.71999999999997s)]
*  So clearly he is in fact losing the support that he managed to gain with [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=405.12s)]
*  Latino voters in this last presidential election. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=409.79999999999995s)]
*  And it's because guess what, voters vote based on their self-interest. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=412.76s)]
*  And in this case, people broke from the Democrats to support Trump, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=417.76s)]
*  because they believed he was actually going to do good things for [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=422.68s)]
*  them when it came to economic policy. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=425.72s)]
*  So far his actions have not bared that out at all. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=428.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, and look, if you're a Trump supporter, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=431.12s)]
*  you could do the same thing as the Biden supporters did. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=433.96s)]
*  You could try to deny reality from here until the cows come home, right? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=437.36s)]
*  It's not going to work. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=442.56s)]
*  At the end of the day, you either have a good economy or you don't. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=443.48s)]
*  So proof is always in the pudding. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=446.32s)]
*  And apparently Latinos realize that quicker than anyone else does, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=448.52000000000004s)]
*  because the polling seems to indicate that more clearly. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=452.68s)]
*  By the way, and it might be because they don't get propaganda as much for media, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=455.8s)]
*  right? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=461.36s)]
*  Because right wing media will propagandize you towards Trump. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=463.20000000000005s)]
*  Mainstream media a lot of times propagandize you towards [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=466.8s)]
*  Democratic establishment. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=469.24s)]
*  Used to be the establishment of Republican and [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=470.76s)]
*  Democrats, more Democrats these days. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=472.28000000000003s)]
*  And so if you haven't watched a lot of that propaganda, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=474.6s)]
*  you just look at the economy and make a decision based on facts rather than [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=477.88s)]
*  the marketing of the two parties. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=481.59999999999997s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below, an angel gets his wings. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=483.76s)]
*  Totally not true, but it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Rp-xrx-qE&t=486.84s)]
