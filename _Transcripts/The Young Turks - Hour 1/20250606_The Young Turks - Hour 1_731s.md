More than two months after the Trump administration admitted it mistakenly deported Abrego Garcia from Maryland to his native El Salvador, a federal grand jury has indicted him for allegedly transporting undocumented migrants within the United States."

# Abrego Garcia Returns To The U.S. After Deportation To El Salvador
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc)
*  Abrego Garcia has landed in the United States to face justice. On May 21st, a grand jury [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=0.0s)]
*  in the Middle District of Tennessee returned a sealed indictment charging Abrego Garcia [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=7.68s)]
*  with alien smuggling and conspiracy to commit alien smuggling in violation of Title 8 USC [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=13.84s)]
*  1324. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=21.2s)]
*  We want to thank President Bukele for agreeing to return Abrego Garcia to the United States. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=23.1s)]
*  Our government presented El Salvador with an arrest warrant and they agreed to return [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=29.92s)]
*  him to our country. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=35.36s)]
*  So over two months ago, the Trump administration admitted that it had mistakenly deported Kilmar [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=37.52s)]
*  Abrego Garcia. Today, he has returned to the United States. And as he just heard from Attorney [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=43.96s)]
*  General Pam Bondi, he is now facing charges. So here's Bondi with more on what Garcia has [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=50.160000000000004s)]
*  actually been charged with. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=56.0s)]
*  Upon completion of his sentence, we anticipate he will be returned to his home country of [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=57.919999999999995s)]
*  El Salvador. The grand jury found that over the past nine years, Abrego Garcia has played [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=63.28s)]
*  a significant role in an alien smuggling ring. They found this was his full time job, not [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=70.92s)]
*  a contractor. He was a smuggler of humans and children and women. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=81.36s)]
*  He made over 100 trips, the grand jury found, smuggling people throughout our country. MS-13 [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=89.08s)]
*  members, violent gang terrorist organization members throughout our country. Thousands [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=98.8s)]
*  of illegal aliens were smuggled. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=108.56s)]
*  If Abrego Garcia is convicted, both crimes are punishable by up to ten years in prison. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=112.16000000000001s)]
*  Today, ABC News reported that according to sources familiar with the investigation, the [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=118.0s)]
*  criminal investigation that led to these new charges began back in April. And it has to [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=123.44s)]
*  do with a traffic stop back in Tennessee in 2022 when Abrego Garcia was pulled over for [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=128.76s)]
*  He had eight passengers in his car. So here are those details. Abrego Garcia told police [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=136.28s)]
*  they had been working construction in Missouri. According to body camera footage of the 2022 [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=142.76000000000002s)]
*  traffic stop, the Tennessee troopers after questioning Abrego Garcia discussed among [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=148.60000000000002s)]
*  themselves their suspicions that Abrego Garcia might be transporting people for money because [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=154.60000000000002s)]
*  nine people were traveling without luggage, but Abrego Garcia was not ticketed or charged. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=160.84s)]
*  Abrego Garcia was let off with a warning. This year, the Justice Department questioned the man [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=168.2s)]
*  who owned the vehicle that Abrego Garcia was driving during that traffic stop. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=173.79999999999998s)]
*  So after being granted limited immunity, the man allegedly told investigators that he previously [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=178.92s)]
*  operated a taxi service based in Baltimore. He claimed to have met Abrego Garcia around 2015 [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=185.24s)]
*  and claimed to have hired him on multiple occasions to transport undocumented migrants [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=192.28s)]
*  from Texas to various locations in the United States. When details of the Tennessee traffic [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=198.04s)]
*  stop were first publicized, Abrego Garcia's wife said her husband sometimes transported groups of [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=204.12s)]
*  fellow construction workers between job sites. The indictment alleges that Abrego Garcia picked [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=210.68s)]
*  up the migrants in Houston, Texas, and then transported them deeper into the United States. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=217.64000000000001s)]
*  So Abrego Garcia and six co-conspirators also allegedly collected financial payments from [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=223.32s)]
*  migrants for their movements according to the indictment. That money was then transferred [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=229.08s)]
*  between one another, the Justice Department said, claiming it was an effort to hide their origins. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=234.28s)]
*  So even if Abrego Garcia is found to be guilty of something, it still does not justify the actions [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=241.24s)]
*  of our government in the first place for deporting him prior to any investigation or due process or [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=246.84s)]
*  conviction. Of course, it would help with the optics as far as justifying these deportations [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=253.64000000000001s)]
*  to the people who already support and want to support these deportations. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=259.4s)]
*  To the point that they are sort of fine with flouting the constitution and not giving these [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=263.64s)]
*  people due process. So they really wanna make an example, it seems, out of Abrego Garcia to [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=267.48s)]
*  legitimize their operations to their base. But Cenk, this also might feel a little bit like an [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=271.96000000000004s)]
*  intimidation tactic as in they want Abrego Garcia to regret even coming back to this country, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=277.88s)]
*  even while he was wrongfully deported in the first place. What do you think? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=283.32s)]
*  Yeah, I think there's two important points here. One is why are they doing this, which is [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=286.68s)]
*  not being talked about in the press. Let me tell you why. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=292.44s)]
*  So there's some lawsuits about this that they wanna avoid, but that's relatively minor. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=295.15999999999997s)]
*  So the big thing is the Supreme Court told them to return Abrego Garcia, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=301.96s)]
*  but it was not the final decision. They brought it back to the lower courts and it was working its [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=308.12s)]
*  way back up the lower courts. And the lower courts were all confirming, bring him back, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=312.52s)]
*  bring him back. What they didn't want is for it to get back to the Supreme Court. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=316.36s)]
*  And for the Supreme Court to say, no, what you're doing is obviously unconstitutional, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=321.0s)]
*  and you must bring him back. They wanted to avoid that embarrassment and that loggerheads [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=325.56s)]
*  that would have put them in with the Supreme Court, which by the way, I'm glad they avoided [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=331.8s)]
*  that because then that's an actual constitutional crisis if they don't listen to a final Supreme [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=335.64s)]
*  Court decision. So that's what they were trying to avoid here. But what they don't want is, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=340.68s)]
*  we just bring him back because the courts ordered us to because Trump's ego is way too [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=346.28s)]
*  large for that and his skin is way too thin for that. So he needs a face saving gesture. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=352.28s)]
*  So yes, we're bringing him back to triumph for criminal charges. Now, one of our members, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=357.71999999999997s)]
*  Nomadic Bloom, said something that I agree with. They said, I need to see proof, but if he did the [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=363.88s)]
*  crime, he should serve the time and then in brackets in the United States. That's right. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=370.52s)]
*  If you do a crime in the US, you should serve time here and you should be brought to justice. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=375.0s)]
*  So if it was true, I would say, okay, I mean, that's fair. But now some caveats to that that [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=379.32s)]
*  are important. Look, in terms of the actual substance of what he did in transporting them, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=386.12s)]
*  I don't know and I can't make that judgment call based on what evidence we have here. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=391.32s)]
*  I'm not saying that he's definitely innocent on that. And I'm certainly not saying he's guilty [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=396.04s)]
*  on that. I don't know. So why don't we know? Number one, that person that they made the deal [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=400.12s)]
*  with that said, yeah, he was running a taxi service inside the country for undocumented [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=406.2s)]
*  immigrants. He got offered immunity for that testimony. So if you go inside a jail and you [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=411.0s)]
*  wave around immunity for Donald Trump's purposes, somebody's gonna tell you, I'm [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=416.36s)]
*  Gregor Garcia did something wrong. So, but it could be true. Well, that's what we have court [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=420.52s)]
*  system for. So I'm curious how this trial is gonna go. But I found the second piece of evidence [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=425.96s)]
*  to be very compelling, guys. ABC News reporting, and I'll quote them here, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=432.44s)]
*  the decision to pursue the indictment against Abrego Garcia led to the abrupt departure of Ben [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=437.23999999999995s)]
*  Schrader, a high ranking federal prosecutor in Tennessee. Schrader's resignation was prompted [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=442.44s)]
*  by concerns that the case was being pursued for political reasons, the sources said. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=448.84s)]
*  And Schrader's 15 years serving there and a head of the criminal division. If the head of the [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=455.56s)]
*  criminal division resigns in protest, cuz he thinks you're doing a political prosecution of [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=461.56s)]
*  someone, that's a pretty big sign that you're doing a political prosecution. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=467.56s)]
*  Brett, what do you think? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=471.88s)]
*  It's definitely like they're pretending they did nothing wrong. Did you listen to Pan Bondi? She [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=472.6s)]
*  told you the guy's been convicted by a grand jury. That's not what grand juries do. Grand juries don't [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=477.64s)]
*  say they found this person guilty of this. Grand juries listen to the evidence and say whether we [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=483.08s)]
*  should get an indictment going. Is there enough evidence for us to proceed with the process? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=487.4s)]
*  She just told you that a grand jury does what a grand jury does not do. And she does that [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=492.68s)]
*  because it's a, and now she's pretending that everything was above board and now we've really [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=499.56s)]
*  got the guy. No, they messed up. The trap here is to talk about whether Abrego Garcia did any of [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=504.2s)]
*  this. That's a trap. Cuz I don't care. That's the stuff that we're supposed to let the justice [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=512.28s)]
*  system do correctly. The crooks here are the Trump administration. The crooks here are the [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=518.8399999999999s)]
*  Trump administration that just was like, let's just throw people out of the country, regardless [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=524.12s)]
*  of whether we're giving them due process, something that is guaranteed in the Constitution of the [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=529.16s)]
*  United States. They skipped that part. They got caught for skipping that part. Every court along [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=533.3199999999999s)]
*  the way said you skipped that part. We caught you. And there's Pam Bondi being like, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=540.52s)]
*  you guys are all making a mistake. We're doing everything right and this guy's going to jail. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=546.28s)]
*  He's been convicted already. If I said something like this on that show, they would rightly sue [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=550.76s)]
*  me for it cuz he hasn't been convicted of Jack Squat yet. I can't say that unless we got a [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=555.64s)]
*  confession or a conviction. She just did that cuz she's Pam Bondi. And I know they posture like [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=560.92s)]
*  that in the court of law, but this is all text me, Pam Bondi. And the last thing I'll say is [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=565.96s)]
*  reminder, Pam Bondi is a crooked person. Pam Bondi was investigating the Donald Trump [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=570.44s)]
*  organization until they gave her $25,000. The whole story itself is comically ridiculous. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=575.5600000000001s)]
*  But the long story short is after that money went into her pocket, she stopped investigating the guy [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=583.8000000000001s)]
*  and gave a litany of what would then be proven to be false statements at worst and at best, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=589.0s)]
*  misstatements about actually what went down. But really it just turned out to be a bribe. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=596.36s)]
*  So I'm gonna quote Velvet Goldmine, who's a member on Twitch. If this isn't manufactured, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=600.84s)]
*  then why didn't they say anything about these charges when they were trying to justify his [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=607.24s)]
*  deportation in the first place? So that's a good question. They claim, well, we looked into him [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=610.68s)]
*  and golly gee, this crime popped up out of nowhere. And then we had to go find an informant who we [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=618.12s)]
*  were gonna give immunity to and let him out of jail at some point, right? And then so now, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=623.72s)]
*  we're now deeply concerned about this new crime we happen to coincidentally [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=630.36s)]
*  find to cover our tracks, but we're super concerned about it. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=635.8000000000001s)]
*  Well, maybe, but I doubt it. So look, I'm not saying again that I know how the [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=640.76s)]
*  court's gonna rule on the actual case here. But the most important point is the one bread spanking, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=648.44s)]
*  which is this isn't about one particular person, whether they did or did not do a crime. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=655.08s)]
*  And again, let me clarify one other thing about the crime. They're making it sound like he smuggled [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=660.84s)]
*  in these poor people into the country. The allegations are driving people to work. They [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=665.4s)]
*  happen to be undocumented. And so that's apparently what's the most dangerous, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=673.4s)]
*  horrible crime in the world. So we'll let the courts adjudicate that. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=678.52s)]
*  And that's the point. That's our constitutional republic, where courts decide that and not these [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=683.0s)]
*  bozos who are running roughshod over the constitution and saying, who cares about due process? [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=688.68s)]
*  Let's lock up random people. Yeah, I hate the optics of it. And I know that their base is [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=693.72s)]
*  going to say, look, see, he was a criminal all along and in their minds is going to justify [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=698.44s)]
*  everything that happened. But it simply will not because we know that this never should have [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=704.12s)]
*  happened in the first place. And no matter what they find in this investigation, whatever they [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=708.12s)]
*  end up finding, it's never going to make what they did in the first place okay. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=712.7600000000001s)]
*  And I feel like that point needs to just be emphasized until we can't say it anymore because [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=716.6800000000001s)]
*  we know how it's gonna play out. Every time you ring the bell below, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=722.36s)]
*  an angel gets his wings. Totally not true, but it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j3sSAaTvZc&t=725.64s)]
