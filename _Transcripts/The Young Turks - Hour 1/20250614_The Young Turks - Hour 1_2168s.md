TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.
The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.
On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.
Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.
Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.
TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.
TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.

# Gaza Debate Goes NUCLEAR On Piers Morgan's Show
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE)
*  You're disgusting. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=0.0s)]
*  You people disgust me. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1.0s)]
*  They confirmed it was from us. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=3.84s)]
*  And the only thing disgusting here, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=5.36s)]
*  this person is intentionally lying [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=7.34s)]
*  and blaming the IDF. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=9.3s)]
*  I can't even handle your voice. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=10.48s)]
*  It was the story that there's [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=12.64s)]
*  humanitarian aid. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  I'm an Armenian. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  I know genocide when I see it. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=16.36s)]
*  You are a defender of genocide. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=17.96s)]
*  Had a pretty uneventful morning, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=20.96s)]
*  went on Piers Morgan's show today. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=22.8s)]
*  And Emily Schrader, who I believe is [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=24.52s)]
*  a propagandist on behalf of [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=26.92s)]
*  the Israeli government, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=28.88s)]
*  triggered me. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=30.64s)]
*  I have no problem admitting that. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=31.52s)]
*  Because at this point, after now [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=33.72s)]
*  more than a year and a half of [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=36.28s)]
*  watching Palestinian civilians get [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=38.519999999999996s)]
*  bombed to death, starved to death, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=41.44s)]
*  shelled to death, I literally [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=44.5s)]
*  cannot handle hearing another [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=47.099999999999994s)]
*  Israel defender lie to my face [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=49.56s)]
*  about what's really going on. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=51.94s)]
*  Emily Schrader falls in that [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=55.56s)]
*  story of Israeli propagandists, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=57.38s)]
*  liars, who provide cover for [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=59.46s)]
*  atrocities, who provide cover for [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=61.300000000000004s)]
*  ethnic cleansing, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=63.480000000000004s)]
*  who provide cover for genocide. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=64.68s)]
*  And so yeah, I got a little heated [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=66.94s)]
*  to say the least. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=68.46000000000001s)]
*  So she's allegedly a journalist. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=69.22s)]
*  Earlier in the debate, she got [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=72.82000000000001s)]
*  challenged on the definition of [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=74.54s)]
*  a ceasefire. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=76.46000000000001s)]
*  Let's take a quick look at that. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=77.34s)]
*  It is Hamas that has rejected [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=78.9s)]
*  repeated ceasefires. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=80.30000000000001s)]
*  A pause in fighting is not [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=81.38s)]
*  a ceasefire, a pause in fighting is [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=83.14s)]
*  not a ceasefire. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=85.14s)]
*  Sick of the rebranding of [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=86.34s)]
*  a ceasefire, a two month pause in [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=87.74s)]
*  war is not a ceasefire, period, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=90.02s)]
*  end of story. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=92.25999999999999s)]
*  Go ahead Omar. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=93.42s)]
*  Then Hamas is welcome, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=94.34s)]
*  Hamas is welcome to release all of [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=95.42s)]
*  the hostages. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=97.02s)]
*  I said what I said. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=97.78s)]
*  If you release all of the hostages [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=98.38s)]
*  then we can talk about it. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=99.58s)]
*  This idea that you release [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=101.17999999999999s)]
*  the hostages and as soon as the [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=102.86s)]
*  hostages are released Israel will [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=104.34s)]
*  continue their genocide is [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=106.14s)]
*  unacceptable, unacceptable. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=107.58s)]
*  But anyway, continue. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=110.34s)]
*  You know what else is unacceptable? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=111.02s)]
*  The fact that there are more than [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=112.22s)]
*  50 hostages being held by Hamas for [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=113.3s)]
*  more than 600 years. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=114.66s)]
*  You're a vile individual. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=115.58s)]
*  I fully stand by my statement [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=117.38s)]
*  regarding Emily Schrader being [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=119.78s)]
*  a vile individual. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=122.5s)]
*  It is atrocious that you still have [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=124.38s)]
*  Israeli captives in the Gaza Strip. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=127.14s)]
*  Those hostages haven't been [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=130.58s)]
*  released, they should be released. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=132.3s)]
*  But let's just talk about this [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=134.9s)]
*  notion of a ceasefire that only [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=137.18s)]
*  lasts long enough for [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=139.58s)]
*  Hamas to release the hostages. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=141.22s)]
*  And then Israel gets to continue [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=144.06s)]
*  the atrocities they've been [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=146.02s)]
*  carrying out in the Gaza Strip. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=147.74s)]
*  And also by the way, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=150.06s)]
*  the West Bank, let's not forget [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=150.94s)]
*  about the West Bank, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=152.38s)]
*  which was not governed by Hamas. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=153.42000000000002s)]
*  Which has been dealing with [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=155.58s)]
*  the occupation of the Israelis and [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=157.5s)]
*  has dealt with settlers coming in, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=160.02s)]
*  driving Palestinians out of their [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=162.54000000000002s)]
*  legal homes. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=164.74s)]
*  You guys get the picture, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=165.98000000000002s)]
*  I've talked about this a billion [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=167.18s)]
*  times before. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=168.66s)]
*  Hamas has agreed to give up [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=169.98000000000002s)]
*  governing the Gaza Strip. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=172.18s)]
*  They have agreed to releasing [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=175.42s)]
*  the remainder of the hostages. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=177.57999999999998s)]
*  All they want is a permanent [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=179.78s)]
*  ceasefire, but [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=182.42s)]
*  Israel doesn't want a permanent [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=184.06s)]
*  ceasefire, Israel wants to steal [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=186.62s)]
*  that land. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=189.29999999999998s)]
*  They want to push out every single [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=190.38s)]
*  Palestinian that survived this war [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=192.94s)]
*  and take over. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=195.74s)]
*  They want to build settlements, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=197.78s)]
*  they announced they're going to be [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=199.29999999999998s)]
*  going to build legal settlements [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=200.9s)]
*  in the West Bank, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=202.46s)]
*  they want the land. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=203.38000000000002s)]
*  This is the greater Israel project [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=205.58s)]
*  folks, I mean, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=207.82000000000002s)]
*  they tell you what they want to do. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=208.94000000000003s)]
*  On one hand, you have the Israeli [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=212.18s)]
*  government straight up telling you [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=213.38000000000002s)]
*  what they intend to do. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=214.70000000000002s)]
*  And then for whatever reason, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=215.70000000000002s)]
*  clowns like Emily Schrader go on [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=218.18s)]
*  various American news programs to [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=220.74s)]
*  tell us that we didn't just hear [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=223.42000000000002s)]
*  what the Israeli government told us [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=225.78000000000003s)]
*  and we're not seeing what our own [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=228.26000000000002s)]
*  government is saying in the Gaza [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=230.22s)]
*  Strip in the West Bank. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=232.02s)]
*  A ceasefire means the war ends. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=233.38s)]
*  Israel doesn't want the war to end. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=235.9s)]
*  And eventually when they do get [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=238.9s)]
*  what they want, because I think [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=240.3s)]

*  they're going to get what they want. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=243.1s)]
*  They're going to take over Gaza, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=244.78s)]
*  they're going to take over [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=246.26s)]
*  the West Bank. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=247.54s)]
*  They've tried to annex parts of [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=249.38s)]
*  Lebanon, that didn't work. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=250.9s)]
*  I wouldn't be surprised if they [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=252.26s)]
*  try to do that in the future. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=253.57999999999998s)]
*  They have annexed parts of Syria [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=254.86s)]
*  already, greater Israel project. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=256.94s)]
*  We all know what this is. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=259.42s)]
*  I mean, anyone who's paying [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=260.54s)]
*  attention knows what this is. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=261.7s)]
*  But Emily Schrader thinks [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=263.06s)]

*  Emily Schrader thinks it's fun to [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=265.58000000000004s)]

*  intelligence insulted, okay? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=271.82s)]
*  Because I don't fall for propagandists [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=274.14000000000004s)]

*  Emily Schrader, there's more. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=278.14s)]
*  So Schrader also got challenged on [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=280.38s)]
*  a talking point that she made [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=282.70000000000005s)]
*  about a year earlier. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=284.54s)]
*  She was on Piers Morgan's show with [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=285.98s)]
*  Abby Martin, who's excellent on [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=288.22s)]
*  this topic, on this issue. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=290.3s)]
*  And she made a declaration about [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=292.14s)]
*  what Israel intends to do and [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=294.3s)]
*  what they will not do. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=296.06s)]
*  And she was wrong about that, so [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=298.22s)]
*  I challenged her, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=299.3s)]
*  let's take a look. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=299.90000000000003s)]
*  You were on this very show a year [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=300.90000000000003s)]
*  ago debating Abby Martin. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=302.62s)]
*  And you said, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=304.42s)]
*  you fancy yourself a journalist. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=305.1s)]
*  During that debate, you said that [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=306.74s)]
*  Israel has no interest in occupying [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=308.78000000000003s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=310.9s)]
*  Israel is now very obviously and [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=311.9s)]
*  overtly claiming they intend to [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=313.94s)]
*  occupy Gaza. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=315.98s)]
*  Can you now admit to the world [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=317.26s)]
*  that you are incorrect? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=318.98s)]
*  No, the situation on the ground [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=322.38s)]
*  changes and beyond that, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=323.86s)]
*  this could have been avoided in [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=325.09999999999997s)]
*  the first place. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=326.53999999999996s)]
*  You're vile, you're vile. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=327.3s)]
*  You're a vile person. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=327.98s)]
*  She's a vile person, straight up. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=329.62s)]
*  The inability, first of all, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=331.9s)]
*  the initial lie, let's just call [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=333.98s)]
*  that for what it was, it was a lie. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=336.38s)]
*  And then the inability to [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=339.65999999999997s)]
*  acknowledge reality. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=341.65999999999997s)]
*  Okay, I knew, everyone who's paying [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=344.98s)]
*  attention knew that Israel intended [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=347.02000000000004s)]
*  to ethnically cleanse Gaza and [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=349.34000000000003s)]
*  occupy the Gaza, I mean, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=351.42s)]
*  just take over the Gaza Strip. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=353.06s)]
*  Everyone knew, everyone who's [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=354.70000000000005s)]
*  paying attention, who's honest [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=356.1s)]
*  about what they're reading, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=357.54s)]
*  what they're seeing, they knew. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=358.74s)]
*  Abby Martin brings it up, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=360.86s)]
*  calls her out on it. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=362.34000000000003s)]
*  And she says, no, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=363.62s)]
*  Israel has no interest in occupying [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=364.94s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=367.58000000000004s)]
*  And then when she gets called out [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=368.94s)]
*  on it, called out on that lie a year [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=370.66s)]
*  later, unable to take [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=372.38s)]
*  responsibility, that's a journalist. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=373.58000000000004s)]
*  That's a journalist. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=375.5s)]
*  It's incredible, total and [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=377.46s)]
*  utter clown. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=380.18s)]
*  So another pro-Israel voice on [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=382.26s)]
*  the panel was Shavos Kestenbaum. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=384.54s)]
*  And look, I disagree with Shavos [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=387.3s)]
*  entirely, he seems less loathsome [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=390.42s)]
*  than Emily Schrader. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=394.22s)]
*  He tried to have a calm [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=397.34s)]
*  conversation. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=398.62s)]
*  I was too heated, and I regret that [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=399.38s)]
*  because I could have had an exchange [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=401.94s)]
*  with him that wasn't as heated as [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=404.38s)]
*  it was. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=406.73999999999995s)]
*  He was trying to lower [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=407.73999999999995s)]
*  the temperature and [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=408.5s)]
*  make the arguments he was making. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=409.26s)]
*  I disagree with his arguments, so [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=410.58s)]
*  I want to just kind of get that out [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=412.21999999999997s)]
*  of the way. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=413.58s)]
*  With that in mind, at one point, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=414.58s)]
*  he stated that everyone who cares [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=416.29999999999995s)]
*  about Palestinians should be [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=418.26s)]

*  IDF soldiers are intentionally [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=426.05999999999995s)]

*  which of course is able to even [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=437.38s)]

*  this is very important. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=527.58s)]
*  You cannot make a succinct argument [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=529.0600000000001s)]

*  you're providing justification for [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=545.94s)]
*  Hamas doing it to Israelis. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=548.3399999999999s)]
*  Because guess what? [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=551.5s)]
*  Humans are humans, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=552.62s)]

*  they must be protected. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=555.14s)]
*  When you come out here and [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=556.9799999999999s)]

*  utter animals that should be [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=563.3s)]

*  Emily Schrader, the lack of [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=575.66s)]

*  I want to thank Pierce Morgan for [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=596.26s)]
*  giving me the last word on the [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=597.66s)]
*  panel and I did switch topics a [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=598.9s)]
*  little bit, it's related. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=600.34s)]
*  But it's a little bit of [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=601.78s)]
*  a different topic, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=603.1s)]
*  important for everyone to know [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=604.1s)]
*  about, let's take a look. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=605.74s)]
*  I just want to mention quickly that [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=607.38s)]
*  Emily is one of these Israelis [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=609.3s)]
*  who's going around doing propaganda [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=610.9s)]
*  tours on manufacturing consent for [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=612.58s)]
*  the United States to go to war with [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=614.26s)]
*  Iran on behalf of Israel. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=616.14s)]
*  We can't make the same mistake that [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=618.7s)]
*  we did in Iraq, we should not go to [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=620.34s)]
*  war in Iran on behalf of Israel. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=622.1s)]
*  If Israel wants to go to war with [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=624.22s)]
*  Iran, they should do it themselves [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=625.42s)]
*  without our military support and [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=627.58s)]
*  that includes taxpayer dollars. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=629.58s)]
*  Go do it on your own, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=631.46s)]
*  go ahead and enlist baby girl, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=632.3s)]
*  go do your thing. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=634.02s)]
*  But leave America out of it, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=635.06s)]
*  our men and women and our armed [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=637.06s)]
*  forces shouldn't die on behalf of [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=638.78s)]
*  your country, period. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=640.74s)]
*  I don't really understand what her [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=642.1s)]
*  argument was there when she's like [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=643.78s)]
*  Iran isn't an Arab country. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=645.54s)]
*  I didn't say it was an Arab country [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=647.98s)]
*  and what is that argument? [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=649.9399999999999s)]
*  The US should not go to war with [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=653.06s)]
*  Iran on behalf of Israel. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=654.5799999999999s)]
*  Now, Israel has bought our [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=656.14s)]
*  politician so who knows what the [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=658.1s)]
*  Trump administration is going to [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=660.42s)]
*  decide to do, it will be [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=662.5799999999999s)]
*  a disastrous war. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=664.02s)]
*  It will be a deeply, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=665.18s)]
*  deeply unpopular war that will [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=666.8599999999999s)]
*  define Donald Trump's legacy. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=669.2199999999999s)]
*  I mean, the one thing he cares [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=672.7399999999999s)]
*  about the most is himself. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=674.14s)]
*  So hopefully he's smart enough to [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=675.18s)]
*  understand what an error that [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=677.26s)]
*  would be for his legacy. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=679.18s)]
*  But I don't really have much hope [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=681.4599999999999s)]
*  with any politician much less [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=683.8599999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump at this point. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=686.02s)]
*  So we'll see what happens. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=688.06s)]
*  But I want to be clear for anyone [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=689.9399999999999s)]
*  who thinks my behavior and [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=692.78s)]
*  my conduct on Piers Morgan's show [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=695.22s)]
*  today was unprofessional and [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=698.42s)]
*  unbecoming, you are correct and [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=701.26s)]
*  I am not sorry. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=704.3s)]
*  I would do it again. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=705.9399999999999s)]
*  IDF soldiers are intentionally [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=707.02s)]
*  shooting at and killing desperate [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=709.3s)]
*  Palestinians as they're trying to [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=711.86s)]
*  get humanitarian aid from this [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=714.5s)]
*  Israeli backed organization, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=716.74s)]
*  which of course is able to even [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=719.1s)]
*  exist because they defamed UNRWA. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=721.14s)]
*  They starved Palestinians for [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=723.58s)]
*  months, shut up. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=725.4200000000001s)]
*  They starved Palestinians for [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=726.46s)]
*  months and then as the Palestinians [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=728.22s)]
*  are desperate for food, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=730.38s)]
*  they lure them in with this Gaza [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=731.94s)]
*  humanitarian foundation and [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=733.9s)]
*  shoot at them. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=735.86s)]
*  Upward of 200 people since late May [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=736.78s)]
*  have been shot at and [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=739.46s)]
*  killed by Israeli soldiers. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=741.02s)]
*  I was right and unfortunately this [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=745.6600000000001s)]
*  is because another 36 people have [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=748.4599999999999s)]
*  been shot at and killed by the [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=750.8199999999999s)]
*  Israeli Defense Forces as they were [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=752.78s)]
*  desperately seeking humanitarian [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=755.26s)]
*  aid from a US and Israel backed [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=757.74s)]
*  Gaza humanitarian foundation hub. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=759.9399999999999s)]
*  So 207 more people by the way were [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=763.3399999999999s)]
*  injured as a result of these [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=765.9799999999999s)]
*  shootings and that's according to [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=768.3s)]
*  the Associated Press. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=771.26s)]
*  So just yesterday, there were [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=772.9799999999999s)]
*  upward of 200 Palestinians who had [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=774.9799999999999s)]
*  been killed in similar circumstances. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=777.26s)]
*  Obviously that death toll is now [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=779.5s)]
*  growing and it's unlikely to stop [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=781.94s)]
*  because Palestinians are in one of [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=784.34s)]
*  the worst situations imaginable in [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=786.82s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=789.38s)]
*  They've been starved for months. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=790.4200000000001s)]
*  They're desperate to feed their [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=792.62s)]
*  families, they're desperate to feed [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=794.14s)]
*  themselves. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=796.02s)]
*  And so they will risk their lives [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=796.6600000000001s)]
*  knowing there's a huge possibility [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=798.5400000000001s)]
*  that IDF soldiers are going to [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=800.62s)]
*  shoot at them as they're trying to [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=802.34s)]
*  get humanitarian aid from one of [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=804.34s)]
*  the Israeli military. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=806.78s)]
*  So when I call someone like [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=807.9399999999999s)]
*  Emily Schrader disgusting repeatedly [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=809.66s)]
*  for denying this reality, I do so [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=812.3399999999999s)]
*  because I feel it's righteous to do [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=814.8199999999999s)]
*  so. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=817.3399999999999s)]
*  Lying to us about what's really [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=817.8599999999999s)]
*  going on isn't okay, but [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=820.54s)]
*  what's obviously even worse is the [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=822.5799999999999s)]

*  acknowledging that there's [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=862.6999999999999s)]
*  actually firing the shots is huge [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=865.42s)]
*  because previously they were [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=867.58s)]
*  denying it. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=869.58s)]
*  But there was a CNN investigation [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=870.1800000000001s)]
*  where they analyzed the shots [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=872.42s)]

*  we were just shooting warning [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=883.42s)]
*  shots, the kind of warning shots [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=885.38s)]

*  if there's no violence being [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=905.58s)]

*  Can someone explain that to me? [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=913.02s)]
*  I mean, I think the explanation is [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=915.02s)]
*  actually pretty obvious, which is [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=917.1s)]
*  they just want to kill these people. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=919.34s)]
*  And they've been carrying out acts [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=921.78s)]

*  these people. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=927.18s)]
*  And whoever remains, [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=927.9399999999999s)]
*  they're going to try to get out of [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=929.5s)]
*  the Gaza Strip or constrained to or [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=931.9s)]

*  miserable that they'll want to [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=939.14s)]
*  leave the Gaza Strip. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=941.42s)]
*  But was, I mean, [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=943.26s)]
*  this has been going on. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=944.2199999999999s)]
*  I feel like there's no interest in [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=945.9s)]
*  any justice for the Palestinians [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=947.98s)]

*  the Israeli government and the IDF. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=951.9s)]
*  And it's just disgusting and [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=953.74s)]
*  hopeless, it feels super hopeless. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=955.0600000000001s)]
*  In northern Gaza, two men and [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=956.74s)]

*  that's according to Nader Gargun. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=964.3000000000001s)]
*  He's a spokesperson for [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=967.1800000000001s)]
*  the Al-Aouda Hospital, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=968.78s)]

*  gunshot wounds. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=973.98s)]

*  Man, I remember when they used to [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=977.74s)]
*  trot that one out. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=980.14s)]
*  No military has ever taken more [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=981.78s)]
*  pains to not kill civilians than [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=984.1s)]

*  Israel, of course, and nobody else. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=989.14s)]

*  people to know that there is no [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=994.0600000000001s)]

*  Israel's border. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1001.98s)]

*  They're just doing this to do it. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1020.54s)]

*  This is terrorist logic. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1049.22s)]
*  The idea that there's this thing [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1051.1799999999998s)]
*  that happened that was, yeah, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1053.22s)]
*  obviously horrible. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1055.26s)]
*  Obviously atrocities were [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1057.3799999999999s)]
*  committed. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1058.78s)]
*  So now I'm going to do something [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1059.3s)]
*  that is completely holy, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1061.34s)]
*  not even in the same proportion. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1062.98s)]
*  Again, and I bring this up again, [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1065.06s)]

*  nobody. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1080.9s)]

*  October 7th. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1090.8200000000002s)]

*  atrocities and draw attention to [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1093.78s)]
*  them when they want to justify [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1095.74s)]
*  going after Hamas. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1097.62s)]
*  But there is every indication that [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1098.94s)]
*  this isn't about going after Hamas. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1101.26s)]
*  Okay, this is about- [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1104.1s)]
*  They failed, Ana. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1104.94s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1106.06s)]
*  Hamas is probably on more members [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1106.66s)]
*  now than they did on October 7th. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1108.62s)]

*  a conversation about atrocities [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1112.26s)]

*  all foreign press and [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1433.82s)]

*  And then the second part is [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1448.58s)]
*  the humiliation. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1449.9399999999998s)]
*  They love to do this, and [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1450.86s)]
*  it's a lot of what tormentors do. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1452.34s)]

*  they've taken on that role. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1461.54s)]
*  And so they've become gratuitously [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1464.06s)]
*  disgustingly torturous. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1466.78s)]

*  this is what you wanted Israel to [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1490.22s)]

*  territories. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1513.06s)]

*  Syria? [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1517.5s)]
*  Well, they're doing greater Israel. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1518.54s)]
*  Because, I mean, look, [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1520.58s)]
*  I don't know, if you're an Israeli [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1521.82s)]
*  or not, did you know the plan was [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1523.58s)]
*  always greater Israel? [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1525.98s)]
*  Do you love that it's greater [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1528.02s)]
*  Israel and then you keep going into [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1529.82s)]
*  Arab land and taking it and [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1531.9399999999998s)]
*  pretending it's for self-defense [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1533.58s)]
*  and then slaughtering the people [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1535.62s)]
*  inside and treating them as [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1537.4199999999998s)]
*  hostages and prisoners for 58 years? [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1538.9399999999998s)]
*  Was that the goal? [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1541.22s)]
*  Was that what you dreamt about with [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1542.1399999999999s)]
*  Israel, that you always wanted to [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1544.1799999999998s)]
*  take more and more Arab land while [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1546.3s)]
*  pretending to do self-defense? [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1548.3799999999999s)]
*  Or did you really actually want [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1550.58s)]
*  a peaceful Israel? [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1552.1s)]
*  because if you wanted Israel that [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1553.62s)]
*  was lived in peace with its [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1555.54s)]
*  neighbors, you're going in [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1557.1399999999999s)]
*  the exact wrong direction. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1559.06s)]
*  And if you wanted it to be a safe [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1561.22s)]
*  haven for Jews, how does it help to [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1563.06s)]
*  get the entire world to despise [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1565.26s)]
*  Israel by doing things like this? [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1567.3s)]
*  How does that help? [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1569.5s)]
*  So I don't know, [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1571.54s)]
*  if you love Israel, you should be [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1572.5s)]
*  10,000 times more disgusted by this [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1574.6999999999998s)]
*  story than we are, and [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1577.22s)]
*  you should take action to get [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1578.78s)]
*  Israel to turn around. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1580.98s)]
*  But if this is what you like, [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1583.18s)]
*  then you become a monster too. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1584.94s)]
*  All right, we're going to give you [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1587.22s)]
*  more evidence in a sec. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1589.46s)]
*  But yeah, I think that regardless [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1592.5800000000002s)]
*  of what Israel or anybody who [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1594.46s)]
*  supports Israel's government's [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1596.02s)]
*  goal was, what we're looking at is [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1597.8200000000002s)]
*  just a complete lack of boundaries [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1599.5800000000002s)]
*  and a lack of consequences for [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1601.3s)]
*  anything that they've ever done. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1602.8600000000001s)]
*  because the first issue was Israel [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1604.5s)]
*  being founded in land that was [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1606.26s)]
*  already occupied. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1607.8200000000002s)]
*  So that in and of itself created [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1608.9s)]
*  the issue that's still been going [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1610.46s)]
*  on, but I mean, [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1612.18s)]
*  ever since Israel's founding, [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1613.0600000000002s)]
*  America has been firmly behind [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1614.6200000000001s)]
*  their government. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1616.3s)]
*  So, I mean, this is one of the [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1617.22s)]
*  issues that Democrats or [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1618.78s)]
*  Republicans are practically [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1619.98s)]
*  identical on in terms of the [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1621.46s)]
*  handling of the Israeli state. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1622.8600000000001s)]
*  Doesn't matter what they do, [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1624.5800000000002s)]
*  they get the weapons that they [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1626.02s)]
*  request when they request them. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1627.54s)]
*  They get upgrades when they [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1629.18s)]
*  request them. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1630.5800000000002s)]
*  And despite the world's lack of [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1631.42s)]
*  enthusiasm for what's happening to [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1633.54s)]
*  the Palestinian people, [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1636.02s)]
*  what difference does it make if [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1637.74s)]
*  the powers that be don't do [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1639.8600000000001s)]
*  anything about it? [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1641.66s)]
*  So even if we get a real progressive [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1642.5s)]
*  to be president, which that's [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1644.5400000000002s)]
*  a huge uphill battle, [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1646.5s)]
*  it's easier to get progressives in [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1647.8200000000002s)]
*  like house seats and stuff like [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1649.9s)]
*  that, nothing's impossible. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1651.66s)]
*  But even if we did do that, [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1653.22s)]
*  I mean, sure, maybe we could get [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1654.7s)]
*  a little bit of leeway, but [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1656.5s)]
*  what would really change because [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1658.02s)]
*  that AIPAC money and [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1659.98s)]
*  just Israeli influence over them [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1661.18s)]
*  being one of our top allies, [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1663.38s)]
*  is one person really going to be [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1665.14s)]
*  able to change that? [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1667.22s)]
*  So unfortunately, I think that's [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1668.5400000000002s)]
*  an issue that may never change that [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1670.86s)]
*  much unless everybody, not just [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1673.22s)]
*  Americans, but the whole world [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1675.5s)]
*  stands up to the leaders and [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1677.62s)]
*  their government and demand change. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1679.34s)]
*  Otherwise, it's just too ingrained [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1681.82s)]
*  in the system. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1683.86s)]
*  We've got some of the stats that [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1684.66s)]

*  reporters. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1788.54s)]
*  So, and that leads me to another [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1789.38s)]
*  point, which is that our media, [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1791.22s)]
*  our so-called reporters, [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1793.18s)]

*  I mean, my God, [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1818.38s)]
*  when there's journalists killed in [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1819.06s)]
*  other conflicts, rightfully so, [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1820.5s)]

*  so we had to kill them all, [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1961.14s)]
*  you see it. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1962.34s)]
*  And you know why we did it? [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1963.14s)]
*  Self-defense, self-defense. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1964.26s)]
*  But our reporters in America [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1966.34s)]
*  haven't figured it out. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1967.82s)]
*  Reporters all across the world, [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1969.74s)]
*  governments across the world, [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1971.3s)]
*  start rebelling against Israel. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1972.86s)]
*  Why do you work for them? [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1975.54s)]
*  Tell me, I get why our scumbag [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1977.42s)]
*  politicians work for them. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1978.94s)]
*  They literally get bribed. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1980.5s)]
*  I know it's legal bribes, but [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1981.66s)]
*  it's obviously bribes. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1983.3799999999999s)]
*  But reporters, [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1985.06s)]
*  why do you work for them? [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1985.98s)]
*  And aren't you just embarrassed? [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1987.9s)]
*  So they humiliate these poor BBC [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1989.9s)]
*  reporters, strip them down their [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1991.6200000000001s)]
*  underwear, do all this stuff, [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1993.3400000000001s)]
*  right? [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1994.94s)]
*  But in a sense, aren't they doing [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1995.5s)]
*  that to everyone on cable news in [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1997.02s)]
*  America? [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1998.46s)]
*  I mean, they have to go out there [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=1999.8200000000002s)]
*  and do this humiliating reports [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2001.42s)]
*  like Israel is the most moral army. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2003.02s)]
*  The Palestinians had it coming. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2005.5800000000002s)]
*  They deserve it. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2007.5800000000002s)]
*  They're the terrorists. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2008.38s)]
*  Not Israel, not Israel. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2009.66s)]
*  Israel has killed over 500 times [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2011.5s)]
*  the number of children that Hamas [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2013.9s)]
*  killed and are dumb ass humiliating [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2016.38s)]
*  reporters. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2019.42s)]
*  Go out there and go, no, Hamas and [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2021.5s)]
*  Palestinians are the savage [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2023.9s)]
*  terrorists. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2025.94s)]
*  Israel, no way. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2026.8600000000001s)]
*  Accidentally, they accidentally [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2028.5s)]
*  murdered 16,000 kids. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2030.1000000000001s)]
*  They accidentally murdered 30,000 [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2031.6200000000001s)]
*  women and children. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2033.54s)]
*  It was all an accident. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2034.9s)]
*  They didn't mean it. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2035.98s)]
*  They're the best. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2036.94s)]
*  Humiliating. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2038.38s)]
*  Well, I think also not just the [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2040.5s)]
*  biggest issue obviously is the money [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2041.98s)]
*  and how long it's been involved. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2043.8600000000001s)]
*  But also, this kind of reminds me [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2046.54s)]
*  of how the public and reporters and [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2048.78s)]
*  things like that have become very [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2051.38s)]
*  desensitized to issues like gun [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2053.7400000000002s)]
*  violence in America. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2055.98s)]
*  It's so permeated in our daily news [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2057.6600000000003s)]
*  cycle. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2060.26s)]
*  It's so much a part of what we [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2060.94s)]
*  expect that you just kind of look [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2062.94s)]
*  the other way. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2065.1800000000003s)]
*  And unfortunately, I think that [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2066.78s)]
*  that's what a lot of the public [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2069.26s)]
*  feels for people who aren't like [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2071.34s)]
*  very strong supporters of [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2073.5400000000004s)]
*  Palestinian rights. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2075.42s)]
*  So, there's another day, [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2077.14s)]
*  another thing that Israel's doing. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2078.7s)]
*  So, it's just ingrained in how we [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2081.2599999999998s)]
*  do what we do. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2083.2999999999997s)]
*  It's heartbreaking. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2084.94s)]
*  It's absolutely heartbreaking. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2085.9s)]
*  This is totally preventable. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2087.06s)]
*  There's no need for it. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2088.46s)]
*  And I think there's a lot of blood [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2089.3399999999997s)]
*  on the hands of international [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2090.94s)]
*  agencies and especially US [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2092.58s)]
*  politicians who enable it and [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2093.98s)]
*  block any attempt to hold this [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2095.62s)]
*  government and their military [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2097.2999999999997s)]
*  accountable because that's why [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2099.1s)]
*  this continues. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2100.9s)]
*  If there were any repercussions for [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2102.9s)]
*  this at one death, at two deaths, [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2104.94s)]
*  it wouldn't happen and [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2107.5s)]
*  it wouldn't be the numbers that [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2108.56s)]
*  we're seeing more than all of [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2109.98s)]
*  these wars combined. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2111.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, our governments are all [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2113.58s)]
*  giant sellouts. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2115.1s)]

*  Do you think the British government [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2117.94s)]
*  represents the British people? [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2119.1s)]
*  You think they're enraged by what [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2120.78s)]
*  happened to BBC? [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2122.2200000000003s)]
*  No, they're going to lie down and [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2123.1800000000003s)]
*  take it again. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2124.46s)]

*  Israel. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2126.54s)]
*  They're going to send them more [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2127.2200000000003s)]
*  money, more weapons, [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cGHKu9HWKE&t=2128.38s)]
