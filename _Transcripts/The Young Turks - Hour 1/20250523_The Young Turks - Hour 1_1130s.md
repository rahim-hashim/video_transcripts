"A federal judge has temporarily halted the Trump administration‚Äôs ban on Harvard University‚Äôs ability to enroll international students.

US District Court Judge Allison Burroughs ruled hours after the nation‚Äôs oldest and wealthiest college filed suit Friday. Harvard argued revocation of its certification in the Student and Exchange Visitor Program was ‚Äúclear retaliation‚Äù for its refusal of the government‚Äôs ideologically rooted policy demands."

TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

# Judge Blocks Trump's WILD Attack On Foreign Harvard Students
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [May 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI)
*  A judge has blocked the Trump [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=0.0s)]
*  administration's recent move to [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=1.58s)]
*  halt Harvard University from [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=3.38s)]
*  enrolling any international [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=5.0s)]
*  students. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  This is Judge Alison Burroughs, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=7.0600000000000005s)]
*  who issued a temporary restraining [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=8.6s)]
*  order against the federal edict, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=10.28s)]
*  agreeing with Harvard that they'd [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=11.88s)]
*  shown that its implementation would [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=13.52s)]
*  cause, quote, immediate and [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=15.36s)]
*  irreparable injury to the university. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=16.84s)]
*  Because it would stop them not only [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=18.94s)]
*  in the future from enrolling them, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=20.26s)]
*  but the current students as well, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=21.7s)]
*  which is chaotic. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=23.06s)]
*  And we're going to give you all [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=23.96s)]
*  the numbers about how crazy that [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=25.1s)]
*  would be. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=26.32s)]
*  But to rewind just a little bit, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=26.82s)]
*  this move comes after the head of [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=28.52s)]
*  the Department of Homeland Security [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=30.16s)]
*  and enthusiastic dog murderer, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=32.08s)]
*  Kristi Noem, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=33.82s)]
*  ordered the university to hand over [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  all records of international [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=36.28s)]
*  students' illegal and violent [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=37.8s)]
*  activities. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=39.54s)]
*  Which is code words for [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=40.86s)]
*  advocating for a ceasefire, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=41.96s)]
*  an end to genocide, whatever. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=43.78s)]
*  And so if this had been allowed to [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=46.019999999999996s)]
*  stand, or if it in the end goes [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=47.980000000000004s)]
*  through, maybe the Supreme Court [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=49.86s)]
*  will allow it, that would affect [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=51.82s)]
*  fully a quarter of Harvard's [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=53.7s)]
*  student body. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=55.46s)]
*  About 6,800 international students [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=56.379999999999995s)]
*  were killed by Harvard in the last [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=58.42s)]
*  year, and so that's a significant [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=60.34s)]
*  percentage of their student body, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=62.260000000000005s)]
*  of the money that Harvard brings in. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=64.26s)]
*  It's part of why Harvard is not [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=66.38s)]
*  only known as this famous and [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=68.58s)]
*  respected American university, but [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=70.72s)]
*  is known worldwide, partly because [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=73.42s)]
*  people all over the world [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=75.8s)]
*  wants to come here. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=77.34s)]
*  Well, if it's up to Trump, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=78.78s)]
*  then that may end. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=80.24000000000001s)]
*  And Kristi Noem wants to make clear [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=81.58s)]
*  that this isn't just about Harvard, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=83.62s)]
*  that's just the beginning of much [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=85.84s)]
*  more, take a look. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=87.76s)]
*  This should be a warning to every [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=88.52000000000001s)]
*  other university to get your act [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=90.0s)]
*  together, get your act together. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=91.52000000000001s)]
*  Because we are coming to make sure [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=92.92s)]
*  that these programs that you are [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=94.72000000000001s)]
*  facilitating an environment where [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=96.46000000000001s)]
*  students can learn, where they're [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=98.36000000000001s)]
*  safe and that they're not [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=100.36000000000001s)]
*  discriminated against based on [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=101.82000000000001s)]
*  their race or their religion. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=103.68s)]
*  Antisemitism will not be stood for [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=105.32000000000001s)]
*  and any participation with a [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=107.24000000000001s)]
*  country or an entity or [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=108.96000000000001s)]
*  a terrorist group that hates America [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=110.4s)]
*  and perpetuates this kind of [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=112.52000000000001s)]
*  violence, we will stop it. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=114.2s)]
*  Okay, so again, a lot of that is [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=116.1s)]
*  just code words. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=117.67999999999999s)]
*  I mean, there's great reporting [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=118.67999999999999s)]
*  earlier this week on the close ties [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=120.17999999999999s)]
*  multiple members of the Trump [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=121.8s)]
*  administration have to antisemitic [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=123.1s)]
*  organizations and figures. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=124.75999999999999s)]
*  They don't care about that, they're [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=126.32s)]
*  not doing anything about that [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=127.67999999999999s)]
*  because this isn't actually about [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=128.8s)]
*  antisemitism, it's about cracking [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=130.12s)]
*  down on pro-Palestinian speech, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=131.72s)]
*  op-eds, signs, whatever. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=133.48s)]
*  And so, Cenk, she says there, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=135.0s)]
*  she just wants people to be free, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=136.92s)]
*  not to be discriminated against, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=138.88s)]
*  while trying to stop anyone born [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=140.88s)]
*  outside of the United States from [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=142.6s)]
*  coming here. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=144.4s)]
*  That seems a little bit [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=145.28s)]
*  inconsistent. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=146.12s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot of different [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=147.36s)]
*  things here that we gotta go over. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=148.84s)]
*  So first of all, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=150.28s)]
*  Randy Fine, a Republican [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=151.3s)]
*  congressman said yesterday that we [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=152.9s)]
*  should nuke Gaza and it's because [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=155.32s)]
*  Muslims know nothing but violence. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=157.48s)]
*  And today, he said that he would be [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=159.92000000000002s)]
*  concerned about going next to [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=162.32s)]
*  a Muslim like Ilhan Omar. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=164.48s)]
*  So I'm sure that they're taking [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=166.52s)]
*  away all of his funding and [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=168.4s)]
*  there's congressional hearings. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=169.92000000000002s)]
*  No, we're not concerned about [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=173.24s)]
*  Islamophobia or any other problem, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=174.84s)]
*  only antisemitism. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=177.56s)]
*  Now, even if that were true, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=180.20000000000002s)]
*  which it isn't, if only if that [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=181.44s)]
*  were true, that's already [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=183.08s)]
*  disastrous and makes no sense. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=184.52s)]
*  And by the way, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=187.16s)]
*  would lead to more antisemitism. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=187.76s)]
*  Because you're saying we will only [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=189.68s)]
*  protect Jewish Americans. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=191.24s)]
*  We will not protect anyone else. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=193.24s)]
*  You can say anything you want about [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=194.48000000000002s)]
*  Muslims, Christians, Americans, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=195.88s)]
*  Buddhists, who cares? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=197.4s)]
*  Level them, say anything you like, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=198.36s)]
*  okay? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=200.32s)]
*  You say something against [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=200.88s)]
*  a Jewish American, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=202.04s)]
*  we're going to kick you out of [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=203.16s)]

*  two, which is that Chuck Schumer and [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=209.64000000000001s)]
*  I believe seven other Jewish [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=211.56s)]

*  called antisemitism task force. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=224.36s)]
*  So what we have here is not just [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=226.28s)]
*  a battle between Trump and Harvard. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=227.84s)]

*  This is asked for by ludicrous. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=255.32s)]
*  Like in calling them right wing [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=259.0s)]
*  doesn't even do it justice. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=260.48s)]
*  Absolute radical pro-Israel, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=261.68s)]

*  Adelson, okay? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=266.6s)]
*  So now that leads to point number [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=268.20000000000005s)]
*  three and the most important point. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=269.6s)]
*  Mainstream media is so [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=271.0s)]
*  frustrating. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=273.56s)]
*  None of them even point out, hey, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=275.76s)]
*  this is to make sure that you shut [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=278.16s)]
*  down any critic of Israel. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=280.36s)]
*  And by the way, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=282.64000000000004s)]
*  Kristi Noem says, yes, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=283.44s)]
*  we will not allow anti-Israel bias. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=285.0s)]
*  Not just antisemitism, but [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=288.20000000000005s)]
*  anti-Israel bias. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=289.76000000000005s)]
*  But to be fair, they also said you [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=290.8s)]
*  can't discriminate against Norway [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=292.24s)]
*  or Peru or Botswana or Cambodia. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=293.84000000000003s)]
*  No, right, they didn't say that [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=296.36s)]
*  about any other country. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=297.6s)]
*  They just said you're not allowed [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=299.0s)]
*  to do free speech in this country [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=300.68s)]
*  if it's against Israel. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=302.36s)]
*  It can't be any more blatant than [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=304.16s)]
*  that and mainstream media is like, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=305.64000000000004s)]
*  I don't see it. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=307.04s)]
*  It looks like they have a legitimate [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=307.96000000000004s)]
*  effort to combat antisemitism, but [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=309.44000000000005s)]
*  perhaps they've gone a little too [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=311.04s)]
*  far and then on the side they say, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=312.52000000000004s)]
*  Harvard says they might not comply. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=314.24s)]
*  But do they ever say this is not [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=316.20000000000005s)]
*  a legitimate fight against [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=318.0s)]
*  antisemitism? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=319.56s)]
*  Almost all the Democratic, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=320.64s)]
*  not even Democratic, but [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=322.12s)]
*  Jewish senators overall in Congress [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=323.56s)]
*  are against this. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=325.64s)]
*  So how could it be battling [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=326.88s)]
*  antisemitism, etc.? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=328.68s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=331.12s)]
*  God forbid anybody on cable news [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=332.71999999999997s)]
*  should accurately point out that [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=334.52s)]
*  some donors that favor Israel [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=336.56s)]
*  obviously control our politicians. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=338.35999999999996s)]
*  And this is in the context of [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=341.52s)]
*  Donald Trump, they've called every [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=343.24s)]

*  the world, right? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=349.36s)]
*  So it's not like cable news is shy [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=352.04s)]
*  about criticizing Donald Trump. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=354.04s)]
*  But when it comes to his actions [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=356.36s)]

*  antisemitism, let's pretend this is [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=364.24s)]
*  about fighting hatred overall. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=366.48s)]

*  Jesus is going to come back and [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=472.12s)]
*  kill all these Jewish people. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=474.18s)]
*  It's so strange, the bedfellows [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=476.48s)]
*  that end up lining up on [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=478.92s)]
*  the pro-Israel camp. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=480.59999999999997s)]
*  But I think the reason why they're [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=482.48s)]
*  taking such an aggressive posture [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=484.56s)]
*  is because they are just losing [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=486.68s)]
*  the propaganda war. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=488.52s)]
*  They just, nobody is behind this. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=489.91999999999996s)]
*  Absolutely nobody supports it. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=492.72s)]
*  The entire Democratic Party base [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=494.8s)]
*  has completely turned against [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=496.88000000000005s)]
*  Israel and this war. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=498.68s)]
*  Even Republicans are not, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=499.88000000000005s)]
*  most Republicans, except for [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=501.84000000000003s)]
*  a faction of older Republicans, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=503.88000000000005s)]
*  don't support this war. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=506.08000000000004s)]
*  And that's why they have to be so [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=507.72s)]
*  aggressive in tamping down speech. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=509.16s)]
*  Yeah, in terms of tamping down [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=510.88000000000005s)]
*  speech, I've only been doing this [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=512.76s)]
*  for 13 years or whatever, but [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=514.84s)]
*  I've been following politics since [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=516.6800000000001s)]
*  roughly around 2001. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=518.8000000000001s)]
*  And not everything is worse than it [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=520.8s)]
*  was back when George W was [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=522.68s)]
*  president, there were plenty of [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=524.0s)]
*  terrible things happening back then. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=525.68s)]
*  But I was thinking about these two [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=527.8s)]
*  times when they've tried to really [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=529.9599999999999s)]
*  clamp down on free speech, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=532.04s)]
*  they've really gone in hard against [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=533.8s)]
*  Muslims in America. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=536.0799999999999s)]
*  And when they did it in the wake of [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=538.36s)]
*  9-11, they took a terror attack [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=540.48s)]
*  that some Muslims had committed. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=542.56s)]
*  And then that was it basically for [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=545.36s)]
*  your civil liberties and [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=546.88s)]
*  civil rights if you're [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=547.92s)]
*  Muslim in America. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=548.92s)]
*  There were infiltrating groups and [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=550.2s)]
*  everything, they were passed [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=551.5600000000001s)]
*  the Patriot Act. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=552.5600000000001s)]
*  So some Muslims committed a terror [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=553.52s)]
*  attack, and then that was it for [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=555.0400000000001s)]
*  the rights. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=556.4000000000001s)]
*  In this case, it's crimes being [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=556.88s)]
*  committed against Muslims, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=558.96s)]
*  like war crimes, genocide against [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=560.88s)]
*  Muslims, and we're also still going [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=562.88s)]
*  to take your rights away. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=564.76s)]
*  You're not even the ones who [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=565.84s)]
*  are doing it. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=566.9200000000001s)]
*  It's you who are facing the [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=567.9200000000001s)]
*  genocide, it's your land that [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=569.2s)]
*  we're talking about stealing. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=570.8000000000001s)]
*  And don't you dare talk about [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=572.72s)]
*  the fact that you're the target of [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=574.1600000000001s)]
*  the most heinous war crimes we've [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=575.6800000000001s)]
*  seen in living memory. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=577.2800000000001s)]
*  That's, again, not everything's [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=578.92s)]
*  worse than it was 20 years ago, but [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=580.52s)]
*  I feel like this is pretty [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=582.0s)]
*  significantly worse. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=583.12s)]
*  And also on the actions against [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=584.52s)]
*  Harvard, it has been moving so [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=586.4399999999999s)]
*  quickly. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=588.4399999999999s)]
*  They came up with this thing where [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=589.52s)]
*  you can't have international [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=591.12s)]
*  students, again, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=592.4799999999999s)]
*  not everyone can, it's very [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=593.5999999999999s)]
*  targeted. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=595.0s)]
*  That's how the Trump [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=595.88s)]
*  administration works right now. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=596.64s)]
*  Everything is individualistic, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=597.64s)]
*  personal against organizations, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=599.76s)]
*  corporations, law offices, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=601.76s)]
*  and individual. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=603.4399999999999s)]
*  They're doing this to Harvard, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=604.92s)]
*  they froze $3 billion in contracts [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=606.64s)]
*  they want to tax just their [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=608.56s)]
*  endowment. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=610.3599999999999s)]
*  It is so specific and biased, and [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=611.1999999999999s)]
*  that's the way they're operating. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=613.5999999999999s)]
*  They talked about the Biden [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=616.4799999999999s)]
*  administration, his DOJ doing this [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=617.9599999999999s)]
*  weaponizing, going after individuals. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=619.76s)]
*  But Tom Homan is demonizing AOC, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=621.9599999999999s)]
*  talking about locking her up on [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=624.0s)]
*  a daily basis. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=625.7199999999999s)]
*  They're doing charges against [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=626.52s)]
*  politicians, they're strong arming [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=628.28s)]
*  law offices into providing this pro [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=630.3599999999999s)]
*  bono services. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=632.1999999999999s)]
*  They've taken their individual [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=633.04s)]
*  donors and they shut down all the [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=634.64s)]
*  investigations, all the frauds, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=636.1999999999999s)]
*  and all that on their corporations. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=637.8399999999999s)]
*  It's not just that we're seeing [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=639.88s)]
*  more of this type of stuff, biased, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=641.5999999999999s)]
*  weaponized government. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=643.52s)]
*  I feel like we're seeing more of it [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=644.8s)]
*  than there has been in the rest of [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=646.56s)]
*  our lives, all in the period of [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=648.3199999999999s)]
*  about three months. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=650.04s)]
*  And I just wonder how much worse it [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=651.1999999999999s)]
*  can get over the course of a full [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=652.88s)]
*  four year term. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=654.4799999999999s)]
*  Well, there's no question, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=655.12s)]
*  this is as bad as I've ever seen it. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=656.8399999999999s)]
*  So Trump, I'm sorry, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=658.8399999999999s)]
*  Bush was worse in other ways. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=660.3199999999999s)]
*  He invaded Iraq, hundreds of [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=662.4s)]
*  thousands of people died, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=664.4s)]
*  it's hard to get worse than that. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=666.3199999999999s)]
*  And he restarted torture and [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=669.8s)]
*  warrantless wiretapping and [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=671.8399999999999s)]
*  crashed the economy and [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=674.06s)]
*  sunk New Orleans. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=675.88s)]
*  So he did a lot of terrible things [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=677.88s)]
*  and by the way, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=679.72s)]
*  destroyed the budget and [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=680.68s)]
*  passed tax cuts even bigger than [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=682.14s)]
*  Trump's. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=683.88s)]
*  So I get all that, right? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=684.56s)]
*  But in terms of constitutional [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=687.0s)]
*  violations and constantly over [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=689.1999999999999s)]
*  reaching and cracking down, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=691.5799999999999s)]
*  ironically, on freedom of speech and [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=693.56s)]
*  freedom overall, this is easily [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=696.16s)]
*  the worst administration. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=698.3199999999999s)]
*  I mean, I get asked every single [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=700.36s)]
*  day online, well, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=702.28s)]
*  if you're so anti established, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=703.4799999999999s)]
*  why'd you vote for Kamala Harris? [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=705.4399999999999s)]
*  This is why I voted for [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=707.7199999999999s)]
*  Kamala Harris, because Trump said [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=708.64s)]
*  before when he lost the 2020 [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=710.4399999999999s)]
*  election, that we should terminate [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=712.04s)]
*  the Constitution. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=714.04s)]
*  He has no respect for [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=715.8s)]
*  the Constitution at all. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=716.8399999999999s)]
*  Then immediately gets in, starts [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=718.1999999999999s)]
*  talking about how he's going to run [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=719.56s)]
*  again when he obviously, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=721.0s)]

*  them. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=738.32s)]
*  And we did it anyway, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=739.2s)]
*  because who cares about court [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=740.14s)]
*  orders? [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=741.28s)]

*  Muslims, we were all told to hate [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=814.9599999999999s)]
*  Muslims, so that we would fight [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=816.64s)]
*  Israel's wars in the Middle East. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=818.4399999999999s)]
*  And you're telling me that there's [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=821.4399999999999s)]
*  no dissension on the right? [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=823.12s)]

*  it's about to boil over. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=826.36s)]
*  And when that happens, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=828.4s)]
*  I don't know what Trump's going to [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=829.3199999999999s)]
*  do. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=830.52s)]

*  Israel. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=841.9599999999999s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=843.7199999999999s)]
*  I'm saying it now, I said it by [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=845.36s)]
*  the way at the beginning of [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=846.56s)]
*  the Trump administration when [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=847.52s)]
*  absolutely no one believed me, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=848.8399999999999s)]
*  okay? [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=850.4399999999999s)]
*  So I'm telling you right now, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=851.12s)]
*  there's no way that all of those [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=853.36s)]
*  shows that have already come out [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=855.68s)]
*  and said, why are we still [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=857.92s)]
*  funding Israel? [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=859.56s)]
*  Why are we talking about attacking [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=860.64s)]
*  Iran on behalf of Israel? [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=862.76s)]
*  Why did we not get the Epstein [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=864.76s)]
*  files that all going to turn around [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=866.24s)]
*  and go, yes, sir, of course, sir, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=868.0799999999999s)]
*  we should all serve Netanyahu [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=870.24s)]
*  loyally and Israel should be first. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=872.08s)]
*  It's not going to happen. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=874.48s)]
*  And so here, here's another case [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=875.84s)]
*  for you guys, I say things ahead [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=877.92s)]
*  of time. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=879.96s)]
*  Everybody else does Monday morning [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=880.92s)]
*  quarterback, okay? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=882.72s)]
*  So if it turns out, no, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=884.04s)]
*  I was wrong, none of the right wing [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=885.4s)]
*  shows flipped on him. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=887.2s)]
*  And if he attacks Iran or [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=888.4s)]
*  does all these things, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=889.96s)]
*  they will all say, of course, sir, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=891.4s)]
*  we love war, sir, we love Israel, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=893.4s)]
*  sir, then I was wrong. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=895.2s)]
*  And then you say, okay, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=896.48s)]
*  I'm not going to watch Young [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=897.4s)]

*  that guy doesn't know anything. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=898.84s)]
*  But if it turns out that the right [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=899.84s)]
*  wing is an open revolt, and [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=901.5600000000001s)]
*  we were right about that, maybe [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=903.0s)]
*  you should think about who's [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=904.72s)]
*  telling you the truth and [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=906.2s)]

*  Waz, what do you think? [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=909.12s)]
*  Just a couple of things. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=911.48s)]
*  I like that John brought up 2001 and [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=913.2800000000001s)]
*  2002 time where right now with [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=916.12s)]

*  think we should invade Iraq, [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=927.0799999999999s)]
*  if you don't think we should start [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=929.0s)]
*  as many wars as possible, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=931.36s)]
*  you are a treasonous, traitorous, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=933.4s)]
*  bad American. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=936.16s)]
*  That's the cudgel that they use to [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=937.28s)]
*  silence people. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=939.4s)]
*  And what I would say about Trump is [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=940.52s)]
*  like, yes, he's horrible, but [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=942.68s)]
*  all of the stuff that he's doing [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=944.76s)]
*  has precedence in previous [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=946.68s)]

*  the next president's. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=950.12s)]

*  I think is so important to [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=953.68s)]

*  of presidential power. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJN4RgUTEfI&t=968.44s)]
