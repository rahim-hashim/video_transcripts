On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.
Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.
Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

# The Latest Trump Grift JUST DROPPED
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ijPcvoQY)
*  Are you tired of your wireless carrier? Do you want a plan capped at 20 gigabytes of data? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ijPcvoQY&t=0.0s)]
*  If so, Trump mobile might be right for you. That's right, the latest Trump grift just dropped and [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ijPcvoQY&t=6.96s)]
*  it's a Trump branded phone and wireless plan. We have more but first, Cenk, are you thinking [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ijPcvoQY&t=13.76s)]
*  about making the switch? Yeah, well, I really needed a golden phone. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ijPcvoQY&t=19.2s)]
*  I hope that this is made in America, wink. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ijPcvoQY&t=23.84s)]
*  Let's get into the details and find out. The Trump Organization on Monday unveiled a mobile phone [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ijPcvoQY&t=27.759999999999998s)]
*  and a mobile phone plan and a $499 smartphone that is set to launch in September. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ijPcvoQY&t=37.84s)]
*  The new service, Trump Mobile, will offer a $47.45 per month plan that includes unlimited [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ijPcvoQY&t=45.36s)]
*  talk, text and data as well as roadside assistance and a telehealth and pharmacy [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ijPcvoQY&t=53.44s)]
*  benefit according to its website. So what about the phone itself? This is where I was [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ijPcvoQY&t=58.8s)]
*  really interested. According to their site, the T1 phone runs on Android, the Android operating [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ijPcvoQY&t=64.8s)]
*  system has a fingerprint and face unlock capability and other features typically found in smartphones. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ijPcvoQY&t=72.32s)]
*  But as you're looking at this mock up, you may think, hey, this looks kind of cheap and awful. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ijPcvoQY&t=78.72s)]
*  And would you be surprised if I told you that tech reporters had the exact same reaction? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ijPcvoQY&t=86.08s)]
*  This piece from David Pierce in The Verge is hysterical and he offered an excellent take down. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ijPcvoQY&t=92.96s)]
*  All we have is a website that was clearly put together quickly and somewhat sloppily. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ijPcvoQY&t=100.64s)]
*  A promise that the phone is, quote, designed and built in the USA that I absolutely do not believe. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ijPcvoQY&t=106.08s)]
*  A picture that appears to be nearly 100% Photoshopped and a list of specs that don't [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ijPcvoQY&t=112.88s)]
*  make a lot of sense together. There's no processor listed, even though there's a section for it on [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ijPcvoQY&t=119.28s)]
*  the site. And processors are pretty important. Even without that, as far as I can tell, there's [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ijPcvoQY&t=125.52s)]
*  not a single phone currently on the market that matches these specs. All that aside, though, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ijPcvoQY&t=131.84s)]
*  there are still a thousand things we don't know about the T1, starting with what does it actually [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ijPcvoQY&t=137.92000000000002s)]
*  look like? Will it be waterproof or durable anyway? Why are the corners of the case so off color? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ijPcvoQY&t=143.84s)]
*  Why are there three rear cameras so weirdly spaced apart? Why does the top of the phone in the render [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ijPcvoQY&t=151.2s)]
*  look more like an iPhone than an Android device? Is it actually going to come with a Trump mobile [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ijPcvoQY&t=158.4s)]
*  background and will people be able to change it? What kind of heinous bloatware, spyware, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ijPcvoQY&t=164.4s)]
*  crypto scams are going to come built into this thing? If this is the T1 model 8002, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ijPcvoQY&t=170.0s)]
*  what happened to the first 8001 tries? Despite the obvious flags, Trump Mobile claims the T1 [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ijPcvoQY&t=176.72s)]
*  phone will be available in September. So Cenk, now are you convinced? Now will you be pre-ordering? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ijPcvoQY&t=184.72s)]
*  Yeah, and of course they added, it's all made in America. And every tech reporter is like, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ijPcvoQY&t=191.76s)]
*  there's no chance it's made in America. Okay, there's only one set of phones that are made [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ijPcvoQY&t=197.12s)]
*  in America. They're much more expensive than this, not close, right? But it's Trump, like A, lying is [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ijPcvoQY&t=201.84s)]
*  the most normal thing in the world. And B, trying to scam his own followers is Trump 101. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ijPcvoQY&t=209.68s)]
*  How many liberals do you think are going to buy this phone? I've got it at approximately zero. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ijPcvoQY&t=218.08s)]
*  Progressives, centrists, I've got it all at zero. So this is specifically for MAGA. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ijPcvoQY&t=223.36s)]
*  So he thinks MAGA will believe it. I've got a nice little community of suckers here. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ijPcvoQY&t=232.24s)]
*  And if I tell them that we're gonna go to war on behalf of Israel after I said anti-war, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ijPcvoQY&t=239.36s)]
*  they'll believe it. That one hasn't worked out exactly right. But he thinks if I tell him to buy [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ijPcvoQY&t=244.16000000000003s)]
*  this damn phone, whether it exists or doesn't, they'll believe it. I tell them it's made in [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ijPcvoQY&t=250.4s)]
*  America, they'll believe it. And then they'll waste their money on this thing. And that way, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ijPcvoQY&t=256.24s)]
*  I won't be screwing over the left, I'll be screwing over my own voters. You must be so proud. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ijPcvoQY&t=260.24s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's extremely funny how with so many of these products, they give you a terrible [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ijPcvoQY&t=269.52000000000004s)]
*  render, terrible mock-up at the beginning, a down the line release date. And then the disclaimer, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ijPcvoQY&t=276.40000000000003s)]
*  well, it might look a little bit different later. Yeah, there's no processor listed. How do you [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ijPcvoQY&t=283.6s)]
*  think this thing's going to operate? I kind of feel bad for people who buy this stuff. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ijPcvoQY&t=288.88s)]
*  It's the type of people who would get the jitterbug. Those are the people they're going [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ijPcvoQY&t=296.15999999999997s)]
*  after, not realizing that there's no way you can. Also what they're promising in some of these specs [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ijPcvoQY&t=300.32s)]
*  that would cost significantly more than $500. Also, if you're making it in America, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ijPcvoQY&t=306.8s)]
*  it would have to be more than $500. The only reason iPhones are 13, 1400 is because they're [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ijPcvoQY&t=313.36s)]
*  made in China. It would be significantly more. So I don't know. I just feel like this is one of the [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ijPcvoQY&t=319.52s)]
*  products that will not happen. Or they're just going to stamp Made in America on some cheap [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ijPcvoQY&t=326.71999999999997s)]
*  Android phones they get off of like Alibaba and try to pass it off as American made, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ijPcvoQY&t=333.44s)]
*  which it wouldn't put it past them. Because all this is is Trump just licensing his name [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ijPcvoQY&t=338.56s)]
*  to another company. Ironically, that's like the old school Chinese model, like get your Gucci here [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ijPcvoQY&t=342.96s)]
*  and get your Vendi, get your LV. Sure, sure, right? But you kind of stole my thunder there. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ijPcvoQY&t=349.52s)]
*  I think there's a good chance this never gets released. And if you don't know, then why bother? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ijPcvoQY&t=357.35999999999996s)]
*  They want to collect your names and information and sell it to another carrier. And that actually [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ijPcvoQY&t=363.68s)]
*  would be valuable. And they could make a lot of money doing that, even if they don't produce a [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ijPcvoQY&t=370.24s)]
*  single phone. And really, are people going to hold them accountable? I mean, all this avalanche of [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ijPcvoQY&t=375.12s)]
*  crazy stuff that Trump does. Is anybody going to come back three years from now and go, hey, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ijPcvoQY&t=380.72s)]
*  you know what? They never did make that phone. I wonder what they did with it. Right, they made a [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ijPcvoQY&t=385.12s)]
*  lot of money selling your information to another carrier. Every time you ring the bell below, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ijPcvoQY&t=388.96s)]
*  an angel gets a swings. Totally not true, but it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-ijPcvoQY&t=393.12s)]
