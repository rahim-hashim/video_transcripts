"California is the greatest state in the USA. It breaks my heart that the state I thrived in‚Äîpeople can't afford to live and dream here like I did. My party... our party... let this happen to the people who we gave trust to, to fight for us. My customers are single moms. The graduates who can't pay their student loans, let alone save for a house. The teachers who have to pay for school supplies. None of this had to happen. We ALL allowed this to happen... PLEASE LISTEN CAREFULLY: The good news is WE can fix it... only if WE REFUSE to elect the same people that are responsible for doing it. CALIFORNIA needs a Fighter who listens and works for its customers. HARD TRUTHS!¬© "

TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.
The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.
On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.
Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.
Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.
TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.
TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.
TYT‚Äôs 24/7 programming is available on YouTube TV, Samsung TV, Plus, Roku, Xumo, TCLtv+, Fubo, and more.

*  People ask me that question, but [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=54.56s)]
*  I've been around politics for [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=56.2s)]

*  character, he's got fun websites [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=99.32s)]
*  and URLs and his website in fact [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=101.88s)]
*  is californiageataclu.com as [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=104.28s)]
*  a cloo.com. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=106.84s)]
*  Okay, we've got a song from him [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=108.0s)]
*  about getting a clue too, but [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=110.0s)]
*  hold we'll get to that. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=111.8s)]
*  Okay, so first, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=114.0s)]
*  how'd you build up your businesses? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=114.72s)]
*  Well, school of hard knocks, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=116.48s)]
*  just learning in the street. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=118.56s)]
*  I never went to business school, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=120.68s)]
*  I think we've discussed this and [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=122.52000000000001s)]
*  with our friendship. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=124.28s)]
*  Mike Milken actually taught me [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=126.08s)]
*  business, I got my business degree [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=128.12s)]
*  from Mike Milken and I got my [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=130.48000000000002s)]
*  political policy degree from [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=132.28s)]
*  the great late Senator Harry Reid [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=134.0s)]
*  and Bill Clinton. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=136.04s)]
*  So it's learning in the street. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=137.32s)]
*  I mean, I was trained to be [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=138.6s)]
*  a surgeon, a doctor. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=140.16s)]
*  I have a degree in neurobiopsychology [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=142.44s)]
*  and I thought I was going to be [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=143.92000000000002s)]
*  a heart surgeon and pivoted. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=145.08s)]
*  So I learned pivoting in and [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=146.16s)]
*  just learning in the street. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=148.0s)]
*  There is a path if you have [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=150.07999999999998s)]
*  a purpose and if you enjoy what you [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=151.52s)]
*  do. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=153.35999999999999s)]
*  How do you find a company that you [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=154.12s)]
*  think will be successful? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=156.12s)]
*  Like what are the keys to building [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=157.6s)]
*  a company that winds up doing as [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=159.92s)]
*  well as your company's? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=162.04s)]
*  Well, I think it all comes down to [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=164.56s)]
*  seeing where there's distress and [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=167.6s)]
*  why companies are in distress. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=170.92s)]
*  It's usually being run by leaders [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=174.0s)]
*  that don't have the passion to [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=176.0s)]
*  lead it by not taking a hard look [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=177.4s)]
*  at why a company has failed. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=180.16s)]
*  It's usually simply poor operating [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=182.88s)]
*  in the form of leadership in [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=185.8s)]
*  the team and giving the customer [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=187.96s)]
*  what they want. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=190.4s)]
*  Listen to your customer. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=192.04s)]
*  And if you listen to that customer, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=193.76s)]
*  they will tell you the pathway to [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=195.68s)]
*  success, just follow it. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=197.32s)]
*  Well, the politicians could use [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=200.12s)]
*  that if they listen to their [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=201.72s)]
*  voters, that would be great. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=202.88s)]
*  Well, that in itself is one of the [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=204.32s)]
*  reasons I'm running because I did [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=206.76s)]
*  not intend to do this. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=209.35999999999999s)]
*  This was not on my bucket list. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=211.51999999999998s)]
*  I interviewed every single [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=213.04s)]
*  candidate and I came back and [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=214.28s)]
*  I said this is the best we got. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=215.76s)]
*  And I saw there was a lack of [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=218.04s)]
*  understanding of the customer. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=219.76s)]
*  So I polled with Frank Luntz, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=222.2s)]
*  the customer of California. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=223.84s)]
*  And they told me what they were [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=225.68s)]
*  looking for and I made that into [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=227.4s)]
*  deliverables for the customer, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=229.16s)]
*  giving them equal or greater value. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=231.0s)]
*  Yeah, so when you talk about Frank [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=233.32s)]
*  Luntz and Michael Milken and [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=235.55999999999997s)]
*  Harry Reid, people wonder what [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=237.51999999999998s)]
*  side of the Democratic Party you're [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=239.51999999999998s)]
*  on, right? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=241.88s)]
*  Because Democratic Party split and [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=242.64s)]
*  you're also a Democratic donor. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=244.83999999999997s)]
*  And that's- [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=247.0s)]
*  Almost four decades. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=247.6s)]
*  And that's why you talked to all [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=248.83999999999997s)]
*  those candidates before because [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=250.23999999999998s)]
*  you were thinking of potentially [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=251.64s)]
*  supporting one of them, right? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=253.11999999999998s)]
*  So to help us understand, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=254.44s)]
*  there's progressives, there's, and [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=256.68s)]
*  these labels are always mishmash and [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=259.71999999999997s)]
*  people mean different things by [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=262.36s)]
*  them. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=263.96000000000004s)]
*  But there's more moderate or [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=264.48s)]
*  conservative or [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=265.88s)]
*  business-oriented Democrats, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=266.72s)]
*  etc. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=268.36s)]
*  Where are you on the spectrum? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=268.88s)]
*  It's real simple. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=270.40000000000003s)]
*  I'm in the hard center. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=271.92s)]
*  People confuse me whether I'm [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=274.24s)]
*  a Republican or a Democrat, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=275.88s)]
*  I'm a lifelong Democrat. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=277.40000000000003s)]
*  But I've not changed, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=279.44s)]
*  the party changed. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=280.68s)]
*  And that social experiments failed. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=282.08000000000004s)]
*  And it's funny, people say, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=284.32s)]
*  you seem to the center to [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=286.0s)]
*  the right. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=287.40000000000003s)]
*  And I'm like, well, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=287.96000000000004s)]
*  I grew up on the end of a cul-de-sac. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=289.16s)]
*  And when you get to that end, and [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=291.6s)]
*  it's the far left end, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=293.6s)]
*  when you turn around, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=295.12s)]
*  everything looks right. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=296.52s)]
*  And that's actually the right [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=298.44s)]
*  reason I'm running and [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=300.08s)]
*  the right decisions for [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=301.2s)]
*  where we're going in California. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=302.48s)]
*  Because everything is going to look [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=304.72s)]
*  right because we went so far left [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=306.6s)]
*  when you turn around, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=308.48s)]
*  it's the way it is. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=309.72s)]
*  So tell me where you think it went [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=312.28s)]
*  too far left. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=313.68s)]
*  Well, look, we forgot about respect [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=315.0s)]
*  of the California customer. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=317.16s)]
*  We forgot about being responsible [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=319.24s)]
*  to the customer and showing results. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=321.12s)]
*  And we forgot about, as Democrats, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=323.76s)]
*  how to execute, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=327.08s)]
*  how to be accountable. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=328.15999999999997s)]
*  You have to know your numbers for [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=329.8s)]
*  us not to know where the money has [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=331.4s)]
*  gone. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=333.08s)]
*  You'd fail in business in a week, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=334.28s)]
*  and not to enforce the laws [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=337.04s)]
*  of our land. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=338.88s)]
*  And we got too much into putting [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=341.04s)]
*  band-aids on situations. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=343.08s)]
*  Those in leadership that we've [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=345.2s)]
*  allowed to be in leadership, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=346.71999999999997s)]
*  have never signed the front of [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=349.0s)]
*  a check. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=350.48s)]
*  And they don't understand how [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=351.0s)]
*  difficult it is to actually do [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=352.6s)]
*  business in California because [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=354.16s)]
*  they've never done business. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=355.68s)]
*  And they think also they're smarter [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=357.32s)]
*  than us. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=359.96000000000004s)]
*  And they also think it's their [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=361.56s)]
*  money, but it's our money. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=362.84000000000003s)]
*  So, Stephen, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=364.6s)]
*  when you get into too far left, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=365.24s)]
*  there's a lot of different ways [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=366.6s)]
*  that people can interpret that. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=367.96000000000004s)]
*  So there's identity politics, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=369.16s)]
*  for example, and [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=370.72s)]
*  people think that's too far left. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=371.56s)]
*  Then there's economic populism, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=373.48s)]
*  as some people think [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=375.24s)]
*  that's too far left. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=376.16s)]
*  I like economic populism. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=377.32s)]
*  Okay, so there's different [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=378.84000000000003s)]
*  gradations, right? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=380.6s)]
*  But one thing that you point out [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=383.04s)]
*  that I think maybe a lot of people [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=384.96000000000004s)]
*  agree with, and I don't know, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=387.04s)]
*  and I'm not sure that it depends [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=388.88s)]
*  where they are in the political [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=390.68s)]
*  spectrum is the accountability. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=392.40000000000003s)]
*  Where's the money, right? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=394.44s)]
*  So if we spent $24 billion on [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=396.2s)]
*  homelessness, where is it? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=398.24s)]
*  Where are the receipts? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=400.88s)]
*  And for these leaders not to know [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=402.0s)]
*  and say we need to have an audit, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=404.2s)]
*  you and I both know being in [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=407.12s)]
*  business, if we need to do [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=408.32s)]
*  an audit, there's serious problems. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=409.36s)]
*  We know where the dollars are, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=411.56s)]
*  maybe not down to the 0.01 penny, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=413.8s)]
*  but we're damn as close. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=416.32s)]
*  And we know where the receipts are [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=418.64s)]
*  because we authorize [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=420.68s)]
*  the expenditures. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=421.88s)]
*  They have had such bravado, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=424.15999999999997s)]
*  the leaders that we've elected to [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=425.92s)]
*  this point, to not even pay [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=427.88s)]
*  attention, and they play the blame [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=429.56s)]
*  game, and when you play the blame [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=431.72s)]
*  game, there's deeper problems. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=433.72s)]
*  You as a leader must stand and [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=435.52s)]
*  take those hard bullets coming into [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=437.47999999999996s)]
*  you and make sure your team gets [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=439.84s)]
*  the trophy, but they want the [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=442.03999999999996s)]
*  trophies. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=444.12s)]
*  You can't get a trophy unless you [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=445.84s)]
*  show results to the people, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=447.2s)]
*  unless our streets are clean, and [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=448.56s)]
*  it's really simple. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=450.03999999999996s)]
*  If we got potholes and [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=450.96s)]
*  our streets are ripping apart, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=452.08s)]
*  we got problems. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=453.68s)]
*  If the 405 freeway or as they say [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=455.28s)]
*  up north, well actually the 405 [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=457.32s)]
*  doesn't go up north, the five. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=459.44s)]
*  If the highways are clean up north [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=461.96s)]
*  and they're not clean in the south [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=464.04s)]
*  and it's all under Caltrans, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=465.88000000000005s)]
*  the state leadership, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=467.44000000000005s)]
*  there's a problem. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=468.76000000000005s)]
*  Leadership. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=470.40000000000003s)]

*  about politicians, right? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=473.0s)]
*  One is they set policy, but [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=474.04s)]
*  then the other is that they have to [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=475.52000000000004s)]
*  actually manage the government. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=477.20000000000005s)]
*  So whether it's the mayor of LA, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=479.24s)]
*  for example, or the position you're [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=480.84000000000003s)]
*  going for governor of California. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=482.64000000000004s)]
*  So we do a lot of analysis of [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=484.56s)]
*  their policy positions. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=486.36s)]
*  So here in California, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=488.24s)]
*  we generally vote Democrat, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=489.88000000000005s)]
*  obviously, right? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=491.84000000000003s)]
*  And because we do care about [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=493.6s)]
*  the homeless and we do want them to [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=494.88s)]
*  be taken care of in a humane way. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=496.64000000000004s)]
*  So but the second half we barely [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=499.32000000000005s)]
*  ever talk about, which is how good [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=501.12s)]
*  are you at executing those [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=503.20000000000005s)]
*  policies, right? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=504.72s)]
*  And actually getting the job done [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=506.28000000000003s)]
*  and actually helping homeless [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=507.96000000000004s)]
*  people and the community, right? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=509.44s)]
*  And you could do both at [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=511.12s)]
*  the same time. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=512.2s)]
*  Actually fighting crime, but not [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=513.16s)]
*  abusing black and brown people, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=515.28s)]
*  etc. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=517.36s)]
*  So how are you going to get people [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=518.0400000000001s)]
*  to focus on that management and [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=520.0400000000001s)]
*  that you think the Democrats in [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=522.16s)]
*  California are not doing well? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=524.24s)]
*  Well, look, I bring unbridled [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=526.4399999999999s)]
*  authenticity with warmth and [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=530.4399999999999s)]
*  compassion because I've operated [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=534.12s)]
*  that way my entire career. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=538.4s)]
*  I've tried to sit in a room of [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=541.12s)]
*  ultra-maga Republicans I don't fit [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=543.56s)]
*  in. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=546.76s)]
*  I actually have so [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=548.56s)]
*  many skill sets a person of my [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=550.16s)]
*  experience would even think of [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=552.72s)]
*  running for office because they're [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=555.4s)]
*  afraid of the media, which I'm not. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=558.2s)]
*  because I've been on undercover [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=560.72s)]
*  boss four times and [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=562.2s)]
*  always done a lot of television. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=563.04s)]
*  I'm selfless, I serve. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=564.84s)]
*  I'd rather ask you what you'd like [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=566.28s)]
*  for dinner, cooking for you, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=568.24s)]
*  serve it to you, sit down and [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=570.2s)]
*  have a great conversation and [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=571.92s)]
*  clean your plate. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=573.72s)]
*  I'm built to serve, where if you [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=575.4s)]
*  look at some of the ultra [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=578.3199999999999s)]
*  Republican MAGA folks, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=580.36s)]
*  they're built to critique and [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=582.4399999999999s)]
*  want to be served. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=584.8399999999999s)]
*  So we're a party, a Democratic [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=586.68s)]
*  party of service minded individuals. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=588.9599999999999s)]
*  What we've forgotten about is [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=591.76s)]
*  the balance sheet income statement, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=593.64s)]
*  performance and results. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=596.0799999999999s)]
*  And I plan on creating the [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=597.9599999999999s)]
*  California Department of Performance [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=599.24s)]
*  and Results, also as known as CPR, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=601.24s)]
*  which we need. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=603.28s)]
*  Yeah, see, that's clever and [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=605.0799999999999s)]
*  we actually do need it. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=606.6s)]
*  So speaking of that, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=608.08s)]
*  what makes you a Democrat? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=609.4000000000001s)]
*  You're proud to be [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=611.2800000000001s)]
*  a lifelong Democrat, why? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=612.32s)]
*  What is it about the Democratic [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=614.12s)]
*  party that resonated with you and [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=615.96s)]
*  has you fighting for your whole [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=617.88s)]
*  life, especially given that you're [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=619.72s)]
*  a little bit more on the conservative [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=621.9200000000001s)]
*  side of the Democratic party? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=624.0s)]
*  Service and inclusiveness, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=626.0s)]
*  protection, Papa Bear, fighter, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=628.6800000000001s)]
*  which hardly exists in [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=631.6800000000001s)]
*  the Democratic party, but [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=633.2s)]
*  it's a spillover from Harry Reid. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=634.9200000000001s)]
*  And it's really simple, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=637.44s)]
*  I would rather serve than be [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=640.0400000000001s)]
*  served. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=642.7600000000001s)]
*  And that's really the [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=645.2s)]
*  distinguishable characteristic and [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=646.48s)]
*  being inclusive. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=648.8800000000001s)]
*  It's living in the world of [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=650.8000000000001s)]
*  integrity, we don't lie. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=652.44s)]
*  And these are values that I have [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=656.0400000000001s)]
*  and I find those on the ultra [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=658.12s)]
*  Republican, even with Donald Trump, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=660.0400000000001s)]
*  the guy has no values, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=662.44s)]
*  I've got values, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=663.9200000000001s)]
*  the guy's got no integrity, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=665.12s)]
*  I pay my contractors, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=667.16s)]
*  I create value, he destroys value. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=668.76s)]
*  So it's distinguishable and [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=673.04s)]
*  I just don't fit into that side. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=675.24s)]
*  I'm a lifelong Democrat, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=678.7199999999999s)]
*  I'm loyal and I'm proud. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=680.1999999999999s)]
*  But I even have to fight with those [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=681.8399999999999s)]
*  in my party because guess what? [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=683.76s)]
*  I've aspired to my dreams and [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=686.0s)]
*  fulfilled them and I want everyone [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=687.56s)]
*  to have those dreams too. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=689.48s)]
*  And I'm not afraid of leaning into [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=691.0s)]
*  that, I'm not afraid of saying I've [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=692.72s)]
*  been successful and I'm proud of it. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=694.52s)]
*  Yeah, so but Steven, then some [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=696.56s)]
*  would say, okay, look, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=698.52s)]
*  you're also a donor and [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=699.9599999999999s)]
*  you've given a good amount. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=701.28s)]
*  You do philanthropy too. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=703.3199999999999s)]
*  A lot of philanthropy. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=704.68s)]
*  Right, but you also donate to [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=705.4399999999999s)]
*  Democratic politicians. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=707.4s)]
*  And oftentimes they did try to serve [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=709.56s)]
*  the donor class and [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=711.8399999999999s)]
*  it didn't work out. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=713.16s)]
*  So some say, including me, by the [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=714.9599999999999s)]
*  way, that donors have too much [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=717.4s)]
*  influence in the Democratic Party. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=719.52s)]
*  Well, how do you respond to that? [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=722.16s)]
*  Well, look, there have been times [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=723.88s)]
*  over the last 39 years where I [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=726.2800000000001s)]
*  said, you know what, enough. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=728.2800000000001s)]
*  I'm out and I keep getting brought [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=730.52s)]
*  back in to either fix the problems [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=732.76s)]
*  of the politicians that could not [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=735.0400000000001s)]
*  be fixed and serving. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=737.36s)]
*  And we have to all show up, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=739.72s)]
*  we can't say they caused it, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=742.2s)]
*  we all caused it, okay? [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=745.36s)]
*  We have to accept responsibility [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=749.44s)]
*  for where we are today and [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=751.0400000000001s)]
*  if we don't like it, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=752.2800000000001s)]
*  collectively fix it together. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=753.28s)]
*  We have to do this. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=755.56s)]
*  And I keep getting back to no [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=757.8399999999999s)]
*  finger pointing we. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=760.04s)]
*  And I think it's now my [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=762.56s)]
*  responsibility to actively show up [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=764.12s)]
*  and really, really help now. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=766.6s)]
*  Because I've got the free time. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=769.16s)]

*  in politics too. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=891.72s)]

*  it's okay. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=902.36s)]
*  Nobody takes it personally. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=903.84s)]
*  It's you become self deprecating [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=904.8s)]
*  and you want to laugh at me out [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=906.68s)]
*  kids fine. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=908.2s)]

*  You're not a perfect man. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=910.24s)]
*  Nobody's perfect. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=911.04s)]
*  And it's okay. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=912.4s)]
*  But we want everyone to do well. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=914.08s)]
*  And yeah, the song is kitschy and [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=916.36s)]
*  it's cute and who cares? [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=918.28s)]

*  your governor's office? [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=923.72s)]

*  Jeff could certainly run that. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=942.08s)]

*  if you do things that are catchy, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=980.96s)]
*  you get people's attention and [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=983.88s)]
*  then get them to focus on [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=985.28s)]
*  your policies, right? [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=986.28s)]
*  100%, and look, in all seriousness, [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=987.24s)]
*  we have a policy to fix the [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=989.6800000000001s)]
*  insurance crisis. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=991.32s)]
*  It's on our website already, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=992.64s)]
*  tip to tail. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=994.52s)]
*  It was crafted for me talking to [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=995.28s)]
*  all the insurance companies. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=997.28s)]

*  And then I talked to the [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1000.44s)]
*  insurance association and [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1001.6800000000001s)]
*  I studied Proposition 103 to see if [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1003.12s)]
*  we could live within it. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1004.96s)]
*  And the corrections were very [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1007.08s)]
*  similar to what I did at Diamond [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1008.64s)]
*  Resorts from Santero to Diamond [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1010.32s)]
*  Resorts, a worldwide company. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1012.04s)]

*  a country and having a financial [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1014.76s)]
*  fix with a legislative fix and [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1016.44s)]
*  living within the regulation. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1018.12s)]
*  So the regulatory fix too. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1019.9200000000001s)]
*  And no other politician would think [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1023.08s)]
*  this out because they haven't done [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1025.1200000000001s)]
*  it. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1027.1200000000001s)]
*  So if I look at the competitive [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1027.64s)]
*  landscape, I have a fix for [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1029.24s)]
*  the entertainment industry already. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1030.64s)]

*  these are all exports of our state [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1035.44s)]

*  Okay, so come on. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1284.96s)]
*  Okay, AC knows his material. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1285.56s)]
*  Okay, but if you caught some where [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1287.1599999999999s)]
*  they say, well, [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1289.08s)]
*  I want to make more money. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1290.04s)]
*  And then there's, but [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1291.32s)]
*  there is a real regulation. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1292.48s)]
*  Because- And they're for [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1294.0s)]
*  a reason. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1294.96s)]
*  And then what you do to our [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1295.48s)]
*  customers in California, [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1296.9199999999998s)]
*  explain to them, we do have [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1298.48s)]
*  regulations to keep bad actors out. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1300.04s)]
*  And that's it. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1302.96s)]
*  And this happens to be one of those [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1303.8s)]
*  regulations. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1304.8799999999999s)]
*  because we always want to keep bad [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1306.04s)]
*  actors out. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1307.1999999999998s)]
*  Regulations are good. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1307.72s)]
*  I was in highly regulated [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1308.6s)]
*  businesses, real estate, [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1310.1599999999999s)]
*  insurance, banking, and gambling. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1312.0s)]
*  So I've been in highly regulated [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1315.24s)]
*  business. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1317.0s)]
*  I liked regulation as long as it [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1317.52s)]
*  was fair regulation. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1319.56s)]
*  Okay, that's interesting. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1321.8799999999999s)]
*  So and is California overregulated [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1323.12s)]
*  from time to time? [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1325.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1326.6s)]
*  Well, there's over 380,000 [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1327.12s)]
*  regulations in this great state [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1329.1599999999999s)]
*  country. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1331.1999999999998s)]
*  It's too much, please. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1331.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1332.6399999999999s)]
*  And so it's always a balancing act [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1333.48s)]
*  of where to draw. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1335.0s)]
*  But here, I'll try an example real [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1335.68s)]
*  quick, palisades. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1337.4s)]
*  So people want to rebuild right [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1338.88s)]
*  away, and also other parts of LA [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1340.4s)]
*  that burned down too, obviously. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1342.04s)]
*  And so, but at the same time, [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1344.0s)]
*  you got to be careful in how you [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1345.4s)]
*  rebuild this. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1346.8s)]
*  An easy example is when you're [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1347.44s)]
*  building an office building in [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1349.16s)]
*  California, you have to have [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1350.88s)]
*  earthquake standards. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1352.48s)]
*  Seismic. Yeah. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1353.92s)]
*  Yeah, I'm a builder. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1354.64s)]
*  Yeah, so how do you balance that [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1355.48s)]
*  out? [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1357.24s)]
*  If you were- Well, look, [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1357.76s)]
*  we would be silly to allow [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1359.4s)]
*  somebody to build what was built [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1361.44s)]
*  in the 1920s out of stick with [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1364.1200000000001s)]
*  eaves without the proper sprinklers. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1366.96s)]
*  We need to build reinforced [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1370.56s)]
*  housing that can withstand. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1372.6000000000001s)]
*  And some areas probably, [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1374.88s)]
*  there shouldn't be homes built. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1376.64s)]
*  Mm-hm. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1378.72s)]
*  Right? [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1379.28s)]
*  So things change. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1379.8400000000001s)]
*  We need to pivot. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1381.28s)]
*  No mandates, but [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1382.56s)]
*  we need to pivot smartly because [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1383.6000000000001s)]
*  there are certain areas where [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1385.48s)]
*  maybe there's no more, [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1387.16s)]
*  there's no more, [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1388.4s)]
*  maybe there's no more, [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1390.0s)]
*  insurers won't cover that area. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1391.08s)]
*  So supply and demand and market [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1393.44s)]
*  conditions are going to govern [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1395.2s)]
*  what should be the future of [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1396.96s)]
*  a certain area. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1398.6s)]
*  We need to follow those things, [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1400.28s)]
*  not buck those trends, right? [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1401.68s)]
*  Okay, so some balance on [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1403.24s)]
*  regulation, but in the beginning, [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1404.52s)]
*  you're looking for overregulation [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1406.4s)]
*  that has prevented businesses from [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1408.1200000000001s)]
*  coming to California more. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1409.8s)]
*  100%. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1411.2s)]
*  We need to open California backup [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1411.72s)]
*  for business so it's affordable, [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1413.4s)]
*  livable, and workable. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1415.2s)]
*  So how do you, I mean, [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1416.48s)]
*  there's one problem in California [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1417.84s)]
*  that people will focus on the most [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1420.24s)]
*  is housing, right? [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1422.48s)]
*  Affordability. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1424.0s)]
*  Just out of control on [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1424.72s)]
*  affordability. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1425.9199999999998s)]
*  So how do you tackle that? [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1426.8799999999999s)]
*  Well, you've got some impediments, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1428.3999999999999s)]
*  CEQA, for example, [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1431.48s)]
*  which is overregulation of any type [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1433.24s)]
*  of building in the state. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1436.08s)]
*  You also have wildlife, okay, [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1438.36s)]
*  which people don't talk about, [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1440.52s)]
*  the Species Act in California. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1442.52s)]
*  You also have the Coastal Commission. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1445.1599999999999s)]
*  And I think they have been allowed [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1446.9199999999998s)]
*  to be weaponized, okay, [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1449.28s)]
*  to impede businesses from growing [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1451.28s)]
*  and expanding. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1453.9599999999998s)]
*  And it causes market conditions [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1455.8799999999999s)]
*  such that you have unknown risk [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1458.08s)]
*  factors and people end up spending [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1460.28s)]
*  a lot more than they should [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1462.56s)]
*  compared to other states, [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1464.32s)]
*  because we've overregulated [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1466.04s)]
*  ourselves. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1467.8799999999999s)]
*  So if our great governor, [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1468.6399999999999s)]
*  Gavin Newsom, was able to pause [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1471.28s)]
*  CEQA, then we would have [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1474.48s)]
*  Coastal Commission and Wildlife for [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1476.92s)]
*  the Palisades and the Eaton Fire. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1480.0s)]
*  Good, then I'm going to absolutely [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1482.8s)]
*  mandate an affordability emergency [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1485.28s)]
*  in the entire state of California [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1487.8799999999999s)]
*  and pause all these. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1490.28s)]
*  He just did it for LA, I'll do it [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1491.84s)]
*  for the entire state until new [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1493.8799999999999s)]
*  legislation is written that can [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1495.84s)]
*  accommodate future sustainable [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1498.08s)]
*  growth. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1500.12s)]
*  So we'll talk to me about that [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1500.84s)]
*  because sometimes they lift [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1502.32s)]
*  regulations, especially in LA. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1503.76s)]
*  And they say, [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1505.56s)]
*  we're going to get more housing. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1506.3600000000001s)]
*  And then we do get more housing, [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1507.68s)]
*  super expensive housing built in [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1509.64s)]
*  the middle of West LA that people [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1511.76s)]
*  can't afford anyway. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1514.0s)]
*  So, okay, how do we, like if we [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1515.64s)]
*  just leave it in the hands of the [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1517.24s)]
*  real estate companies, they're [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1518.8s)]
*  going to want to maximize profit. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1520.48s)]
*  They're going to build the most [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1521.88s)]
*  expensive housing, etc. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1523.4s)]
*  So how do we get past that problem? [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1524.84s)]
*  Well, we're going to have to [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1527.48s)]
*  create a department within [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1529.1200000000001s)]
*  California, not a department that [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1530.8s)]
*  costs us money, that actually [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1533.08s)]
*  allows us to grow profitably, okay? [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1535.28s)]
*  And that's really in performance [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1537.72s)]
*  and results. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1539.6s)]
*  It's really on the expense line. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1540.32s)]
*  I mean, it's not even on the top [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1541.92s)]
*  line, it's on performance and [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1543.3999999999999s)]
*  results. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1544.84s)]
*  Because we need to improve the [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1545.36s)]
*  number of homes built in California [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1546.92s)]
*  that are affordable, okay? [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1548.8799999999999s)]
*  So if we go ahead and pause the [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1550.48s)]
*  issue that doesn't allow us to [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1553.68s)]
*  build quickly and profitably, [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1556.8799999999999s)]
*  because there's risk associated [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1560.1599999999999s)]
*  with it, you can weaponize CEQA and [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1563.04s)]
*  the Wildlife Act. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1565.68s)]
*  Any union or not in my backyard, [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1567.48s)]
*  the NIMBY folks can kind of [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1569.88s)]
*  protest. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1571.76s)]
*  In the old days, I used to build [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1573.44s)]
*  in the 80s in 120 days, [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1575.56s)]
*  get a pull a permit, 120 days. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1577.24s)]
*  And then pull my demolition permit [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1579.4s)]
*  and then pull my structural permit [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1582.08s)]
*  and then pull my electrical, [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1584.92s)]
*  mechanical plumbing. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1587.44s)]
*  And all of a sudden we're finished. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1589.44s)]
*  You can't do that today because [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1591.84s)]
*  they want everything front loaded [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1593.84s)]
*  with assessment fees and costs and [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1596.12s)]
*  every I dot and T crossed. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1598.4399999999998s)]
*  And that creates extraordinary [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1600.36s)]
*  expense and unknown time of risk. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1602.96s)]
*  Interesting, all right, [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1605.72s)]
*  two more policy questions. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1607.24s)]
*  One is about crime. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1608.9199999999998s)]
*  So California has a rich history of [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1610.28s)]
*  being accused of being too soft on [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1612.04s)]
*  crime and too tough on crime with [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1613.6799999999998s)]
*  three strikes and you're out. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1615.24s)]
*  So where do you land on that? [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1617.0s)]
*  It's really simple. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1618.12s)]
*  I've got a problem with the budget [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1619.72s)]
*  right now in California, [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1621.68s)]
*  the balance sheet and [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1623.24s)]
*  income statement when we reduce [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1624.64s)]
*  the prison population by 38%. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1626.64s)]
*  And the budget goes up $3 billion. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1628.72s)]
*  Can you figure out that math? [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1633.44s)]
*  Yeah, it's a lot of math to figure [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1635.24s)]
*  out in California. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1636.96s)]
*  Okay, well, okay, [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1638.28s)]
*  that's pretty obvious. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1639.2s)]
*  We got to figure that out. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1640.24s)]
*  And then if we are letting these [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1641.64s)]
*  folks out of the state penitentiaries [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1643.0s)]
*  and we just pushing them down to [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1644.64s)]
*  the cities and counties, [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1646.04s)]
*  what has to be a holistic approach [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1647.4s)]
*  to it? [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1649.24s)]
*  Good leaders would understand [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1650.2s)]
*  50,000 feet and into the weeds. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1652.1200000000001s)]
*  And I think the leaders that we've [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1654.72s)]
*  elected don't understand all that [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1656.28s)]
*  because they're not operators. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1657.76s)]
*  So would they? [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1659.1200000000001s)]
*  And then let's finish. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1660.0s)]
*  So and then when you're talking [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1661.24s)]
*  about crime, look, we went from [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1663.28s)]
*  Prop 47 to 36. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1665.68s)]
*  And our leadership didn't listen [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1671.56s)]
*  to customer because the customer [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1673.2s)]
*  said they wanted 36 to the point of [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1674.68s)]
*  70% and they fought it tooth and [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1676.24s)]
*  nail. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1677.8s)]
*  But in my book, [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1679.02s)]
*  36 doesn't go far enough. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1679.8999999999999s)]
*  That's interesting. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1682.22s)]
*  So just real quick for [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1683.1s)]
*  the audience, if you don't know, [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1683.86s)]
*  especially if you're not from [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1685.06s)]
*  California, 47 turned some [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1686.1s)]
*  felonies into misdemeanors and so [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1687.7s)]
*  reduced the sentencing on some of [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1689.58s)]
*  those crimes, but [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1691.5s)]
*  it was kind of hidden. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1692.54s)]
*  They didn't actually put it in [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1694.3s)]
*  the ballot measure. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1695.4199999999998s)]
*  So I voted on that and [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1696.4199999999998s)]
*  I had no idea because it was not in [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1697.46s)]
*  the bill at all in the description [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1699.1s)]
*  to the voters at all. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1700.6599999999999s)]
*  And so then the California voters [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1702.02s)]
*  rebelled and they did Prop 36. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1704.06s)]
*  They said, no, no, no, [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1706.46s)]
*  don't put them back into felonies. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1707.34s)]
*  There's too much crime, right? [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1708.58s)]
*  And they also still allowed it to [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1710.34s)]
*  be okay to steal up to $950. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1712.78s)]
*  And that's the part you [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1716.82s)]
*  would get tougher on? [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1717.5s)]
*  Not in my book. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1718.7s)]
*  What would happen if we were kids [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1719.86s)]
*  and we stole a piece of candy? [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1721.22s)]
*  Would you be more terrified of [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1723.34s)]
*  the police officer or your father? [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1724.62s)]
*  My father, definitely. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1726.8999999999999s)]
*  You're going to kick my ass. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1728.54s)]
*  We don't steal. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1731.18s)]
*  Eighth commandment, [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1732.22s)]
*  we just don't steal. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1733.1399999999999s)]
*  So we're going to have to make some [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1734.94s)]
*  hard decisions here because this [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1736.7s)]
*  goes into my book too, [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1738.42s)]
*  Facing Hard Truths. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1739.7s)]
*  These are real. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1740.9s)]
*  Do we want to live in a civil [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1742.46s)]
*  society where we can debate one [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1744.46s)]
*  another civilly? [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1746.9s)]
*  Do we want to have safe streets, [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1748.7s)]
*  safe homes, safe schools, [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1750.78s)]
*  safe workplaces? [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1752.6200000000001s)]
*  And get value for our tax dollars? [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1753.8200000000002s)]
*  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1756.98s)]
*  So we have to have that bravado in [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1759.14s)]
*  the hard center which [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1760.7s)]
*  hasn't existed and [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1761.6200000000001s)]
*  I'm bringing it back. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1762.5s)]
*  Bravado in the hard center. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1764.0600000000002s)]
*  Okay, that's an interesting [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1765.62s)]
*  positioning. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1767.2199999999998s)]
*  So lastly on policy homelessness. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1768.1399999999999s)]
*  So, but it's not that we didn't [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1770.06s)]
*  have big hearts in California. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1771.4199999999998s)]
*  We did, we gave a lot of money, but [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1772.7399999999998s)]
*  unfortunately homelessness has gone [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1774.86s)]
*  up instead of down. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1776.8999999999999s)]
*  So you're the governor, [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1778.1s)]
*  what do you do in terms of where's [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1779.86s)]
*  the money? [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1782.1399999999999s)]
*  How do we allocate it properly? [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1783.62s)]
*  How do we actually solve this [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1785.1799999999998s)]
*  thing? [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1786.78s)]
*  Good question and I've been [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1788.34s)]
*  involved in the homeless crisis for [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwZ_MOrPVg8&t=1789.78s)]
