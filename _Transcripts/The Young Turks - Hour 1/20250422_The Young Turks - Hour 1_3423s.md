# Neocon Job - April 22, 2025
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [April 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw)
*  They can begin! [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=0.0s)]
*  Welcome to the Young Turks. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=30.0s)]
*  There we are, okay, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=32.6s)]
*  something's happening. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=34.04s)]
*  All right, Jake Uygur, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=35.72s)]
*  Ana Conspiren with you guys. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=37.0s)]
*  I'm here in New York at [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=38.6s)]
*  the Spotify studios, do something [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=40.120000000000005s)]
*  exciting here in New York soon. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=42.44s)]
*  Ana's in LA and we've got an amazing [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=44.72s)]
*  show for you guys. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  So Israel is unfortunately out of [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=49.44s)]
*  control and it has kind of swallowed [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=52.28s)]
*  up the show today, but [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=55.36s)]
*  that's because it's kind of [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=57.32s)]
*  swallowing up our government and [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=59.24s)]
*  foreign policy. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=61.84s)]
*  So a lot to discover there in terms [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=63.64s)]
*  of what's been happening and [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=65.52s)]
*  explain some of the mysteries that [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=67.16s)]
*  we were starting to talk about [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=69.2s)]
*  yesterday. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=71.0s)]
*  So Ana, what do you got for us? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=71.76s)]
*  Well, let's start off with an [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=73.6s)]
*  update on the purge within [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=75.2s)]
*  the Defense Department. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=76.6s)]
*  This is a story that we covered in [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=78.28s)]
*  great detail yesterday. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=80.0s)]
*  We talked about the various [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=81.56s)]
*  figures, including those very close [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=82.9s)]
*  to Pete Hegseth who have had [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=84.84s)]
*  a long term relationship with [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=86.52s)]
*  Pete Hegseth, essentially getting [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=88.16s)]
*  pushed out of the Defense [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=90.08s)]
*  Department. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=91.6s)]
*  And so let's just say that that [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=92.52s)]
*  story has developed further. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=94.32s)]
*  Without further ado, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=96.6s)]
*  let's get into it. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=97.68s)]
*  People knew that you weren't fully [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=99.8s)]
*  on board with the regime change [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=101.4s)]
*  program and then I read all of [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=102.8s)]
*  a sudden that you're a traitor. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=104.4s)]
*  You're like marched out of [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=107.32s)]
*  the Pentagon. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=108.64s)]
*  You did make just from an outsider's [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=109.48s)]
*  perspective one maybe career [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=111.88s)]
*  mistake by giving on the phone to [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=113.92s)]
*  you, but you were giving on [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=116.12s)]
*  the record interviews before you [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=117.67999999999999s)]
*  went in describing your foreign [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=119.67999999999999s)]
*  policy views, which I think are [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=121.6s)]
*  fully within the mainstream of [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=123.56s)]
*  the world and the US, but out of [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=125.52s)]
*  the mainstream among warmongers. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=127.36s)]
*  We were threatening a lot of [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=129.64s)]
*  established interests in our own [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=131.44s)]
*  separate ways and we had people [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=133.6s)]
*  who had personal vendettas against [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=135.64s)]
*  us. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=137.96s)]
*  But you're being accused of [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=138.5s)]
*  betraying Hegseth, who's under [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=140.44s)]
*  attack from people who want to war [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=142.52s)]
*  want about it. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=144.88s)]
*  In reality, it appears that [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=149.52s)]
*  is the one who has betrayed his [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=151.68s)]
*  longtime friends who were in [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=153.44s)]
*  the Defense Department until [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=155.16s)]
*  recently. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=156.96s)]
*  And in fact, Tucker Carlson had [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=157.96s)]
*  a chat with Dan Caldwell, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=160.12s)]
*  one of the officials who ended up [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=161.88s)]
*  getting fired from the Defense [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=164.0s)]
*  Department. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=166.12s)]
*  He was a close advisor to Pete [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=167.0s)]
*  Hegseth and there were allegations [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=168.92000000000002s)]
*  that the reason that he was let go [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=171.16s)]
*  along with two other individuals is [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=173.32s)]
*  because they were allegedly leaking [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=175.84s)]
*  classified information to reporters. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=178.4s)]
*  Now, the department hasn't provided [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=181.56s)]
*  any evidence of that. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=183.52s)]
*  In fact, these individuals are now [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=184.64s)]
*  going to sue the department because [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=186.64s)]
*  they claim there was no [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=188.68s)]
*  investigation into our conduct. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=190.08s)]
*  We weren't given any polygraph [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=192.48s)]
*  tests. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=194.32s)]
*  We don't know why we're getting [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=195.36s)]
*  pushed out. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=196.76s)]
*  This is wrongful termination. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=197.28s)]
*  Now the two others who were fired [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=199.16s)]
*  from the Pentagon jank were [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=201.08s)]
*  Colin Carroll and Darren Selnick. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=202.56s)]
*  These are two other individuals who [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=205.23999999999998s)]
*  say they've never leaked anything [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=207.04s)]
*  to the press and in fact, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=208.84s)]
*  they've been very close to Pete [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=210.12s)]
*  Hegseth, huge cheerleaders for [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=211.67999999999998s)]
*  the Trump administration. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=213.32s)]
*  It's just that their opinions on [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=214.79999999999998s)]
*  foreign policy seem to differ from [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=217.12s)]
*  what the war machine military [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=219.39999999999998s)]
*  establishment wants and likes. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=221.44s)]
*  And so we're going to get into [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=223.76s)]
*  some of those details in just [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=225.16s)]
*  a moment. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=226.76s)]
*  But this was a huge interview that [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=227.35999999999999s)]
*  had quite a few revelations that I [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=229.32s)]
*  think the audience will enjoy [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=231.36s)]
*  learning about. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=233.0s)]
*  Yeah, so this now begins to [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=234.36s)]
*  explain what was the mystery [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=236.16s)]
*  yesterday. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=238.12s)]
*  And it's not surprising. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=240.48s)]
*  In fact, I thought we did a pretty [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=241.72s)]
*  good job of sussing out what it [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=243.48s)]
*  might be on yesterday's edition of [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=244.96s)]
*  the Young Turks. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=246.8s)]
*  Obviously you can watch it live at [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=248.0s)]
*  6 o'clock Eastern every day on [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=249.96s)]
*  YouTube and get the podcast on [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=251.8s)]
*  Spotify, which is where I am today. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=253.72s)]
*  So what didn't make sense was why [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=256.6s)]
*  would Pete Hegseth be the one [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=258.92s)]
*  who would bring in allies that he's [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=261.08s)]
*  had for at least a decade and [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=263.64s)]
*  then fire them within a couple of [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=265.64s)]
*  months? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=267.91999999999996s)]
*  Because remember, these are not [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=268.76s)]
*  left over Biden people, Hegseth [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=271.12s)]
*  brought them in. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=273.47999999999996s)]
*  So then two, three months later, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=274.47999999999996s)]
*  abrupt firing. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=276.71999999999997s)]
*  So that didn't make any sense at [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=278.03999999999996s)]
*  all. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=279.76s)]
*  So and he keeps talking about [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=280.28s)]
*  the deep state. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=281.68s)]
*  We'll get to that in a second. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=282.52s)]
*  But wait a minute, how could they [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=283.59999999999997s)]
*  be deep state if you brought them [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=285.79999999999995s)]
*  in? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=288.03999999999996s)]
*  Are you deep state? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=288.56s)]
*  So that part doesn't make any sense [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=290.36s)]
*  at all. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=291.84000000000003s)]
*  Now the fact that there might be [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=292.36s)]
*  something akin to a deep state is [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=293.72s)]
*  beginning to make sense. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=295.08s)]
*  But it doesn't make sense that the [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=296.52000000000004s)]

*  It makes a lot more sense that [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=299.52000000000004s)]
*  the deep state were the ones who [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=301.08s)]
*  fired him. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=302.64s)]
*  But isn't that amazing that it's [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=303.32s)]
*  Hegseth's allies and they're [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=305.12s)]
*  getting fired from underneath him? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=306.84000000000003s)]
*  And he has to pretend it's about [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=309.24s)]
*  a leak and now we know definitively [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=310.84000000000003s)]
*  that it isn't, that it was they [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=312.52s)]
*  didn't offer a polygraph test. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=314.08000000000004s)]
*  They had no evidence, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=316.04s)]
*  they didn't even take [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=316.84000000000003s)]
*  their computers. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=317.56s)]
*  We know all of this now. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=318.40000000000003s)]
*  So, but yes, there are neocons [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=319.4s)]
*  within the government. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=322.44s)]
*  And I think this is an enormous [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=324.56s)]
*  story. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=326.44s)]
*  And yes, we have enormously strange [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=327.59999999999997s)]
*  bedfellows, Tucker Carlson and [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=329.4s)]
*  today Steve Bannon talking about [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=330.88s)]
*  similar things. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=332.52s)]
*  But you know what, if ever there [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=333.64s)]
*  was a time and a cause to unite [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=335.32s)]
*  the left and the right, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=336.88s)]
*  it would be this to stop a war with [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=338.2s)]
*  Iran that the neocons want to drive [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=340.23999999999995s)]
*  us into. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=342.4s)]
*  And let's be honest, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=343.71999999999997s)]
*  to satiate Israel, not this country. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=344.96s)]
*  So let's talk about the cover [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=348.08s)]
*  story briefly before we get to [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=349.48s)]
*  the meat of this story. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=350.96s)]
*  So defense officials told Politico [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=352.16s)]
*  last week that the investigation [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=354.32s)]
*  centered around a series of leaks [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=356.44s)]
*  including the deployments of [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=358.56s)]
*  carriers to the Red Sea. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=360.52s)]
*  Elon Musk's visit to the Pentagon [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=362.16s)]
*  for a security briefing and [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=364.24s)]
*  the pause of US intelligence to [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=366.12s)]
*  Ukraine. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=368.28000000000003s)]
*  Now, Caldwell, Dan Caldwell, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=370.12s)]
*  who was a close advisor to Pete [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=371.56s)]
*  Hegseth and was pushed out of [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=372.96s)]
*  the Defense Department recently, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=374.2s)]
*  insisted that the untold story was [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=375.92s)]
*  that his controversial views had [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=378.08s)]
*  made him a target. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=380.15999999999997s)]
*  And I happen to believe him. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=382.12s)]
*  I think the story that he tells [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=384.12s)]
*  here is definitely believable. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=385.8s)]
*  And to really understand why [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=388.12s)]
*  Caldwell believes that he was [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=389.71999999999997s)]
*  falsely accused of being a leaker [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=391.4s)]
*  and pushed out of the Trump [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=393.2s)]
*  administration as a result, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=394.64s)]
*  we have to kind of delve into his [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=396.28s)]
*  foreign policy views, which [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=398.0s)]
*  unfortunately happened to be pretty [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=399.64s)]
*  novel within the Defense Department. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=401.68s)]
*  Let's take a look. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=404.24s)]
*  Risks being incredibly costly in [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=405.88s)]
*  terms of lives and dollars and [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=408.96s)]
*  instability in the Middle East. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=411.68s)]
*  The idea that it could become [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=415.04s)]
*  a major war is kind of absent from [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=416.44s)]
*  American news accounts. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=418.08s)]
*  So the idea is that the United [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=419.15999999999997s)]
*  States probably in partnership with [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=421.24s)]
*  Israel or vice versa Israel in [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=423.76s)]
*  partnership with the United States [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=425.92s)]
*  would take out the I think six [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=428.56s)]
*  Iranian nuclear sites and [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=430.8s)]
*  that would kind of be the end of [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=432.92s)]
*  that it wouldn't become a major [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=436.03999999999996s)]
*  war. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=437.32s)]
*  I mean, I don't think I've ever [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=438.08s)]
*  read any account that suggests it [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=439.52s)]
*  could become a major war, but [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=441.28s)]
*  you're saying it could. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=442.55999999999995s)]
*  Look, when the minute that the [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=443.79999999999995s)]
*  bombs or bullets start flying, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=445.71999999999997s)]
*  you can never say with certainty [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=447.67999999999995s)]
*  what exactly is going to happen. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=449.52s)]
*  Yeah. But I think that because of [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=451.28s)]
*  The fact that Iran has been put on [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=457.67999999999995s)]
*  its back foot and Iran is weakened, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=460.03999999999996s)]
*  they've had a lot of failures in [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=462.67999999999995s)]
*  the past, I think that actually [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=465.68s)]
*  creates an opportunity for more and [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=467.6s)]
*  better diplomacy. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=469.8s)]
*  But there's some who argue that [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=471.2s)]
*  creates an opportunity for [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=472.92s)]
*  more military action. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=474.32s)]
*  In fact, if you go back to the New [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=475.6s)]
*  York Times reporting last week [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=478.16s)]
*  about what was thought of as [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=480.72s)]
*  an impending military strike [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=482.96000000000004s)]
*  against Iran, which by the way, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=485.6s)]
*  Trump actually decided against [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=488.52000000000004s)]
*  engaging in. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=491.12s)]
*  Caldwell, he's a very, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=492.16s)]
*  Is part of a small group of people [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=495.32s)]
*  within the Defense Department or [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=497.0s)]
*  at least he was a part of a small [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=498.68s)]
*  group of people within the Defense [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=500.28000000000003s)]
*  Department who saw the weakening [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=502.08s)]
*  of Iran as an opportunity to [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=504.24s)]
*  engage in diplomacy and [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=506.04s)]
*  get a nuclear deal signed as [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=507.88s)]
*  opposed to engaging in a hot war [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=510.08s)]
*  with Iran. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=512.68s)]
*  Now the war machine within [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=513.72s)]
*  the Defense Department very much [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=515.6s)]
*  wants that war. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=517.96s)]
*  But what was so surprising about [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=519.24s)]
*  that reporting last week, Cenk, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=521.28s)]
*  was that among the individuals in [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=523.72s)]
*  the Trump administration who were [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=525.96s)]
*  against doing military strikes [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=528.1600000000001s)]
*  along with Israel against Iran, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=530.36s)]
*  were Tulsi Gabbard, which I'm [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=532.5200000000001s)]
*  going to give her a lot of credit [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=534.5600000000001s)]
*  for, VP JD Vance, going to give [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=536.5600000000001s)]
*  him credit for that as well. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=538.7600000000001s)]
*  But included in that group was [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=541.48s)]
*  actually Secretary of Defense Pete [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=543.2800000000001s)]
*  Hegseth, who has this Neocon [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=545.5600000000001s)]
*  history. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=547.5200000000001s)]
*  So I was actually really surprised [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=549.1600000000001s)]
*  to see that he was one of the [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=551.1600000000001s)]
*  people in Trump's ear discouraging [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=552.84s)]
*  him from going along with what [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=555.2s)]
*  Israel wanted, which was to engage [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=557.1600000000001s)]
*  in these strikes against the [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=559.6800000000001s)]
*  nuclear targets in Iran. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=561.84s)]
*  And so that's making me really [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=565.0400000000001s)]
*  rethink the way I perceive some of [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=566.96s)]
*  the stories that are coming out [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=569.12s)]
*  about Pete Hegseth and all these [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=571.0s)]
*  other individuals who have been [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=572.88s)]
*  purged from the Defense Department [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=574.76s)]
*  in recent days. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=576.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so there's something that's [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=577.92s)]
*  a really interesting phenomenon [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=581.56s)]
*  here and that is not just about [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=584.9599999999999s)]
*  this story, but that really goes [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=588.3199999999999s)]
*  to the heart of what is a deep [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=591.8s)]
*  state of the story, and [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=595.12s)]
*  that's what we're going to be [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=597.64s)]
*  talking about in this next [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=600.7199999999999s)]
*  episode of The New York Times. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=603.52s)]
*  What does a deep state mean? [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=606.68s)]
*  If they exist, who are they? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=608.52s)]
*  And how do they have this much [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=612.08s)]
*  power? [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=613.16s)]
*  So here's why I say that. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=614.0s)]
*  So we report on that story that [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=616.0s)]
*  Anna is referring to last week on [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=617.76s)]
*  the Young Turks. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=619.52s)]
*  And I said huge credit to [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=620.4s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard, by the way, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=622.08s)]
*  huge credit to Donald Trump for [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=623.4s)]
*  not doing the strike against Iran. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=624.84s)]
*  Israel already pressured him. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=626.48s)]
*  Netanyahu came to America to [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=628.64s)]
*  pressure him into attacking Iran [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=630.3199999999999s)]
*  on behalf of Israel. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=632.24s)]
*  And we showed you the story where [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=633.52s)]
*  Israel decided, you know what, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=635.5200000000001s)]
*  our planes can't do this attack. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=637.24s)]
*  So we're going to order America to [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=639.08s)]
*  do it. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=640.5200000000001s)]
*  And right, and we can't really [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=641.0400000000001s)]
*  fully handle the defense, so [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=642.32s)]
*  we're going to order America to do [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=643.6800000000001s)]
*  the defense after we start the war. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=645.32s)]
*  And so Trump, for now, said no, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=647.72s)]
*  great, okay. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=650.24s)]
*  Hegseth is on the side, it appeared [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=651.9200000000001s)]
*  based on New York Times reporting [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=654.12s)]
*  of Gabbard and JD Vance saying no [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=656.24s)]
*  to the strike. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=658.4000000000001s)]
*  So then who's firing the guys under [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=660.08s)]
*  Hegseth? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=662.0400000000001s)]
*  Who are his allies? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=662.5600000000001s)]
*  Because it doesn't look like [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=664.2399999999999s)]
*  Hegseth's firing them. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=666.0s)]
*  I mean, even if he's technically [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=667.68s)]
*  firing them, why would he? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=669.4399999999999s)]
*  They're the guys he brought in. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=671.0s)]
*  And like a minute ago, so [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=673.4799999999999s)]
*  that doesn't make sense. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=674.68s)]
*  Trump said no to the Iran strike [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=675.88s)]
*  and is generally clueless about [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=677.3599999999999s)]
*  what's going on in his [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=678.8399999999999s)]
*  administration. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=679.76s)]
*  So I don't think he necessarily [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=680.7199999999999s)]
*  gave the direct orders to fire [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=682.1999999999999s)]
*  these guys. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=683.4799999999999s)]
*  So who the hell is giving the order [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=684.3599999999999s)]
*  to fire these guys who are hardcore [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=686.88s)]
*  MAGA, hardcore Hegseth supporters [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=689.52s)]
*  from underneath Hegseth? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=692.88s)]
*  See, that's super interesting. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=694.8000000000001s)]
*  So how does the, I mean, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=696.6400000000001s)]
*  if such a thing as the deep state [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=698.0400000000001s)]
*  exists, how do they do that? [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=699.84s)]
*  Who are they? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=701.88s)]
*  And how do they pressure Hegseth to [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=703.24s)]
*  actually commit to, yes, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=705.2s)]
*  I'm the one who fired them. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=706.72s)]
*  Yes, it's because of this made up [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=708.72s)]
*  story about leaks, etc. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=710.2800000000001s)]
*  How do they get them to do that? [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=711.9200000000001s)]
*  And I don't know. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=713.0s)]
*  Yeah, that is a good question. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=714.9200000000001s)]
*  I should say that in an interview [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=716.24s)]
*  recently with Brian Kilmeade on [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=718.4000000000001s)]
*  Fox News, unfortunately, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=720.48s)]
*  Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth did [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=722.44s)]
*  not defend his friends, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=725.0s)]
*  including Caldwell, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=726.6800000000001s)]
*  who actually worked for Hegseth at [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=728.3000000000001s)]
*  an organization known as Concerned [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=730.6800000000001s)]
*  Veterans for America. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=733.1600000000001s)]
*  They had a close relationship. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=734.8800000000001s)]
*  Caldwell wrote an op-ed in [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=736.6s)]
*  town hall. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=738.2800000000001s)]
*  I'm sorry, he wasn't the one who [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=739.7600000000001s)]
*  wrote an op-ed in town hall, but [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=740.7600000000001s)]
*  he was one of the individuals who [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=742.0s)]
*  was really rooting for Hegseth to [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=743.36s)]
*  become Secretary of Defense. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=744.96s)]
*  They are not enemies in any way. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=747.24s)]
*  They never had any kind of negative [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=748.6800000000001s)]
*  relationship. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=750.36s)]
*  But someone, you're right, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=751.6800000000001s)]
*  someone or a group of people got [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=753.16s)]
*  rid of Caldwell along with other [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=754.8000000000001s)]
*  individuals who have some ideas [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=756.44s)]
*  about foreign policy that don't go [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=758.04s)]
*  along with the neoconservative [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=759.8000000000001s)]
*  ideology. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=761.4s)]
*  And now you have Hegseth essentially [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=761.92s)]
*  providing cover for the decision to [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=764.6s)]
*  fire these individuals because I [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=767.28s)]
*  think he realizes, wow, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=769.76s)]
*  my job is really on the line. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=771.42s)]
*  Just yesterday we shared the story [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=773.04s)]
*  about how there are some rumors [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=774.8000000000001s)]
*  about how the White House is [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=776.36s)]
*  already looking for [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=777.72s)]
*  replacement for Pete Hegseth. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=778.6800000000001s)]
*  So now that he's afraid about [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=780.16s)]
*  losing his job, maybe he's willing [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=781.5s)]
*  to throw his friends under the bus. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=783.2s)]
*  But nonetheless, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=785.0s)]
*  later in the interview, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=786.04s)]
*  Caldwell also said, quote, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=787.36s)]
*  I think there clearly is a very [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=789.04s)]
*  strong coalition within the United [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=790.74s)]
*  States that wants to see another [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=792.84s)]
*  war in the Middle East and [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=794.64s)]
*  it crosses both parties preach. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=796.28s)]
*  I mean, I think we all know that, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=798.52s)]
*  but the fact that he references [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=800.96s)]
*  this bipartisan support for [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=803.12s)]
*  more war in the Middle East really [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=805.04s)]
*  goes to the point where he says, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=807.36s)]
*  The point he's trying to make about [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=809.88s)]
*  why he believes he was actually [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=811.64s)]
*  fired. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=813.24s)]
*  And so, look, why is it that [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=813.74s)]
*  Caldwell does not believe that he [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=815.56s)]
*  was actually fired for being [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=817.8s)]
*  a suspect in leaking classified [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=819.8s)]
*  information to reporters? [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=822.02s)]
*  Well, he explains part of it in [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=824.9s)]
*  this next clip. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=826.46s)]
*  Let's take a look. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=827.4s)]
*  So I just want to be totally [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=829.36s)]
*  direct with you. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=830.72s)]
*  Did you leak classified information [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=831.76s)]
*  against the wishes of your [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=833.8s)]
*  superiors to media outlets? [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=835.1999999999999s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=837.0799999999999s)]
*  Did you photograph classified [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=838.48s)]
*  material and then text pictures of [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=840.22s)]
*  that material to an NBC news [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=842.2s)]
*  reporter? [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=843.8000000000001s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=844.8000000000001s)]
*  And I have not spoken to an NBC [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=845.84s)]
*  reporter while at the Pentagon. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=848.08s)]
*  Do you know what you've been [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=851.36s)]
*  accused of? [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=853.84s)]
*  No, I don't. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=855.36s)]
*  Sitting here right now, myself and [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=856.6800000000001s)]
*  Darren Selnick and Colin Carroll, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=858.6800000000001s)]

*  escorted out of the Pentagon, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=862.76s)]
*  initially placed on leave and [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=864.36s)]
*  then fired on Friday. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=865.84s)]
*  We have not been told as of this [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=867.64s)]
*  recording, one, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=869.84s)]
*  is there what we were being [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=871.3199999999999s)]
*  investigated for? [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=873.28s)]
*  Two, is there still an [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=875.56s)]
*  investigation? [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=877.2s)]
*  And three, was there even [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=878.48s)]
*  a real investigation? [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=879.88s)]
*  Because there's a lot of evidence [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=881.08s)]
*  that there is not a real [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=882.8s)]
*  investigation. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=884.08s)]
*  We're going to get to some more [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=888.16s)]
*  details about why he doesn't [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=889.28s)]
*  believe there's been a real [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=890.52s)]
*  investigation into possible leakers [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=891.76s)]
*  within the Defense Department. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=893.48s)]
*  But before we get to that, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=894.96s)]
*  I just quickly remind you all that [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=896.12s)]
*  Mike Waltz, National Security [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=898.44s)]
*  Advisor to Donald Trump, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=900.84s)]
*  the guy who accidentally included [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=902.9200000000001s)]
*  Jeffrey Goldberg in that Signal [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=905.48s)]
*  Chat where they're discussing [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=907.8000000000001s)]
*  a military operation against [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=909.96s)]
*  the Houthis in Yemen. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=911.88s)]
*  That guy, that guy, he's still [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=913.4000000000001s)]
*  employed by the Trump [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=915.4000000000001s)]
*  administration. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=916.6s)]
*  Interesting how that guy is still [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=918.48s)]
*  employed by the Trump [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=920.1600000000001s)]
*  administration considering his [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=921.2800000000001s)]
*  massive mistake. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=923.2800000000001s)]
*  But these individuals are fired [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=924.92s)]
*  under incredibly flimsy [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=927.12s)]
*  allegations, fascinating. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=928.8s)]
*  Yeah, and look, this is so [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=931.64s)]
*  interesting because it in a lot of [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=933.4399999999999s)]
*  ways unites the right and [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=935.72s)]
*  the left in terms of actual voters. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=937.4s)]
*  Because if you're a fan of Hegseth [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=940.4399999999999s)]
*  or you're anti-war and you voted [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=942.72s)]
*  for Trump because you thought he's [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=944.96s)]
*  anti-war, well, then you don't want [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=947.4s)]
*  these guys fired. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=949.72s)]
*  This is the anti-war contingent, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=950.96s)]
*  right? [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=952.88s)]
*  So, and if you're on the left, [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=953.4399999999999s)]
*  I sure hope to God you don't want [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=955.1999999999999s)]
*  war just because Trump's president [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=957.0799999999999s)]
*  and he hasn't declared one yet. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=959.24s)]
*  So of course the left is anti-war. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=961.24s)]
*  So we should all want to get to [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=964.68s)]
*  the bottom of what's going on here. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=966.68s)]
*  So why is Hegseth firing these guys [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=969.56s)]
*  when it's super obvious that he [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=972.48s)]
*  didn't want to? [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=975.3199999999999s)]
*  And this conversation about leaks [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=977.64s)]
*  is ridiculous. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=979.96s)]
*  They didn't do any investigation [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=981.32s)]
*  at all. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=983.5600000000001s)]
*  And remember, [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=984.4000000000001s)]
*  they're not firing lefties, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=985.0s)]
*  they're firing their own. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=986.36s)]
*  And to your point, Anna, [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=987.9200000000001s)]
*  about the cover story. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=989.24s)]
*  So wait, let me get this right. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=991.12s)]
*  There's no investigation of [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=992.96s)]
*  theoretical leaks from the Pentagon. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=994.6s)]
*  And there's no evidence connecting [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=996.88s)]
*  it to these anti-war guys inside [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=998.88s)]
*  the Pentagon, but [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1000.5600000000001s)]
*  they're immediately fired with no [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1001.6400000000001s)]
*  evidence and no investigation. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1003.6400000000001s)]
*  But we all know, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1005.36s)]
*  we saw with our own eyes, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1006.12s)]
*  we heard it with our own ears. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1007.2800000000001s)]
*  We saw Hegseth and Mike Walls and [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1008.92s)]
*  all those guys in the Signal Chat [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1011.16s)]
*  actually leaking national security [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1013.32s)]
*  information, top secret information [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1015.76s)]
*  about how we're going to strike. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1018.28s)]
*  So if you say this is accountability [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1020.48s)]
*  for leaks, how could there be no [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1021.92s)]
*  accountability for Walls who set up [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1023.32s)]
*  that group and included a reporter? [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1024.96s)]
*  How could there be no accountability [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1027.8s)]
*  for Hegseth, who's the one who [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1029.48s)]
*  actually gave the coordinates and [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1030.96s)]
*  the timing of the bombing, etc. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1032.52s)]
*  But there's accountability for [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1034.96s)]
*  people who are underneath them with [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1036.68s)]
*  no evidence and no investigation. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1038.72s)]
*  No, this has nothing to do with [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1040.36s)]
*  leaks. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1042.08s)]
*  It has everything to do with [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1042.76s)]
*  whether we're going to war with [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1044.12s)]
*  Iran or not. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1045.48s)]
*  And by the way, it's not just [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1046.48s)]
*  Israel that wants that war, [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1047.6399999999999s)]
*  the military industrial complex [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1048.72s)]
*  wants that war. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1050.08s)]
*  They're going to make a literal [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1050.84s)]
*  killing off of that. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1052.56s)]
*  I mean, that's going to affect [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1053.8799999999999s)]
*  hundreds of billions of dollars [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1055.44s)]
*  that they're going to make. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1057.12s)]
*  If you think that they're not [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1058.68s)]
*  motivated by that, you're probably [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1060.28s)]
*  just recently escaped from asylum or [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1062.28s)]
*  a national media report. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1064.36s)]
*  I just think it's fascinating. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1067.08s)]
*  Last week, it's reported by [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1068.32s)]
*  the New York Times that you have [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1069.86s)]
*  two camps within the Defense [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1071.6399999999999s)]
*  Department, they're both in Trump's [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1073.2399999999998s)]
*  ear, one side is encouraging him to [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1075.4799999999998s)]
*  do military strikes against Iran, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1077.56s)]
*  obviously with Israel by its side. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1079.8799999999999s)]
*  The other camp is saying, nah, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1082.04s)]
*  this is not a good idea, this is [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1084.08s)]
*  going to drag us into a hot war [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1085.9599999999998s)]
*  with Iran, you should avoid it. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1087.6799999999998s)]
*  And now you're seeing that side in [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1089.7199999999998s)]
*  particular being pushed out of [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1091.7199999999998s)]
*  the Defense Department. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1093.6s)]
*  By the way, what's also just so [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1095.6799999999998s)]
*  incredibly absurd is just how much [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1098.36s)]
*  access Caldwell had to incredibly [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1101.6799999999998s)]
*  top secret classified information [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1104.74s)]
*  up until the moment he was fired. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1107.6599999999999s)]
*  He talks about that in the next [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1110.32s)]
*  clip. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1111.36s)]
*  So there was this leak [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1113.56s)]
*  investigation that was ongoing for [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1115.1599999999999s)]
*  weeks, right? [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1117.6799999999998s)]
*  Was your access to classified [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1121.4399999999998s)]
*  information limited during that [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1123.32s)]
*  time? [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1125.08s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1125.58s)]
*  In fact, the day I was escorted [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1126.16s)]
*  out of the building, I went into, [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1128.34s)]
*  I won't get specific, [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1130.56s)]
*  the highest of high level [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1132.0s)]
*  intelligence briefings. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1133.56s)]
*  And up until the minute I was [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1135.3999999999999s)]
*  pulled out of my office, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1136.84s)]

*  the claim that you were leaking [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1148.84s)]
*  classified information? [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1150.68s)]

*  The reason I'm pressing on this is [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1169.3600000000001s)]
*  that doesn't make any sense. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1170.76s)]
*  Doesn't make any sense to me. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1172.24s)]
*  Yeah, it really doesn't make any [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1175.48s)]
*  sense. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1176.68s)]
*  So if the Defense Department [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1177.2s)]

*  the people who is a liability [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1180.36s)]

*  Because here we have, so [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1288.92s)]
*  one of our members is asking, and [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1290.6000000000001s)]
*  I'll address it in the social break [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1292.92s)]
*  when I read more of the comments, [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1295.2s)]
*  about Tucker Carlson. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1297.44s)]

*  No, no, no, guys, on other things, [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1300.44s)]
*  they don't make sense at all. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1302.0s)]
*  So like Steve Bannon, [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1303.5600000000002s)]
*  I mentioned earlier, and [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1304.72s)]
*  he's warning about the deep state [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1305.92s)]
*  in a similar way. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1307.5600000000002s)]
*  But then on another topic, [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1308.96s)]
*  on the Brieger Garcia topic, [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1310.44s)]
*  he's saying, [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1312.0800000000002s)]
*  let's suspend habeas corpus. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1312.92s)]
*  That's insane. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1314.6s)]
*  So, but at the same time, [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1315.48s)]
*  is Tucker good on this issue? [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1317.8s)]
*  Yes, unequivocally, absolutely. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1321.7199999999998s)]
*  And so if you say, no, [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1324.8s)]
*  I'm going to hate Tucker, [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1326.28s)]
*  even though he's clearly, [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1327.9599999999998s)]
*  you can see it with your own eyes, [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1329.7199999999998s)]
*  trying to stop a war with Iran. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1331.8799999999999s)]
*  Okay, but I'm trying to save lives. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1334.24s)]
*  And so I believe in positive [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1337.9599999999998s)]
*  change in the world. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1339.32s)]
*  So if Tucker has come to our [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1340.6s)]
*  position of being massively anti [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1342.1599999999999s)]
*  neo-con, no more wars in the Middle [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1344.04s)]
*  East, no more serving Israel. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1346.2s)]
*  Yes, I'll take yes for an answer, [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1348.96s)]
*  and God, we need those allies. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1350.68s)]
*  And that brother talking to him [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1352.84s)]
*  right there said that Tucker has [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1354.76s)]
*  been critical in pushing back [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1356.88s)]
*  against the idea of war with Iran. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1358.84s)]
*  And remember, guys, [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1361.2s)]
*  this is what I keep reiterating. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1362.48s)]
*  It's important for us to be in [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1364.56s)]
*  alliance with those guys on given [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1366.6s)]
*  topics that we agree on. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1368.92s)]
*  Why? [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1370.6s)]
*  Because Trump's not going to [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1371.68s)]
*  listen to us. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1373.0s)]
*  But he is listening to [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1373.8799999999999s)]
*  Tucker Carlson. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1375.08s)]
*  So I would much rather have [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1376.1999999999998s)]
*  Tucker Carlson as an ally on this [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1377.76s)]
*  than not have any allies on the [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1379.8799999999999s)]
*  right. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1381.8799999999999s)]
*  And it's a great day in America [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1383.08s)]
*  that some portions of the right [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1385.12s)]

*  wing talking points are, etc. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1394.52s)]
*  Because now bring it back to [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1396.6399999999999s)]
*  mainstream media. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1398.04s)]

*  the administration? [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1407.68s)]
*  Because they seem to be having [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1409.36s)]
*  a nonsense conversation. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1410.48s)]
*  So the Trump's team idea is, [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1411.48s)]
*  there was a day leaked and [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1413.56s)]

*  And with no evidence, [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1418.32s)]
*  we knew it was them. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1419.12s)]
*  Okay, so that story is nonsense, [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1419.8s)]
*  right? [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1421.32s)]
*  So by the way, [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1422.04s)]
*  what are the Democrats saying? [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1422.6399999999999s)]
*  Generally speaking, [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1423.8799999999999s)]
*  absolutely nothing because it's [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1425.04s)]
*  beloved Israel. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1426.8s)]
*  So they've all bowed their heads. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1427.92s)]
*  But if they're saying anything at [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1429.52s)]
*  all, the pushback is, [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1430.92s)]
*  Hegs is an idiot and drunk and [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1431.92s)]
*  etc. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1433.48s)]
*  And this is just his incompetence. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1434.3999999999999s)]
*  No, that doesn't make any sense [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1437.3999999999999s)]
*  at all. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1438.9199999999998s)]
*  You don't just throw away these [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1439.9199999999998s)]
*  friends and colleagues and allies [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1441.84s)]
*  from all this time within three [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1444.0s)]
*  months of you getting the job. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1446.0s)]
*  Because you're incompetent or [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1448.48s)]
*  you're, that doesn't make any sense. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1450.24s)]
*  No, nobody's that incompetent. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1452.52s)]
*  So both sides have an official [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1454.6s)]
*  story that is utter horse crap. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1456.52s)]
*  And is anyone in mainstream media [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1459.6s)]
*  calling them out? [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1461.12s)]
*  No one, no one. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1461.76s)]
*  So then it's super curious to see [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1463.24s)]
*  if people on the left like us and [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1465.2s)]
*  people on the right like Tucker [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1467.08s)]
*  Carlson can actually rally enough [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1468.88s)]
*  voters to create enough pressure on [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1470.92s)]
*  the Trump administration to push [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1473.04s)]
*  back against Israel's efforts here [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1475.1200000000001s)]
*  to drag us into this war. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1477.36s)]
*  And I don't know the answer to [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1479.44s)]
*  that. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1480.44s)]
*  I don't know that we have enough [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1480.96s)]
*  power. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1482.16s)]
*  I don't know that we have enough [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1482.68s)]
*  democracy to be able to do that. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1483.84s)]
*  But at least the battle is joined. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1485.52s)]
*  And so now maybe we have a fighter's [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1488.16s)]
*  chance, whereas we didn't in [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1490.1200000000001s)]
*  the Iraq war. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1491.68s)]
*  Because all we had was mainstream [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1492.52s)]
*  media monopoly that just did [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1494.32s)]
*  propaganda about how awesome and [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1495.72s)]
*  easy that Iraq war was going to be [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1497.44s)]
*  and how necessary it was. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1499.08s)]
*  So now we have mainstream media [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1500.96s)]
*  just kind of letting it lie and [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1503.16s)]
*  not sharing the truth with anyone. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1505.3600000000001s)]
*  But folks on both wings have, [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1508.24s)]
*  because of online media and [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1509.8s)]
*  independent media, have begun to [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1511.28s)]
*  realize this game is being played [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1513.2s)]
*  on you, soon they're going to send [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1515.0s)]
*  your kids to that war and [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1516.92s)]
*  certainly your money to finance [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1518.32s)]
*  that war. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1520.0s)]
*  I just want to say both things can [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1521.04s)]
*  be true. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1523.0s)]
*  So the cover story about how these [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1523.76s)]
*  people are being pushed out [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1525.84s)]
*  because they're allegedly leakers [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1527.48s)]
*  is a cover story, it's BS, right? [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1529.84s)]
*  I see that as separate to the issue [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1533.56s)]
*  of Pete Hegseth's incompetence. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1536.36s)]
*  Because his willingness to engage [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1539.12s)]
*  in detailed conversations about [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1542.1599999999999s)]
*  military operations on signal, [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1544.8799999999999s)]
*  not just the Signalgate story, [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1547.6399999999999s)]
*  that initially broke, but [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1550.8s)]
*  the fact that there was another [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1552.48s)]
*  separate signal chat that his wife, [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1554.28s)]
*  brother and lawyer were in on. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1556.6399999999999s)]
*  In which he's also sharing more and [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1558.68s)]
*  more of these sensitive military [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1560.92s)]
*  operations and details about it. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1563.16s)]
*  That does show a level of [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1565.96s)]
*  incompetence when it comes to [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1567.08s)]
*  Pete Hegseth. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1568.52s)]
*  So both things can be true at [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1569.08s)]
*  the same time. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1570.76s)]
*  But I think that Signalgate, [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1572.04s)]
*  to be honest with you, [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1574.32s)]
*  is being exploited by those who [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1576.08s)]
*  are not to push the anti-war [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1578.48s)]
*  component of the Defense Department [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1580.76s)]
*  out. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1583.88s)]
*  And I didn't think that Pete Hegseth [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1584.4s)]
*  was part of that group, but [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1586.6000000000001s)]
*  considering what the New York Times [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1588.3200000000002s)]
*  had reported just last week about [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1590.52s)]
*  how he was in the President's ear, [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1592.56s)]
*  advising him against doing these [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1594.68s)]
*  military strikes against Iran. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1596.52s)]
*  That makes me think, okay, well, [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1598.4s)]
*  Pete Hegseth has become a bit of [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1600.16s)]
*  a target as well. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1601.72s)]
*  So he could be a target, but [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1602.8s)]
*  he's also incompetent for [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1604.24s)]
*  the Signalgate issues and [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1605.6000000000001s)]
*  other issues. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1607.0800000000002s)]
*  So that's my take on that. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1608.0s)]
*  I want to just end with one final [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1609.32s)]
*  video. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1610.96s)]
*  Let's go to the last video in [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1611.48s)]
*  this segment because, [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1613.04s)]
*  Caldwell said a lot of really [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1614.4s)]
*  glowing things about Pete Hegseth [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1616.16s)]
*  in the context of this interview [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1618.16s)]
*  with Tucker Carlson. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1620.08s)]
*  And I just feel really bad about [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1621.48s)]
*  that because of the fact that Pete [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1623.36s)]
*  Hegseth then went on Fox News to [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1625.44s)]
*  say this. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1627.4s)]
*  Through that leak investigation, [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1628.52s)]
*  unfortunately, we found some folks [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1630.56s)]
*  that we believe were not holding to [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1632.76s)]
*  the protocols that we hold dear [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1634.88s)]
*  at the Defense Department. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1636.8s)]
*  Through that investigation, [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1638.32s)]
*  they have been moved on and [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1639.84s)]
*  that investigation continues. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1641.08s)]
*  Those folks who were leaking, [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1642.96s)]
*  who have been pushed out of [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1644.44s)]
*  the building, are now attempting to [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1645.72s)]
*  leak and sabotage the President's [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1647.48s)]
*  agenda and what we're doing. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1649.24s)]
*  And that's unfortunate. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1650.68s)]
*  It's not what I do. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1651.9199999999998s)]
*  It's not how we operate. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1653.0s)]
*  And so you've got another [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1654.32s)]
*  allegation being pushed again, [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1655.68s)]
*  not based on how we're operating [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1657.52s)]
*  around here. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1659.32s)]
*  You believe this came out, [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1660.28s)]
*  they said it was called Team Huddle. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1661.56s)]
*  Because, so one of the people work [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1663.44s)]
*  for you, one of the three who [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1665.12s)]
*  are longer are there, [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1666.6s)]
*  leaked this out as a way to get [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1668.02s)]
*  back at you. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1669.6399999999999s)]
*  That's right, Brian. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1672.12s)]
*  When you dismiss people who you [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1673.28s)]
*  believe are leaking classified [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1674.6399999999999s)]
*  information, and again, [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1676.0s)]
*  the investigation is ongoing and [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1677.1999999999998s)]
*  that will take time. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1678.6799999999998s)]

*  Brian, if those very same people [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1683.9199999999998s)]
*  keep leaking? [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1685.6s)]
*  I mean, that is some leftist level [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1688.8799999999999s)]
*  betrayal. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1690.3999999999999s)]
*  It's pretty incredible. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1690.9599999999998s)]
*  Cenk, back to you. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1691.9599999999998s)]
*  But if there's such leftists, [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1694.32s)]
*  why are they on Tucker Carlson's [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1696.24s)]

*  with them completely? [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1700.52s)]
*  So yeah, no, we're at a super [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1702.28s)]
*  interesting moment in American [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1704.48s)]
*  history. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1706.96s)]
*  Will we be pushed into this war [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1708.76s)]
*  with Iran because of a foreign [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1711.0s)]
*  government? [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1713.28s)]
*  And then if we are, [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1714.72s)]
*  what will be the consequences? [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1715.92s)]
*  At what point do we reach critical [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1718.32s)]
*  mass of enough people getting news [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1720.64s)]

*  I'm in a great interview with [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1739.8s)]
*  Jeffrey Sachs and Andrew Napolitano. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1740.96s)]
*  I mean, look at these strange bed [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1742.32s)]
*  fellows, but that's good. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1743.56s)]
*  That's how democracy should be. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1744.48s)]
*  It should be, hey, we agree on [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1746.08s)]
*  this and we don't agree on that. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1747.1599999999999s)]
*  And Jeffrey Sachs has always been [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1748.52s)]
*  a brilliant scholar. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1749.8s)]
*  We've totally disagreed with [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1750.56s)]
*  Napolitano in the past, but [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1751.8799999999999s)]
*  here we are, we all agree. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1753.36s)]
*  And Sachs and Napolitano are saying [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1754.96s)]
*  the same thing we are, which is, [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1756.56s)]
*  this is obviously Israel. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1758.0s)]
*  And they're not hiding it. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1759.72s)]
*  Israel definitely wants us to [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1761.16s)]
*  attack Iran. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1762.72s)]
*  Netanyahu says it publicly, and [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1763.68s)]
*  he's now applying incredible [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1765.72s)]
*  pressure. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1767.68s)]
*  And what form that pressure takes [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1769.0s)]
*  is also super interesting. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1771.32s)]
*  Why are they getting Hegsith? [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1773.76s)]
*  And how are they getting Hegsith to [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1775.64s)]
*  throw his own allies onto the bus? [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1777.56s)]
*  I don't know the answer to that, [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1780.24s)]
*  but if we ever find out, yeah, [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1781.8s)]
*  there's going to come a point [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1783.32s)]
*  where the American people are going [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1784.8s)]
*  to be fairly furious with Israel and [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1786.52s)]
*  how they've controlled our [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1788.28s)]
*  government. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1789.64s)]
*  But they keep poking the bear, [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1790.6000000000001s)]
*  poking the bear, and saying, [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1792.2s)]
*  that's okay. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1793.84s)]
*  We'll just make the sucker [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1794.68s)]
*  Americans fight one more war for [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1796.48s)]
*  us. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1798.72s)]
*  And maybe they could have tens of [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1799.48s)]
*  thousands of people were casualties [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1801.32s)]
*  like the Iraq war of Americans, [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1803.44s)]
*  let alone hundreds of thousands [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1805.28s)]
*  of Iraqis. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1807.08s)]
*  And this idea that Iran wants to be [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1807.96s)]
*  attacked, absurd. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1809.76s)]
*  Everything about this is absolutely [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1811.28s)]
*  absurd. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1812.88s)]
*  And which way is Trump going to go? [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1813.4s)]
*  I still don't know. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1814.68s)]
*  So, yeah, [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1816.28s)]

*  Well, we hear a lot about how [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1888.52s)]
*  Israel is the only democracy in [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1890.0s)]
*  the Middle East and [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1891.52s)]
*  it's our important ally. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1892.52s)]
*  But there's some drama that's been [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1894.24s)]
*  unfolding and it really does show [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1896.88s)]
*  that the government is willing to [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1899.32s)]
*  come down hard on anyone who is [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1901.6399999999999s)]
*  questioning Israel's foreign policy. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1903.8s)]
*  So let's talk about that a little [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1907.28s)]
*  bit. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1909.04s)]

*  Netanyahu is embroiled in yet [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1911.8s)]
*  another massive scandal of his own [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1913.56s)]
*  making, by the way. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1915.84s)]
*  Now in this case, the scandal [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1917.28s)]
*  involves him going after Israeli [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1919.3999999999999s)]
*  protesters. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1921.76s)]
*  And he's being called out by [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1922.96s)]
*  someone within the Israeli [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1924.96s)]

*  So the issue at play here is that [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1930.0800000000002s)]
*  there are Israelis within Israel [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1932.4s)]
*  who have been protesting Benjamin [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1935.04s)]
*  Netanyahu for a whole host of [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1937.6000000000001s)]
*  reasons. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1939.92s)]
*  I mean, of course, prior to this [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1940.8400000000001s)]
*  terrible war on Gaza, he wanted to [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1943.04s)]
*  weaken the power of the Supreme [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1945.44s)]
*  Court in Israel. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1947.48s)]
*  That led to mass protests. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1948.8400000000001s)]
*  And then you have the family [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1950.68s)]
*  members of the hostages who [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1951.96s)]
*  desperately want a ceasefire in [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1953.28s)]
*  order to get their family members [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1954.8400000000001s)]
*  back protesting in the streets [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1956.44s)]
*  along with their supporters. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1958.04s)]
*  And Netanyahu is sick of it. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1959.68s)]
*  And so he wants to squash these [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1961.24s)]
*  protests and these protesters in [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1963.24s)]
*  what has been referred to as [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1965.32s)]
*  the greatest democracy in the [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1967.04s)]
*  region. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1969.12s)]
*  So his depravity and [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1969.6399999999999s)]
*  corruption doesn't end there. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1970.92s)]
*  Here's what you need to know. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1972.8799999999999s)]
*  Last month, Netanyahu moved to [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1973.96s)]
*  fire a guy by the name of Ronan [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1976.44s)]
*  Barr, citing a lack of trust. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1978.84s)]
*  Now Barr would have been literally [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1981.6399999999999s)]
*  the first Shin Bet leader to ever [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1984.1599999999999s)]
*  be fired in Israel. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1986.72s)]
*  However, his dismissal was put on [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1988.3200000000002s)]
*  hold after the Israeli Supreme [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1990.6000000000001s)]
*  Court stepped in and [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1992.68s)]
*  blocked his firing. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1993.88s)]
*  And then yesterday, [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1995.8400000000001s)]
*  Barr published an affidavit [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1997.0s)]
*  alleging that Prime Minister [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=1998.44s)]
*  Netanyahu allegedly placed his own [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2000.04s)]
*  interests over the state of Israel, [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2002.04s)]
*  but Barr refused to help him do so. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2004.3600000000001s)]
*  So for example, on several [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2007.92s)]
*  occasions, Netanyahu wanted Barr to [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2009.6000000000001s)]
*  sign an opinion that would halt [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2012.04s)]
*  the Prime Minister's corruption [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2014.0s)]
*  trial. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2016.16s)]
*  And that's something that we've [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2017.0800000000002s)]
*  talked about a little bit on [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2018.3600000000001s)]
*  this show before. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2019.24s)]
*  I mean, one of the incentives that [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2019.76s)]
*  Netanyahu has had in continuing [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2021.88s)]
*  the bloodshed in Gaza and [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2023.8000000000002s)]
*  the West Bank is that as long as [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2025.28s)]
*  this war goes on, [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2027.0800000000002s)]
*  he's hoping that he can hold off on [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2028.2s)]
*  being prosecuted on these [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2030.3200000000002s)]
*  corruption charges. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2031.96s)]
*  And now we're learning he was [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2034.3200000000002s)]
*  trying to get the head of the Shin [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2035.5600000000002s)]
*  Bet to sign some opinion indicating [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2037.0800000000002s)]
*  that there's no reason that this [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2038.96s)]
*  corruption trial should move [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2040.88s)]
*  forward, it should be halted. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2042.6000000000001s)]
*  Netanyahu also told Barr that in [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2045.2s)]
*  the event of a constitutional [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2047.52s)]
*  crisis, Barr had to be loyal to [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2050.0s)]
*  him and not the court of law. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2052.52s)]
*  And finally, Netanyahu even [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2055.16s)]
*  instructed Barr to go after Israeli [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2057.4s)]
*  protesters. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2059.96s)]
*  So Barr said Netanyahu had told him [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2061.04s)]
*  on more than one occasion that he [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2063.08s)]
*  expected Shin Bet to take action [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2065.04s)]
*  against Israelis involved in [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2067.04s)]
*  anti-government demonstrations [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2069.04s)]
*  with a particular focus on [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2071.4s)]
*  financial backers. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2073.3199999999997s)]
*  Jake, that sounds real familiar. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2074.96s)]
*  We hear a lot about how Americans [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2078.04s)]
*  who protest against Israel's war [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2080.52s)]
*  on Gaza are funded by all sorts of [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2083.16s)]
*  nefarious figures and [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2085.52s)]
*  foreign governments and [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2087.0s)]
*  terrorist groups even though [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2088.68s)]
*  there's no evidence of that. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2090.72s)]
*  And now Netanyahu is using the same [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2092.8399999999997s)]
*  tactics against Israelis, [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2094.48s)]
*  his own people. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2096.04s)]
*  That's how depraved and corrupt and [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2096.9199999999996s)]
*  disgusting this man is. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2098.7599999999998s)]
*  And one of the charges against him [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2100.24s)]
*  is that his advisors might have [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2102.96s)]
*  taken money from the government of [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2105.48s)]
*  Qatar to do positive propaganda on [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2108.3599999999997s)]
*  behalf of Qatar within Israel. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2111.24s)]
*  And Shin Bet and Israelis are [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2113.72s)]
*  outraged by that idea. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2116.52s)]
*  Good, that's great. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2119.3199999999997s)]
*  I'm thrilled that they're outraged [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2122.12s)]
*  by that idea. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2124.24s)]
*  But it is deeply ironic that people [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2125.2s)]
*  in Israel are outraged that a [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2127.6s)]
*  foreign government would do [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2129.8799999999997s)]
*  propaganda in another country. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2131.44s)]
*  What are you guys doing over here? [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2133.3599999999997s)]
*  Are you, I mean, [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2136.16s)]
*  there's overwhelming Israeli [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2137.56s)]
*  propaganda here. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2139.7599999999998s)]
*  Who do we arrest to make that stop? [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2140.8799999999997s)]
*  But overall, look, [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2143.7999999999997s)]
*  this is the upside of Israel, [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2145.08s)]
*  is that they still have a thread [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2147.0s)]
*  bear democracy. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2148.92s)]
*  I mean, obviously, [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2150.3199999999997s)]
*  only for the Israelis, [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2151.52s)]
*  the Palestinians get a brutal [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2152.92s)]
*  dictatorship and some of the worst [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2154.56s)]
*  oppression in the world. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2156.52s)]
*  But within Israel, since, well, [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2158.72s)]
*  these fellow Israelis, these are [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2160.8s)]
*  important and special people, [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2162.7599999999998s)]
*  they actually care about their own [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2164.54s)]
*  rights and some parts of that [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2166.32s)]
*  system are healthy. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2167.84s)]
*  If they just ended the occupation [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2168.96s)]
*  and got rid of these brutal right [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2170.36s)]
*  wing terrorists that are currently [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2171.72s)]
*  running Israel, they could be [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2173.12s)]
*  a perfectly great nation, right? [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2174.36s)]
*  And because they have the [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2176.16s)]
*  foundations, like respecting [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2177.72s)]
*  the courts, a strong and healthy [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2179.68s)]
*  press, and an opposition that cares [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2181.68s)]
*  about protecting rights. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2183.84s)]
*  But if they give away their rights [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2185.56s)]
*  by the way, as happened in Turkey, [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2188.08s)]
*  and I think that Larry Treiber, [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2190.12s)]
*  Harvard Law professor talking about [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2192.0s)]
*  that and he mentioned, well, [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2194.12s)]
*  he was talking about here in [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2195.7599999999998s)]
*  America, but it also applies to [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2197.3199999999997s)]
*  Israel, as happened in Turkey, [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2199.12s)]
*  as happened in Germany. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2201.0s)]
*  So I hope that the Israeli people [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2202.3999999999996s)]
*  still have enough fight in them, [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2204.2s)]
*  at least when they're protecting [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2206.08s)]
*  their own interests, that they not [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2207.94s)]
*  give away their rights to this [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2209.8799999999997s)]
*  despotic madman Netanyahu. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2211.48s)]
*  Because his thirst for power isn't [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2213.52s)]
*  just to brutalize Palestinians and [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2215.88s)]
*  nearby Arabs and take their land. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2218.1600000000003s)]
*  His thirst for power also affects [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2221.0s)]
*  the citizens of Israel. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2222.8s)]
*  He's also going to take away your [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2224.28s)]
*  rights. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2225.6400000000003s)]
*  So if they don't push back now, [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2226.32s)]
*  they'll never be able to get rid of [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2228.04s)]
*  Netanyahu, and then we'll have this [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2229.88s)]
*  monstrous government for [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2231.96s)]
*  God knows how long. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2233.48s)]
*  But I've seen this movie many, [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2235.1600000000003s)]
*  many times, yes, including in [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2237.0s)]
*  Turkey and in Russia, where they [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2238.8s)]
*  slowly take away rights. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2240.6400000000003s)]
*  But there's a critical couple of [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2242.08s)]
*  crossing of the Rubicon moments. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2244.04s)]
*  And this is one of those moments. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2246.08s)]
*  If Netanyahu can fire the head of [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2247.48s)]
*  Shin Bet and end the investigations [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2249.6s)]
*  of corruption against himself, [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2252.0s)]
*  then that's it. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2254.28s)]
*  Even within Israel, [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2255.72s)]
*  democracy is lost. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2256.8s)]
*  Well, luckily, Netanyahu was unable [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2258.36s)]
*  to weaken the Israeli Supreme [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2260.72s)]
*  Court, but had he done so, [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2262.64s)]
*  there was some likelihood that [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2264.4s)]
*  the Supreme Court would not have [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2266.44s)]
*  been able to block Netanyahu's [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2268.64s)]
*  decision to try to oust Ronin Barr [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2270.72s)]
*  from his post. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2272.96s)]
*  And by the way, Barr says the [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2273.76s)]
*  following, I was required to [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2275.36s)]
*  provide details regarding the [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2276.94s)]
*  identities of Israeli citizens, [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2278.6400000000003s)]
*  protest activists, and was expected [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2280.6000000000004s)]
*  to monitor protest financiers. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2282.6800000000003s)]
*  And by the way, I mean, [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2285.48s)]
*  I just want to draw some parallels [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2286.88s)]
*  to the United States and [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2288.96s)]
*  bring up an argument I've been [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2290.4s)]
*  making quite a bit on the show [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2292.32s)]
*  lately as it pertains to due [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2294.2000000000003s)]
*  process. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2296.0400000000004s)]
*  When American citizens begin to [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2297.2400000000002s)]
*  advocate for the erosion of due [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2299.76s)]
*  process under this assumption that [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2302.36s)]
*  it's totally okay to do that [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2304.8s)]
*  because it's only going to impact [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2306.6800000000003s)]
*  non-citizens of this country, [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2308.76s)]
*  they're really harming themselves. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2310.78s)]
*  Because these same tactics will in [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2313.2000000000003s)]
*  fact be utilized against Americans [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2315.2400000000002s)]
*  as well, against citizens as well. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2317.36s)]
*  And so you're seeing the same [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2319.8s)]
*  behavior, the same attacks that [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2321.76s)]
*  Netanyahu has used to target [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2324.1600000000003s)]
*  protesters here in the United [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2325.96s)]
*  States. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2327.92s)]
*  Now he's using those same tactics [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2328.92s)]
*  against his own people in Israel. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2330.52s)]
*  So just something to keep in mind, [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2332.16s)]
*  when you start making excuses or [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2334.12s)]
*  engage in apologia for this type of [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2336.0s)]
*  disgusting anti-democratic behavior, [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2338.08s)]
*  you should expect that to boomerang [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2340.58s)]
*  right back to you. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2342.7799999999997s)]
*  Now Barr refused those requests, [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2344.7599999999998s)]
*  thankfully so, and that's the reason [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2346.68s)]
*  why Netanyahu wanted to oust him. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2348.92s)]
*  But the timing of Barr's firing is [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2350.96s)]
*  also a little suspicious. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2352.7599999999998s)]
*  For one, the Shin Bet had recently [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2354.12s)]
*  released that report listing how [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2356.12s)]
*  its own failures led to the events [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2358.0s)]
*  of October 7th. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2359.96s)]
*  And in that report, [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2361.16s)]
*  they also cite the mistakes made by [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2362.36s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu in the lead up [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2364.44s)]
*  to the October 7th attacks. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2366.6s)]
*  And what's even fishier is that [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2368.52s)]
*  the Shin Bet along with Israeli [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2370.36s)]
*  forces have been investigating and [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2372.2s)]
*  recently arrested two of [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2374.2s)]
*  Netanyahu's aides. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2375.72s)]
*  This is what you were referencing [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2377.12s)]
*  earlier, Cenk, in connection to [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2378.92s)]
*  improper payments with the country [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2380.7599999999998s)]
*  of Qatar. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2382.7599999999998s)]
*  And then an Israeli businessman [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2383.3199999999997s)]
*  recently told Israel's public [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2385.44s)]
*  broadcaster that he transferred [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2387.52s)]
*  money to the other Netanyahu aide [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2389.72s)]
*  Elie Feldstein on behalf of [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2392.08s)]
*  a US lobbyist working for Qatar. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2394.04s)]
*  Now Feldstein is also accused of [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2396.3999999999996s)]
*  leaking classified intelligence [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2398.52s)]
*  documents. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2400.72s)]
*  I mean, it's just a total mess, [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2401.48s)]
*  right? [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2403.16s)]
*  He's got his aides who are in [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2403.68s)]
*  trouble. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2405.2799999999997s)]
*  He doesn't like the fact that he's [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2405.8399999999997s)]
*  being criticized in this report [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2407.7599999999998s)]
*  that was put out by the Shin Bet. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2409.52s)]
*  And so his only tactic is let me [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2411.3999999999996s)]
*  retaliate and let me just get rid [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2413.3599999999997s)]
*  of my critics by sending him to [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2415.3999999999996s)]
*  the US government and [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2417.16s)]
*  my critics both when it comes to [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2418.6s)]
*  Israeli civilians, right? [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2421.1200000000003s)]
*  Let me squash those protesters, [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2423.52s)]
*  but also let me go after the head [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2425.56s)]
*  of the Shin Bet because he's not [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2427.48s)]
*  doing my bidding and [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2429.4s)]
*  I don't like that. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2430.6800000000003s)]
*  That's who Netanyahu is. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2432.0s)]
*  That's the kind of guy [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2433.84s)]
*  Netanyahu is. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2434.76s)]
*  Yeah, so a couple things here. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2436.28s)]
*  So Shin Bet are no angels and [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2438.04s)]
*  they along with the rest of [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2441.04s)]
*  the Israeli government are [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2443.56s)]
*  have Palestinian blood all over [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2446.3599999999997s)]
*  their hands and everywhere else. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2448.8799999999997s)]
*  So it's not like these guys are [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2451.8799999999997s)]
*  like some sort of peacenik liberals [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2454.16s)]
*  or anything along those lines. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2456.92s)]
*  No, they're due security for [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2459.44s)]
*  the state of Israel. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2461.44s)]
*  They can oftentimes are very, [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2463.0s)]
*  very ruthless. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2465.04s)]
*  And so they're not trying to [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2466.04s)]
*  protect anyone but Israelis. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2467.8399999999997s)]
*  And so if Israel goes, yeah, [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2469.8799999999997s)]
*  it's okay. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2472.16s)]
*  I've been there, [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2473.04s)]
*  I've been there, [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2474.04s)]
*  it's okay. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2475.04s)]
*  I bet this authoritarian leader has [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2475.64s)]
*  our best interest in mind. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2477.88s)]
*  That's a mistake a lot of folks [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2479.72s)]
*  have made throughout the country [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2481.24s)]
*  and throughout world history. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2482.8s)]
*  And so if they keep going in [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2484.52s)]
*  this direction, eventually Netanyahu [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2485.84s)]
*  will start treating the Israelis [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2487.72s)]
*  like they're Palestinians. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2489.52s)]
*  because he doesn't really care [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2491.56s)]

*  It's not like he's like, my God, [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2493.52s)]
*  other people are sacred, [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2495.48s)]
*  only Netanyahu is sacred. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2497.0s)]
*  And you can tell because he's [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2498.68s)]
*  systematically destroying not just [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2500.84s)]
*  Gaza, not just the brutal [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2503.88s)]
*  occupation of the West Bank, but [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2505.44s)]
*  he's systematically destroying his [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2507.56s)]
*  own democracy within Israel. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2509.8s)]
*  And that's how all these [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2511.8s)]
*  authoritarian leaders are. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2512.88s)]
*  It's so hard for the rest of us to [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2514.08s)]
*  grasp that these people were born [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2516.96s)]
*  with no empathy. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2519.88s)]
*  So that's why whether it's Trump, [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2522.2000000000003s)]
*  Putin, Netanyahu, Erdogan, [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2524.48s)]
*  you keep waiting for them to have [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2526.52s)]
*  a human moment and go, my God, [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2528.52s)]
*  that's a fellow Israeli, [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2530.44s)]
*  that's a fellow Turk, [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2531.96s)]
*  I really care about them. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2533.24s)]
*  No, they don't. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2534.52s)]
*  They only care about themselves. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2535.9199999999996s)]
*  They have no ability to empathize [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2537.3199999999997s)]
*  with anyone. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2538.8399999999997s)]
*  In fact, we're asking a poll in [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2539.4799999999996s)]
*  the live chat, check out the show [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2541.04s)]

*  And so we are asking, [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2546.3999999999996s)]
*  who's more authoritarian Trump or [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2548.2799999999997s)]
*  Netanyahu and last I checked it was [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2551.64s)]
*  50 50. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2555.0s)]
*  And look, it doesn't get worse than [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2555.8399999999997s)]
*  Netanyahu, so [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2558.7999999999997s)]
*  I guess I would vote Netanyahu. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2560.04s)]
*  Who's more corrupt? [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2562.8s)]
*  But then Trump is corrupted by [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2564.6000000000004s)]
*  Netanyahu, I don't know if that [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2566.36s)]
*  makes him more or [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2568.2400000000002s)]
*  less corrupt than Netanyahu. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2569.1200000000003s)]
*  So I think you guys are probably [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2570.5200000000004s)]
*  right to have it right around 50 50. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2571.6800000000003s)]

*  finally, an honest news outlet. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2625.36s)]

*  calls out all sides. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2629.44s)]

*  Well, we got to talk a little bit [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2638.56s)]
*  about what the priorities seem to [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2640.16s)]
*  be over at the National Institutes [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2641.88s)]
*  of Health. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2644.0s)]
*  Because you would think, given the [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2644.6800000000003s)]
*  title of the department, [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2646.6800000000003s)]
*  they would care about prioritizing [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2648.2400000000002s)]
*  the nation's health. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2650.28s)]
*  But it appears that no, [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2652.28s)]
*  they're prioritizing the feelings [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2653.44s)]
*  of a foreign government instead. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2655.1600000000003s)]
*  So let's give you the details on [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2656.88s)]
*  this story. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2658.1200000000003s)]
*  A new notice that's been put out [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2660.44s)]
*  by the National Institutes of [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2662.4s)]
*  Health makes clear that grants [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2664.32s)]
*  will not be awarded to any [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2666.28s)]
*  researchers who have decided to [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2668.0400000000004s)]
*  support or engage in the boycott [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2670.36s)]
*  of Israel. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2672.7999999999997s)]
*  And when I say boycott of Israel, [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2673.4s)]
*  it's the boycott and [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2675.6s)]
*  divestment movement that seeks to [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2677.12s)]
*  avoid spending any resources on [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2679.52s)]
*  businesses or business entities [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2681.7999999999997s)]
*  located in Israel. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2684.2799999999997s)]
*  And that's meant to basically [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2685.96s)]
*  implement some pressure to get [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2688.16s)]
*  Israel to maybe rethink some of [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2690.36s)]
*  their policies as it pertains to [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2692.56s)]
*  Palestinian civilians. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2694.7999999999997s)]
*  But nonetheless, we can't have [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2696.64s)]
*  that, so now the NIH is deciding [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2698.56s)]
*  to give grants to the families of [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2700.44s)]
*  the children, and it's deciding [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2702.44s)]
*  that it makes more sense to punish [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2704.2400000000002s)]
*  researchers for their political [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2706.08s)]
*  beliefs that of course are not in [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2708.08s)]
*  any way tied to medical research [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2709.96s)]
*  they might be doing. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2712.08s)]
*  So just think about it this way, [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2713.88s)]
*  if a researcher is supportive of [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2715.88s)]
*  the BDS movement, but is also [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2718.0s)]
*  doing important critical research [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2720.08s)]
*  on I don't know a cancer cure. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2722.28s)]
*  Well, that individual will be [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2724.36s)]
*  denied grants by the National [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2726.44s)]
*  Institutes of Health because of his [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2728.44s)]
*  political engagements with [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2730.88s)]
*  the BDS movement. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2732.6800000000003s)]
*  So this was a story that was [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2733.76s)]
*  brought to my attention at least [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2735.56s)]
*  from Glenn Greenwald over at X, [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2737.88s)]
*  where he posted a screenshot of [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2740.36s)]
*  the notice itself and what it said. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2742.8s)]
*  So this is the relevant part, [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2745.92s)]
*  it says recipients must comply [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2747.52s)]
*  with all applicable federal [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2749.36s)]
*  anti-discrimination laws material [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2751.0s)]
*  to the government's payment [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2753.2400000000002s)]
*  decisions. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2754.92s)]
*  And then it notes, okay, [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2755.84s)]
*  it lists different discriminatory [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2757.6400000000003s)]
*  acts. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2760.24s)]
*  And then in D it says, [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2761.08s)]
*  discriminatory prohibited boycott [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2762.64s)]
*  means refusing to deal, [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2765.4799999999996s)]
*  cutting commercial relations or [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=2767.3599999999997s)]

*  So what? [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3041.2s)]
*  What impact does that have on her [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3042.48s)]
*  ability to effectively teach [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3044.48s)]
*  within the public school system? [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3046.24s)]
*  It has no effect. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3048.08s)]
*  But she was punished, [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3049.08s)]
*  everyone was quiet about it, [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3050.3199999999997s)]
*  everyone cared. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3051.96s)]
*  And so now this brain rot has made [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3053.08s)]
*  its way to federal government [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3055.28s)]

*  suffer as a component of that. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3059.56s)]
*  Because we should be funding [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3061.92s)]
*  important research, especially as [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3063.6800000000003s)]
*  it pertains to cures for diseases, [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3066.08s)]

*  This is insane. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3069.4s)]
*  Yeah, so look, I've taken a decent [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3071.2000000000003s)]

*  But I was. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3077.64s)]
*  So we had an interview with him, [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3079.52s)]
*  we challenged him on the things we [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3080.8s)]

*  he was running. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3084.48s)]
*  I've talked a lot about his housing [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3085.4s)]

*  policies, which I like, etc. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3088.36s)]
*  So, and he is in his own way [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3090.1600000000003s)]
*  anti-establishment. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3093.1600000000003s)]

*  about vaccines and some of [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3099.5600000000004s)]
*  the other stuff that I have to [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3101.36s)]

*  damage on some fronts could [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3110.56s)]

*  Why? [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3126.16s)]
*  The First Amendment very clearly [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3126.7999999999997s)]

*  Israel nonsense? [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3133.88s)]
*  And so it's obviously deeply [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3136.24s)]
*  unconstitutional. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3138.04s)]
*  No decent American would be in [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3139.16s)]

*  Okay, but then you go to [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3142.52s)]
*  the next level. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3143.3599999999997s)]

*  a cover story. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3152.2799999999997s)]
*  We're so concerned about [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3153.52s)]
*  anti-Semitism. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3155.48s)]

*  Okay, but at least you can make [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3167.2799999999997s)]
*  some sort of argument there, right? [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3168.68s)]
*  I mean, barely, it's bare thread, [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3171.04s)]

*  But in this case, [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3174.68s)]
*  it isn't even about anti-Semitism, [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3175.3599999999997s)]
*  it's about contracts. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3176.7999999999997s)]

*  Wait, whether you want to spend [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3179.8799999999997s)]
*  money in Israel or you don't want [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3181.44s)]

*  Other than the fact that you're [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3186.44s)]

*  So which then leads me to, [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3193.64s)]
*  I have to say it because he's so [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3195.08s)]
*  over the top. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3196.7999999999997s)]

*  Is Bobby Kennedy Jr. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3200.44s)]

*  Yes, he is. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3203.04s)]

*  something with Epstein? [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3206.76s)]

*  the Epstein files. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3210.2000000000003s)]
*  That's because the president and [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3211.1200000000003s)]
*  the head of HHS are also on [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3212.8s)]

*  Yes. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3220.08s)]

*  Yes. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3221.6800000000003s)]
*  And now as head of Health and [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3223.08s)]
*  Human Services, he's weirdly, [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3224.6s)]
*  for no apparent reason, obsessed [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3226.7599999999998s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3236.56s)]
*  Well, look, he leaves us no choice [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3238.16s)]
*  but to wonder and [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3240.0s)]
*  to ask those questions. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3240.9199999999996s)]
*  because otherwise this makes no [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3243.04s)]

*  for it. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3246.56s)]
*  They're just like, that's it. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3247.04s)]

*  Glenn Greenwald shared this on X. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3257.48s)]

*  It's absurd. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3286.96s)]
*  All right, that doesn't- [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3288.6800000000003s)]
*  Hey, Ana, real quick, [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3289.92s)]
*  I'll just follow up on that. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3290.92s)]
*  So what's the cover story for [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3292.36s)]
*  the media? [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3295.1600000000003s)]
*  So because it's not like MSNBC- [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3296.2400000000002s)]
*  Cenk, they don't need a cover [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3299.1200000000003s)]
*  story. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3300.56s)]
*  Okay, we know what happens to [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3301.0800000000004s)]
*  people in the media if they're too [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3302.2000000000003s)]
*  critical of the Israeli government. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3303.52s)]
*  You've created a media company [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3305.32s)]
*  where no one has to worry about [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3306.88s)]
*  getting fired for [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3308.4s)]
*  sharing their opinion. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3309.2400000000002s)]
*  But that's not the case in [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3310.92s)]
*  the vast majority of news outlets. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3312.48s)]
*  Are you crazy? [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3314.4s)]
*  Are you insane? [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3315.2400000000002s)]
*  We know what would happen, [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3316.6s)]
*  come on. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3317.64s)]
*  Right, so just like for example, [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3318.16s)]
*  it's not like CNN, New York Times, [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3320.48s)]
*  Washington Post, MSNBC, [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3322.88s)]
*  don't have an opportunity or [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3325.0s)]
*  an inclination to criticize Trump. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3327.04s)]
*  They can't wait to criticize Trump. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3329.96s)]
*  Yet here, and [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3333.36s)]
*  Bobby Kennedy Jr, my God. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3334.48s)]
*  The amount of negative articles [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3337.96s)]
*  about Bobby Kennedy Jr that the New [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3339.48s)]
*  York Times has printed could fill [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3341.4s)]
*  an entire library. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3343.2000000000003s)]
*  But here, criticizing Israel, [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3344.36s)]
*  we cannot find a way to do it. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3346.92s)]
*  Golly gee, we just ran out of ink. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3349.84s)]
*  Time to go to a commercial break. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3352.76s)]
*  I guess we just can't find any [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3354.8s)]
*  criticism of Israel at all. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3356.36s)]
*  But all of you bow your heads and [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3357.96s)]
*  don't you dare ever criticize [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3359.96s)]
*  Israel. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3361.88s)]
*  You want to touch a dollar going to [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3362.84s)]
*  Israel? [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3364.36s)]
*  You are not allowed to do that, [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3365.12s)]
*  okay? [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3366.8s)]
*  You must spend all of your dollars [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3367.56s)]
*  on Israel, both through your taxes, [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3369.2000000000003s)]
*  they're going to take endless [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3371.12s)]
*  billions of dollars from you, and [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3372.56s)]
*  you must spend money there. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3374.2799999999997s)]
*  Otherwise, your health is in [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3375.8s)]
*  danger. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3377.8s)]
*  Yeah, I know, I know, brother. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3378.68s)]
*  But okay, go ahead mainstream media, [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3380.4s)]

*  Why aren't you talking about this [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3384.48s)]
*  obvious takeover? [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3385.96s)]
*  Yeah, all right, in the second [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3387.92s)]
*  hour, we'll talk a little bit about [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3389.36s)]
*  Senator Peter Welch. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3391.12s)]
*  He did visit a Palestinian activist [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3392.64s)]
*  who is in detention for wanting an [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3395.48s)]
*  end to the bloodshed in the Middle [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3398.96s)]
*  East. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3400.88s)]
*  And then later in the show, [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3401.4s)]
*  we'll switch things up a little bit [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3402.84s)]
*  and talk about the Ivy Leagues that [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3404.64s)]
*  have been targeted by Donald Trump. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3406.44s)]
*  One of those Ivy Leagues is [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3408.52s)]
*  actually fighting back pretty [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3409.64s)]
*  aggressively. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuySH7MpLzw&t=3411.0s)]
