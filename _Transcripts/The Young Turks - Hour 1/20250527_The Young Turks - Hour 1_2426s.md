TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.
The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.
On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.
Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.
Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.
TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.
TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.
TYT‚Äôs 24/7 programming is available on YouTube TV, Samsung TV, Plus, Roku, Xumo, TCLtv+, Fubo, and more.

*  Why win one time and lose another time? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=0.0s)]
*  What was the difference maker in [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  the same district? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=4.7s)]
*  And do people ever brawl there or [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=5.54s)]
*  is this super polite? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=7.34s)]
*  No, I'm serious because they're [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=8.84s)]
*  progressives and more conservative [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=10.68s)]
*  members really disagree on a bunch [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=12.72s)]
*  of things. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=14.52s)]
*  I mean, I think they do. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=15.08s)]
*  They say that they do publicly. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=16.12s)]
*  So do they disagree internally? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=18.6s)]
*  Tell me what you think is the right [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=20.32s)]
*  direction for the Democratic Party. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=21.76s)]
*  People come at me with issues. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  I'm going to tell them, okay, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=24.52s)]
*  I hear you, but [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=26.0s)]
*  here's what I think on the issue. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=26.8s)]
*  If they don't, especially if it is [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=28.52s)]
*  different, and I'm going to vote [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=30.439999999999998s)]
*  the way that I feel that I need to [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=32.24s)]
*  vote, right? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=33.84s)]
*  And the way that I feel that the [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=34.56s)]
*  people in the district that elected [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=35.96s)]
*  me want me to vote. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  A lot of those diversity issues [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=38.4s)]
*  that we were implementing were [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=39.92s)]
*  signed into law by Donald Trump. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=41.36s)]
*  All right, welcome back to [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=43.08s)]
*  The Young Turks. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=43.72s)]
*  We're doing some interesting [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=44.519999999999996s)]
*  interviews here in the 8 o'clock [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=46.0s)]
*  hour going forward. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  So join me today in studio is [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=48.8s)]
*  representative Gil Cisneros. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=50.28s)]
*  Congressman, thank you for [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=52.96s)]
*  joining us, appreciate it. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=53.68s)]
*  No, thank you for having me. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=54.760000000000005s)]
*  All right, so [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=56.2s)]
*  the congressman is from the 31st [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=56.760000000000005s)]
*  district of California. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=58.28s)]
*  He's a Democrat. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=59.36s)]
*  He even has a podcast I was on [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=60.56s)]
*  called Who Dem? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=62.08s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=63.04s)]
*  Which is kind of a fun podcast. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=63.54s)]
*  It feels like a representative from [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=65.2s)]
*  Louisiana should have that podcast. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=67.2s)]
*  Or maybe Cincinnati, but still. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=69.4s)]
*  Okay, so what I want to do is first, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=72.24000000000001s)]
*  I want to get to know you, okay? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=73.96000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=75.64s)]
*  And then I want to talk about what [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=76.16s)]
*  the Democrats are going to do in [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=77.48s)]
*  Congress and what they're doing to [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=78.76s)]
*  oppose Trump. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=80.16s)]
*  So where did you grow up? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=81.16s)]
*  Grew up here in Southern [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=83.36s)]
*  California, a city called Torrance. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=84.4s)]
*  It's where I was born, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=86.88s)]
*  it was where I was raised. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=87.84s)]
*  Went to high school there. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=88.88s)]
*  Left as soon as five days after [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=91.12s)]
*  I graduated from high school, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=92.88s)]
*  went off and joined the Navy. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=94.47999999999999s)]
*  And I was off to boot camp and [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=96.08s)]
*  never kind of really went back [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=97.88s)]
*  there since, right? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=100.03999999999999s)]
*  But Southern California is my roots. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=101.92s)]
*  It's where my family still is here. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=103.88s)]
*  It's where me and my wife have [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=107.2s)]
*  settled and it is home. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=109.03999999999999s)]
*  What did your parents do? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=111.2s)]
*  My dad was a Vietnam veteran. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=113.16s)]
*  He kind of worked for a company for [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=116.96000000000001s)]
*  it was Reynolds Metal, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=119.32000000000001s)]
*  they made aluminum cans. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  He did that for a long time, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=122.36s)]
*  over 20 plus years. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=124.32000000000001s)]
*  And then one day, they just kind of [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=126.44000000000001s)]
*  said, you know what, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=128.32s)]
*  we don't need you anymore. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=129.32s)]
*  So then he kind of just tried to [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=131.08s)]
*  get back and [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=133.24s)]
*  kind of did a lot of things. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=134.04000000000002s)]
*  He actually kind of got into TV in [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=135.76s)]
*  a little bit, like he worked for [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=138.32s)]
*  directing shows on a home, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=140.96s)]
*  like a shopping network. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=143.28s)]
*  And then like a little small, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=145.28s)]
*  like little, I mean, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=146.95999999999998s)]
*  it wasn't huge or anything, but [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=148.11999999999998s)]
*  they sold jewelry and [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=149.89999999999998s)]
*  things like that. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=151.11999999999998s)]
*  And he kind of did that for [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=152.32s)]
*  a little while too. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=153.44s)]
*  Maybe it was an Alcoa fantastic [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=154.64s)]
*  finish after all. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=156.67999999999998s)]
*  Okay, so your dad's basically [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=157.92s)]
*  a blue collar guy, right? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=160.44s)]
*  And so you guys are California, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=163.07999999999998s)]
*  right? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=165.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=165.88s)]
*  For a lot of folks don't know what [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=166.79999999999998s)]
*  that means. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=167.95999999999998s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=168.48s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=169.44s)]
*  Actually, from California, right? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=169.95999999999998s)]
*  Our family was from here, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=172.72s)]
*  this is where our roots are. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=174.64000000000001s)]
*  People say like, well, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=176.4s)]
*  we used to always get asked, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=178.08s)]
*  like, well, when did your family [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=179.96s)]
*  move to California? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=182.04000000000002s)]
*  And my family's always been [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=183.24s)]
*  in California. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=184.84s)]
*  We didn't come here, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=185.92000000000002s)]
*  the United States came to us. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=187.52s)]
*  Okay, so your family was here [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=190.84s)]
*  before California became a state. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=192.24s)]
*  Mm-hm. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=193.64000000000001s)]
*  Okay, that's kind of badass. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=194.4s)]
*  It feels a little yellowstone. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=195.56s)]
*  Okay, so that's neat. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=197.0s)]
*  Okay, so what did you do for [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=200.04000000000002s)]
*  a living after the Navy? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=201.56s)]
*  So I went and [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=203.4s)]
*  worked at Frito-Lay for a little [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=204.4s)]
*  bit. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=206.84s)]
*  CEO, CFO, what do we do? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=207.76000000000002s)]
*  I was a manager, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=210.08s)]
*  I kind of ran different shifts, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=211.52s)]
*  right? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=214.16000000000003s)]
*  So I was first in the shipping, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=214.72000000000003s)]
*  ran the third shift in the warehouse [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=216.72000000000003s)]
*  and shipping and distribution. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=219.0s)]
*  Then after doing that for [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=221.04000000000002s)]
*  about three years, I moved over to [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=222.4s)]
*  the manufacturing side and [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=224.20000000000002s)]
*  pretty much ran the Funions and [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=225.84s)]
*  Munchies team there on the first [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=227.76000000000002s)]
*  shift there for a little while. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=229.88000000000002s)]
*  So kind of basically right there, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=232.04s)]
*  I had a team of people that kind of [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=234.52s)]
*  worked and made the product. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=236.84s)]
*  But I always say my connection to [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=238.8s)]
*  people, right, is I stood the [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=241.72s)]
*  mid-watch on the ship and [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=244.64s)]
*  then I worked the night shift as [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=247.0s)]
*  well at Frito-Lay. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=250.12s)]
*  So yeah, I've kind of done those [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=252.48s)]
*  things and I think we should [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=254.92000000000002s)]
*  connect, right? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=257.2s)]
*  I had real jobs, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=258.88s)]
*  done real things that people do [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=259.72s)]
*  so it's my connection to people I [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=262.24s)]
*  think and people really kind of I [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=263.84000000000003s)]
*  think that's what helped me connect [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=265.28000000000003s)]
*  with them. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=266.68s)]
*  Yeah, that makes sense because you [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=267.20000000000005s)]
*  had real jobs, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=269.0s)]
*  you're a real American. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=269.72s)]
*  And although I am looking forward [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=271.04s)]
*  to the Funion caucus in Congress. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=273.16s)]
*  A little bit of mix of fun and [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=275.52000000000004s)]
*  onion, maybe it's a little [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=278.8s)]
*  satirical, plus you get to hand [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=282.0s)]
*  out the snacks, fun for everyone. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=285.0s)]
*  Munchies caucus could also work, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=288.36s)]
*  but okay, so that's great. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=291.15999999999997s)]
*  That's an all American story. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=293.2s)]
*  So then wait a minute, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=294.52s)]
*  what happened? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=295.56s)]
*  How'd you get here? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=296.32s)]
*  I left Frito-Lay, making chips was [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=298.2s)]
*  not something that I think I wanted [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=300.88s)]
*  to continue to do with my life. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=303.47999999999996s)]
*  And I did kind of, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=305.88s)]
*  I got out of the Navy, right? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=306.76s)]
*  And I did feel like there was a [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=308.24s)]
*  void as far as like serving and [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=309.96s)]
*  really kind of contributing. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=311.91999999999996s)]
*  And so I was looking to do what was [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=314.71999999999997s)]
*  going to come next and then just [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=317.08s)]
*  Happened to go get dinner one day [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=320.4s)]
*  at an Allen L barbecue and saw they [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=322.28s)]
*  had a lottery machine and said, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=324.4s)]
*  well, along with my chicken dinner, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=326.35999999999996s)]
*  why don't you give me 10 lottery [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=328.44s)]
*  tickets too and believe it or [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=330.15999999999997s)]
*  not, I actually won. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=331.79999999999995s)]
*  So- [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=334.0s)]
*  How you like them apples? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=334.59999999999997s)]
*  You like barbecue? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=335.88s)]
*  How you like that kind of barbecue? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=337.24s)]
*  Yeah, so it was a life changing [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=338.96s)]
*  experience that allowed my wife and [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=341.0s)]
*  I to start our foundation that we [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=343.47999999999996s)]
*  put money into a big portion of our [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=345.71999999999997s)]
*  winnings in there and we started [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=348.04s)]
*  focusing on educational issues [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=350.04s)]
*  around college access programs, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=352.12s)]
*  college scholarships, other things. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=354.32s)]
*  But the thing that I saw that at [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=356.6s)]
*  that time we were living in [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=358.12s)]
*  Pequo Rivera, California. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=359.2s)]
*  And I was seeing a lot of the kids [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=361.6s)]
*  that were trying to go wanted to do [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=364.0s)]
*  more, right? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=366.48s)]
*  They wanted to go to college, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=367.76s)]
*  they wanted to make more of [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=369.04s)]
*  themselves, but they didn't really [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=370.2s)]
*  know how to do it. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=371.84s)]
*  And they faced a lot of the same [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=373.4s)]
*  obstacles or challenges that I [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=375.44s)]
*  faced when I was coming to write. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=377.6s)]
*  There was nobody in my family at [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=378.92s)]
*  the college, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=379.96000000000004s)]
*  there was nobody to ask. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=380.48s)]
*  And a lot of these kids had that [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=382.20000000000005s)]
*  same issue. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=383.40000000000003s)]
*  And so we tried to really kind of [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=384.04s)]
*  focus and really kind of help them [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=385.48s)]
*  navigate the process because a lot [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=387.20000000000005s)]
*  of them didn't know how to do that. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=388.88s)]
*  So what was the name of [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=391.64000000000004s)]
*  the restaurant again? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=392.32000000000005s)]
*  L and L Hawaiian barbecue. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=393.36s)]
*  And a Hawaiian barbecue and [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=396.08000000000004s)]
*  they're selling lottery tickets. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=397.28000000000003s)]
*  What were the chances? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=398.76000000000005s)]
*  And boom, you hit the double [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=400.32000000000005s)]
*  rainbow. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=401.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=401.92s)]
*  Okay, so- [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=402.44s)]
*  And it was not a little winnings. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=403.08000000000004s)]
*  It wasn't like sometimes it was [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=405.84000000000003s)]
*  a scratch off, nice, 5000, nice. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=407.08s)]
*  Right, no, I won one of those. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=409.24s)]
*  No, it was life changing. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=410.47999999999996s)]
*  It was, we took the lump sum, but [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=412.12s)]
*  the winning was $266 million. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=415.44s)]
*  Geez him Lord mercy. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=419.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=420.24s)]
*  Okay, God bless, man. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=420.76s)]
*  So, but look, you immediately do [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=422.96s)]
*  philanthropy after that. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=424.76s)]
*  That's beautiful, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=426.08s)]
*  helping other people come up. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=427.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=428.47999999999996s)]
*  So you would want someone like you [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=429.0s)]
*  to win a lottery, right? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=430.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=431.76s)]
*  It's the guy who's like, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=432.28s)]
*  Ferrari woohoo. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=433.76s)]
*  Wait, wait, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=434.91999999999996s)]
*  did you get a Ferrari? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=435.44s)]
*  No, I had the same truck for [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=437.32s)]
*  14 years. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=439.2s)]
*  I did get a new car. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=439.91999999999996s)]
*  I got a Denali was their first. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=441.15999999999997s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=443.88s)]
*  That's no big deal. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=444.88s)]
*  Okay, so in fact, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=446.52s)]
*  that makes it feel more all [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=447.8s)]
*  Americans who got a Denali, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=449.56s)]
*  got a big truck. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=451.47999999999996s)]
*  Your nickname is going to be [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=452.71999999999997s)]
*  Yellowstone soon. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=454.56s)]
*  Okay, so random. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=456.0s)]
*  Anyway, so all right, so [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=458.56s)]
*  that's an amazing story. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=459.79999999999995s)]
*  Usually the lottery guys though, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=461.56s)]
*  eventually spend it all, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=463.32s)]
*  become super depressed and stuff. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=464.59999999999997s)]
*  Did any of that happen? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=467.08s)]
*  Most winners, right, go through, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=469.2s)]
*  I think it's like five to seven [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=471.24s)]
*  years between they go through all [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=473.0s)]
*  their winnings and they've kind of [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=474.91999999999996s)]
*  lost everything. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=476.88s)]
*  Look, this is why I thank God for [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=478.12s)]
*  my education and that's when I [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=480.4s)]
*  really say I really won the lottery. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=482.44s)]
*  Because I think it's kind of [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=484.91999999999996s)]
*  allowed us to take an educational [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=486.64s)]
*  approach about how we do this and [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=488.64s)]
*  make sure that we do everything [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=490.71999999999997s)]
*  with a purpose and try to be, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=492.79999999999995s)]
*  I don't want to say frugal, but [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=494.88s)]
*  we don't overextend ourselves or [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=497.0s)]
*  do more than we can, right? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=499.32s)]
*  And we are careful with our [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=501.32s)]
*  winnings and make sure that we [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=502.84s)]
*  don't take risky chances with it. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=504.48s)]
*  And that's allowed us to kind of [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=506.4s)]
*  be able to kind of do that and [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=509.08s)]
*  kind of continue to live, right? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=511.42s)]
*  Live to enjoy the fruits of our [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=514.48s)]
*  labor as we should say, but [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=516.56s)]
*  the labor was the lottery. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=518.32s)]
*  So man, that is just the best meal [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=520.12s)]
*  you ever got. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=522.36s)]
*  I am stuck on the fact that it was [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=523.36s)]
*  at a restaurant. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=525.16s)]
*  Anyways, I'm going to get to [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=526.5600000000001s)]
*  politics in a second, but [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=527.5600000000001s)]
*  you got kids? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=528.5200000000001s)]
*  I do, I have twin boys, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=529.48s)]
*  11 years old. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=530.5200000000001s)]
*  Christopher Alexander, yeah. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=531.8000000000001s)]
*  Okay, yeah. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=533.6800000000001s)]
*  So, are you worried about them [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=534.7600000000001s)]
*  getting spoiled because the money [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=537.72s)]
*  now, are you guys super careful [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=540.5600000000001s)]
*  about that? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=543.0s)]
*  We just told them last year. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=543.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that makes sense because you [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=546.44s)]
*  wouldn't tell them three year old [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=548.0400000000001s)]
*  and seven year old. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=549.6400000000001s)]
*  Right, and it was something that [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=550.44s)]
*  they were starting to hear from [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=552.2s)]
*  their friends, right? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=553.72s)]
*  Because now everybody can get on [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=555.04s)]
*  Google and they're at that age now [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=556.44s)]
*  where they can look things up and [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=557.96s)]
*  see things and- [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=559.44s)]
*  Believe me, I know. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=560.2s)]
*  Yeah, and so we just kind of [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=561.52s)]
*  really shared the story with them. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=563.36s)]
*  But they're good kids, right? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=565.32s)]
*  And they are actually kind of, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=567.72s)]
*  I will say, cautious of that too, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=569.44s)]
*  right? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=571.4s)]
*  And I think we brought them up [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=571.92s)]
*  the same way. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=573.6s)]
*  They don't, they save their money. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=574.28s)]
*  They don't assume they're going to [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=577.4s)]
*  get anything. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=579.2s)]
*  Believe it or not, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=580.72s)]
*  they actually like to fly coach. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=581.84s)]
*  And kind of- [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=584.4000000000001s)]
*  That is hard to believe. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=585.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=586.0400000000001s)]
*  Because if I won the lottery, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=586.5600000000001s)]
*  the very first thing I would do is [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=587.72s)]
*  never fly coach again. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=589.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=590.12s)]
*  Because I've flown coach way too [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=590.6400000000001s)]
*  many times in my life. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=592.4000000000001s)]
*  No, no. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=593.6400000000001s)]
*  I got the battle scars. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=594.2s)]
*  Yeah, but they take that stuff into [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=595.32s)]
*  consideration and they do it, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=597.36s)]
*  right? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=599.0400000000001s)]
*  And so we're very proud of how [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=599.5600000000001s)]
*  they approach to it, right? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=601.24s)]
*  And they don't kind of make like, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=603.72s)]
*  yeah, we won the lottery. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=605.44s)]
*  And it's like, great. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=606.6800000000001s)]
*  So no, they're not like that at [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=607.44s)]
*  all. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=608.8800000000001s)]
*  All right, that's awesome, okay. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=609.48s)]
*  Can I ask you how old are you? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=611.2s)]
*  I am 54. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=612.6800000000001s)]
*  So you got started late, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=614.4399999999999s)]
*  like I did. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=615.5999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, with kids? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=616.52s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=617.48s)]
*  Did you get started after the [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=618.52s)]
*  lottery or before the lottery? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=619.68s)]
*  It was after. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=621.1999999999999s)]
*  So we even then that- [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=622.4s)]
*  Were you like, that's it, man. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=623.68s)]
*  We're making kids. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=624.8s)]
*  We got enough money. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=625.64s)]
*  Well, it was a process for us, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=626.4399999999999s)]
*  right? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=629.88s)]
*  We needed, I'm not ashamed to kind [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=630.52s)]
*  of say it, right? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=632.64s)]
*  But we needed science to kind of [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=633.76s)]
*  help us out, right? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=635.0799999999999s)]
*  So- [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=635.9599999999999s)]
*  God bless science. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=636.9599999999999s)]
*  I think we had the boys about four [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=637.8399999999999s)]
*  years after everything that after [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=642.32s)]
*  the lottery had happened. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=644.7600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, okay, that makes sense. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=646.6800000000001s)]
*  You were trying all along. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=648.2800000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=649.4000000000001s)]
*  Right, okay, yeah. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=649.9200000000001s)]
*  Okay, so now what pops into your [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=651.32s)]
*  head to run for Congress at that [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=653.1600000000001s)]
*  point? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=654.84s)]
*  Because look, at that point, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=655.36s)]
*  you already won the lottery. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=656.5600000000001s)]
*  I mean, you could spend the rest of [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=657.44s)]
*  your life in Bahamas, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=659.0400000000001s)]
*  help some kids, etc. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=660.0400000000001s)]
*  But you don't have to do anything. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=661.32s)]
*  I think it was 2016. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=663.5600000000001s)]
*  I think a lot of people after [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=666.0s)]
*  the election this time around are [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=668.12s)]
*  kind of angry and they want change. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=670.64s)]
*  And in 2016, I was the same way. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=673.24s)]
*  I was like, how did this happen? [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=676.56s)]
*  How did we let this guy get elected? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=677.72s)]
*  What are Democrats doing wrong? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=679.92s)]
*  What more could I do? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=682.52s)]
*  And the more I became, well, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=684.3199999999999s)]
*  maybe I can run for Congress. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=686.36s)]
*  Maybe I can get involved. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=689.4s)]
*  And when I say the lottery was [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=690.48s)]
*  life changing, right? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=692.96s)]
*  It changed things in many different [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=696.08s)]
*  ways and we started to get involved [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=698.12s)]
*  in politics more, right? [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=700.04s)]
*  Had the opportunity to do that, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=701.64s)]
*  to meet more members of Congress and [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=703.64s)]
*  what they were doing and kind of [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=705.8399999999999s)]
*  built some relationships that way [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=707.92s)]
*  and friendships through that. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=710.0799999999999s)]
*  And so I kind of talked to a couple [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=712.0799999999999s)]
*  of them and picked their brain and [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=713.92s)]
*  kind of thought, well, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=715.76s)]
*  what do you think about me running? [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=717.1999999999999s)]
*  And so a couple of them were, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=719.36s)]
*  some asked why, are you sure you [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=721.76s)]
*  really want to do this? [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=724.48s)]
*  And some were like, yeah, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=726.48s)]
*  we think you'd be good, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=728.48s)]
*  we could use you. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=730.5600000000001s)]
*  And so that's kind of what led me [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=732.0400000000001s)]
*  to run there in 2016 for [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=734.24s)]
*  the first time. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=735.72s)]
*  I mean, that was in 2016, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=736.8800000000001s)]
*  after 2016 election. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=738.6800000000001s)]
*  I ran in 2018, the first time [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=740.44s)]
*  around, it did not win my re-election [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=742.6400000000001s)]
*  in 2020, we flipped the red, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=745.6400000000001s)]
*  the blue seat there that covered [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=747.84s)]
*  parts of Orange, LA and [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=750.2s)]
*  San Bernardino County. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=751.86s)]
*  But I ran again here four years [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=753.72s)]
*  later after spinning four years in [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=755.48s)]
*  the administration at the Department [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=758.3199999999999s)]
*  of Defense as an undersecretary [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=760.3199999999999s)]
*  of defense, and then decided to [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=762.04s)]
*  leave there so I could run again in [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=763.8399999999999s)]
*  2024. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=765.5999999999999s)]
*  Okay, so I'm going to get back to [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=766.56s)]
*  that timeline in a sec, but [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=768.16s)]
*  keeping it real, without the money, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=769.64s)]
*  you couldn't have run, right? [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=772.1999999999999s)]
*  You could have, but it helped, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=774.3599999999999s)]
*  right? [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=776.9599999999999s)]
*  It definitely helped. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=777.56s)]
*  A lot of it was self-funded. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=779.64s)]
*  When we ran the first time, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=782.0s)]
*  it actually became a lot more [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=783.88s)]
*  expensive than the first time. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=785.88s)]
*  It actually became one of the most [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=788.28s)]
*  expensive races. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=790.08s)]
*  Actually, I think it probably [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=791.2s)]
*  still is probably the most expensive [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=792.72s)]
*  congressional race that there ever [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=794.6s)]
*  was in 2018. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=796.4s)]
*  Wow. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=797.12s)]
*  So let me get this right, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=797.62s)]
*  you lost in 2016. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=799.16s)]
*  No, no, 2016 was when I made [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=800.4s)]
*  the decision I could do more. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=801.92s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=803.68s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=805.08s)]
*  So you win the first election in [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=805.88s)]
*  2018, right? [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=807.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=808.0s)]
*  So then you get unseated in 2020 [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=809.0s)]
*  because it's a tough purple [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=810.88s)]
*  district, right? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=812.6s)]
*  Red to purple kind of district, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=814.1600000000001s)]
*  right? [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=816.24s)]
*  Then is this redistricting in 2020? [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=817.0s)]
*  Yes, so [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=820.6s)]
*  2022 became the new district lines. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=821.2s)]
*  Right, so then you run again in- [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=823.96s)]
*  24. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=825.9200000000001s)]
*  In 24, and you won again, so [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=826.5600000000001s)]
*  now this is your second time around [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=828.2s)]
*  in conference, right? [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=830.0s)]
*  And in between, did you always know [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=831.64s)]
*  you wanted to run again, or- [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=833.8000000000001s)]
*  I did not think I would run again. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=835.6800000000001s)]
*  I was actually happy at the Pentagon [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=839.2800000000001s)]
*  doing what I was doing. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=841.6s)]
*  And I had thought I would finish [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=842.72s)]
*  that up, I would do the 24, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=844.84s)]
*  after the 24 election, then we'll [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=846.88s)]
*  kind of see what happens next. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=849.5600000000001s)]
*  But some people approached me, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=852.6s)]
*  Grayson Pauletano was going to [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=854.6s)]
*  retire, and so they said, hey, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=856.76s)]
*  we think you should run again if [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=859.0s)]
*  you're thinking about it. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=860.84s)]
*  And I actually was like, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=862.52s)]
*  actually I'm not thinking about it. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=863.76s)]
*  But I think they kind of planted [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=865.6s)]
*  the seed and people again encouraged [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=867.32s)]
*  me and said, you should do this. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=869.48s)]
*  And I did, so I left my job at [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=871.16s)]
*  the Pentagon so I could go and [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=873.36s)]
*  run again and was able to win this [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=875.56s)]
*  time around. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=878.12s)]
*  So that means you've both won and [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=879.3199999999999s)]
*  lost in a purple district, right? [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=881.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=883.4s)]
*  One lost one, right? [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=883.92s)]
*  Yeah, this district is a lot [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=884.88s)]
*  bluer now. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=886.16s)]
*  This one's more blue. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=887.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=888.12s)]
*  Okay, so but you did win and [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=888.64s)]
*  lose in a purple district. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=890.04s)]
*  So were you able to ascertain why [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=891.36s)]
*  win one time and lose another time? [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=894.0799999999999s)]
*  What was the difference maker in [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=899.0s)]
*  the same district? [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=900.24s)]
*  I kind of thought about that for [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=902.72s)]
*  I haven't thought about it actually [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=904.96s)]
*  for a long time but [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=907.2s)]
*  I think there were things, right? [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=908.12s)]
*  And I told people, look, [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=912.16s)]
*  I am who I am. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=913.76s)]
*  This is what I stand for and [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=915.28s)]
*  you can either like me or [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=917.28s)]
*  choose not to support me again, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=919.2s)]
*  right? [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=921.8s)]
*  And I think a lot of people did [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=922.32s)]
*  support me, did, right? [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=924.12s)]
*  But I came out for the impeachment, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=925.92s)]
*  which I did not think helped me in [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=928.8000000000001s)]
*  my district. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=931.36s)]
*  And there was one guy who actually [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=934.48s)]
*  said, God, he thanked me for [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=937.44s)]
*  helping me out with his VA issues. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=940.08s)]
*  And it was like, I just wish you [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=944.2s)]
*  were a Republican so [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=945.6s)]
*  I could vote for you. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=946.5200000000001s)]
*  Now that person just already made [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=948.0400000000001s)]
*  up his mind that he was just going [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=949.5600000000001s)]
*  to vote Republican. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=950.96s)]
*  And we were kind of worried and [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=952.4000000000001s)]
*  we talked about this, right? [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=953.9200000000001s)]
*  It's that in that district, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=955.32s)]
*  people were tired of Trump, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=957.64s)]
*  they wanted to get rid of him. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=959.28s)]
*  But there was almost kind of like, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=960.9599999999999s)]
*  but we want to keep the check in [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=963.36s)]
*  place and so Biden did win [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=965.52s)]
*  the district in 20, but [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=967.88s)]
*  I lost the seat there. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=970.3199999999999s)]
*  So I lost by less, but [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=973.16s)]
*  it was about 1% that we lost by. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=975.16s)]
*  So do you think- [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=981.68s)]
*  A lot of people are voting for [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=983.04s)]
*  Biden, but [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=984.76s)]
*  they also made the decision to [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=985.52s)]
*  vote Democrat here. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=987.32s)]
*  Yeah, split the ticket. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=988.72s)]
*  Yeah, I get it. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=990.64s)]
*  So I'm going to get to current day [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=991.64s)]
*  in one second, but [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=993.6s)]
*  last thing on that. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=994.72s)]
*  In your experience now having run [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=996.08s)]
*  a bunch of times in one and [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=998.36s)]
*  lost, like I said, do you think [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=999.96s)]
*  it's more local issues or do you [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1002.08s)]
*  think it's more national issues [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1004.04s)]
*  that make the difference? [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1005.96s)]
*  Like national tide versus, no, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1007.64s)]
*  what's happening in the district? [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1010.28s)]
*  To me, I think it's a mixture of [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1013.1600000000001s)]
*  both, right? [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1015.0s)]
*  I think what's going on in [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1015.84s)]
*  the district is important and [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1017.52s)]
*  I really try to keep my focus on [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1019.4000000000001s)]
*  there and that does help there. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1021.24s)]
*  But I think there are times where [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1023.24s)]
*  national issues do kind of take [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1025.64s)]
*  over and when things are really [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1027.92s)]
*  going on and it's like the headlines [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1030.04s)]
*  or something big is going on, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1032.52s)]
*  that really kind of influences, [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1034.76s)]
*  I think people's decisions on how [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1036.94s)]
*  they vote, right? [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1039.04s)]
*  But I think economically, [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1040.16s)]
*  economics always play a big role, [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1042.6s)]
*  right? [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1044.6399999999999s)]
*  And I think right now when you [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1045.1599999999999s)]
*  kind of think of 2020, [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1046.84s)]
*  the economy was not doing so [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1048.1599999999999s)]
*  good under Trump and [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1049.76s)]
*  we're just going to vote out [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1050.8799999999999s)]
*  whoever's in office there, right? [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1052.52s)]
*  And that probably kind of that was [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1054.6399999999999s)]
*  a factor too as well. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1056.4799999999998s)]
*  And probably in 2018 to keep [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1057.84s)]
*  a check on Trump, right? [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1059.4399999999998s)]
*  So in that particular district. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1061.0s)]
*  So that's interesting. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1063.84s)]
*  Okay, now let's go to today. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1064.4799999999998s)]
*  So your Democrats are in [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1066.08s)]
*  the minority, huge conversations [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1067.52s)]
*  about, well, what should we do? [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1069.6s)]
*  We've lost our way, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1071.68s)]
*  the polling is at 27% for [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1072.8s)]
*  the Democratic Party hasn't been [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1074.16s)]
*  that low in polling history. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1076.08s)]
*  So first, are there conversations [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1078.76s)]
*  internally in the caucus, [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1081.0s)]
*  like all the time, some of the time, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1082.72s)]
*  no time where you guys get together [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1084.8799999999999s)]
*  and go, all right, [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1086.8s)]
*  who's got strategy? [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1087.92s)]
*  What do you think, plan A, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1089.16s)]
*  plan B, etc or no? [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1090.36s)]
*  I mean, there's conversations out [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1091.36s)]
*  there and there are things where [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1092.96s)]
*  people are getting there and [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1094.36s)]
*  we are trying to connect with [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1095.6399999999999s)]
*  people, right? [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1096.92s)]
*  But everybody has to kind of manage [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1097.48s)]
*  their own district in the sense too, [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1099.16s)]
*  right? [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1100.92s)]
*  Because what goes in a blue [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1101.42s)]
*  district is not going to go the [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1103.44s)]
*  same, a blue district in New York [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1105.68s)]
*  is not going to be the same as [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1108.1200000000001s)]
*  a blue district in Texas or [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1110.04s)]
*  as a purple district somewhere [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1111.8400000000001s)]
*  else, right, like in a southern [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1114.0800000000002s)]
*  state. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1116.4s)]
*  And so you have to really kind of [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1117.72s)]
*  be focused on your thing there and [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1119.5600000000002s)]
*  what's going on there and really [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1121.72s)]
*  pay attention there and make sure [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1123.76s)]
*  you got the pulse of your district. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1125.8400000000001s)]
*  And again, right, [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1128.04s)]
*  people just kind of laugh when you [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1129.12s)]
*  hear these messages and they say, [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1131.0s)]
*  when you go back, [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1133.08s)]
*  go get on local TV when you're back [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1134.04s)]
*  in your district. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1135.8799999999999s)]
*  Nobody gives a damn about [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1136.96s)]
*  the congressmen here. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1138.48s)]
*  That may work in Iowa, [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1139.9199999999998s)]
*  that may work in Louisiana, but [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1141.96s)]
*  in Los Angeles where it's [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1144.6s)]
*  the second largest media market, [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1146.6s)]
*  they don't give a damn about their [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1149.24s)]
*  members of Congress, right? [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1151.6s)]
*  We're a dime a dozen over here, [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1153.6s)]
*  there's a lot of us. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1155.24s)]
*  And so it's not easy to kind of do [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1156.3999999999999s)]
*  that, right? [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1158.64s)]
*  To get the message out, etc. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1159.76s)]
*  Right, okay, that makes sense. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1161.44s)]
*  So but it is a literal question, [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1163.0400000000002s)]
*  like does the caucus ever get [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1164.92s)]
*  together? [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1166.68s)]
*  And for example, [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1167.8400000000001s)]
*  let's make up a hypothetical here. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1168.5600000000002s)]
*  Hakeem Jeffries says, hey guys, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1170.24s)]
*  this is the direction we think in [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1171.72s)]
*  leadership we should go. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1173.24s)]
*  And then they provide space for [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1174.6000000000001s)]
*  someone else to raise their hand [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1176.44s)]
*  and go, well, I think maybe we [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1178.2800000000002s)]
*  should go in a different direction, [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1179.8000000000002s)]
*  right? [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1181.48s)]
*  Does that happen? [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1182.0400000000002s)]
*  We have a caucus meeting every, [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1183.0400000000002s)]
*  why don't say every day at this [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1184.88s)]
*  time, it'll be around Tuesday, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1186.5600000000002s)]
*  next Tuesday is the flying day. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1188.84s)]
*  So the caucus meeting will be in on [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1190.12s)]
*  Wednesday. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1191.7199999999998s)]
*  But it's usually either Tuesday or [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1192.84s)]
*  Wednesday depending on what day we [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1194.6s)]
*  fly in. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1196.1599999999999s)]
*  But yeah, and those are open [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1196.7199999999998s)]
*  discussions, right? [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1198.28s)]
*  Where people are allowed to kind of [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1199.6399999999999s)]
*  talk about what's going on and [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1201.6399999999999s)]
*  give their two cents and their [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1203.36s)]
*  thoughts about what we need to do [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1205.08s)]
*  and what changes need to be made. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1207.0s)]
*  So yeah, there is a forum for that. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1209.1999999999998s)]
*  And do people ever brawl there or [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1212.6799999999998s)]
*  is this super polite? [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1214.76s)]
*  No, I'm serious because they're [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1216.4399999999998s)]
*  progressives and the more [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1218.28s)]
*  conservative members really [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1220.04s)]
*  disagree on a bunch of things. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1222.04s)]
*  I mean, I think they do, [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1224.72s)]
*  they say that they do publicly. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1226.0s)]
*  So do they disagree internally? [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1228.24s)]
*  No, there's disagreement, right? [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1230.76s)]
*  But it's never ever that I've seen [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1233.8799999999999s)]
*  where it's come to like a brawl or [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1236.08s)]
*  really being like- [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1238.24s)]
*  No, I don't mean physically, but [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1239.44s)]
*  like more like you raise voices, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1241.08s)]
*  things like that. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1242.72s)]
*  No, I don't think I've never really [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1243.6s)]
*  seen that, right? [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1245.32s)]
*  Look, I think you'll hear about [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1247.0s)]
*  that like in the Republican [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1248.76s)]
*  caucuses, right? [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1250.32s)]
*  Where they're kind of there, [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1251.56s)]
*  like people are getting up and [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1252.84s)]
*  they're shouting at each other and [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1254.1999999999998s)]
*  you need to get in line and [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1255.9199999999998s)]
*  to do this. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1257.1599999999999s)]
*  And I have never ever seen that in [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1257.8799999999999s)]
*  one of our meetings. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1259.8s)]
*  But that doesn't mean people don't [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1261.9599999999998s)]
*  disagree and I think it is kind of [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1263.3999999999999s)]
*  polite in the way that we kind of [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1264.76s)]
*  do that, right? [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1266.08s)]
*  Look, you have the time, [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1268.0s)]
*  there's the caucus meeting where [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1269.2399999999998s)]
*  you bring that things up. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1270.9199999999998s)]
*  And then if you have disagreements [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1272.08s)]
*  or things like that, you can go and [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1273.6799999999998s)]
*  talk to your members. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1275.32s)]
*  Usually the best time to do that [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1276.48s)]
*  is when you're all there on [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1278.04s)]
*  the floor for boats. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1279.28s)]
*  And so you can talk about these [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1280.4399999999998s)]
*  things, right? [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1282.04s)]
*  Yeah, and one more that's slightly [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1283.1599999999999s)]
*  more collegial and [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1285.36s)]
*  then I'll ask about policy. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1286.52s)]
*  Which is, do you guys ever go [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1288.1599999999999s)]
*  bowling together? [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1290.52s)]
*  Like forget bowling, but seriously. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1292.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1295.04s)]
*  Like do people go out for, hey, [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1295.56s)]
*  Susie, how you doing? [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1297.36s)]
*  Let's go out for drinks or etc. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1298.56s)]
*  Does that happen with some [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1300.6s)]
*  regularity? [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1301.8s)]
*  It does, right? [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1302.9199999999998s)]
*  Some are organized, [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1303.8799999999999s)]
*  some are just kind of like, hey, [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1305.24s)]
*  let's go, why don't we go to [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1307.68s)]
*  the Dim Club and go get a drink or [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1309.68s)]
*  let's go get dinner over here. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1312.08s)]
*  But I mean, actually I'm going to [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1314.36s)]
*  a dinner on, I think the 9th? [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1316.36s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know, [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1318.36s)]
*  I gotta check the count. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1319.1200000000001s)]
*  But I'm going to a dinner, [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1320.04s)]
*  it's going to be a bunch of my [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1321.36s)]
*  freshman colleagues from the Dem [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1322.76s)]
*  side. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1324.28s)]
*  I think Adam Schiff is going to [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1324.8s)]
*  join us and it's a little more [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1326.52s)]
*  organized, but it is there, right? [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1328.16s)]
*  We do that. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1330.36s)]
*  And actually we had a good one, [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1331.16s)]
*  another one of my freshman [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1332.8s)]
*  colleagues hosted a dinner at her [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1334.24s)]
*  apartment, her place last week. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1336.6000000000001s)]
*  Okay, that's good, I like that. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1338.92s)]
*  And you get to be a freshman [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1341.92s)]
*  all over again. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1343.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1344.0800000000002s)]
*  So that's fun. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1344.5800000000002s)]
*  I'm a redshirt freshman this time [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1345.0800000000002s)]
*  around. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1346.52s)]
*  Redshirt freshman, there you go. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1347.02s)]
*  Okay, so tell me what you think is [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1348.68s)]
*  the right direction for [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1350.2s)]
*  the Democratic Party. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1351.28s)]
*  Look, I think we need to reconnect [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1352.32s)]
*  with people, right? [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1354.8s)]
*  And the thing that really kind of [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1356.32s)]
*  upsets me more is, [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1358.56s)]
*  I think it's the fact that [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1359.88s)]
*  really kind of upsets me more is [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1361.76s)]
*  that I hear about all the things [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1363.84s)]
*  you hear is that when it comes to [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1366.04s)]
*  economic issues that people put [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1368.16s)]
*  more trust in the Republican Party [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1370.5s)]
*  and Donald Trump and [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1373.0s)]
*  the Republican Party than Democrats [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1374.4s)]
*  do. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1377.08s)]
*  But you look at the last three [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1377.6000000000001s)]
*  Republican presidential [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1379.32s)]
*  administrations, they've all ended [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1381.0s)]
*  in financial chaos. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1383.24s)]
*  And so- [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1384.68s)]
*  Yeah, it's literal. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1385.68s)]
*  Why aren't we out there talking [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1386.76s)]
*  about that more? [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1388.44s)]
*  Why aren't we kind of saying, [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1389.44s)]
*  it's always taking Democrats to get [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1391.44s)]
*  the House back in order. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1393.72s)]
*  It always hasn't been pretty, but [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1395.24s)]
*  it's gotten done and [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1397.3999999999999s)]
*  we've done it, right? [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1398.6s)]
*  And so these are the things that [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1400.2s)]
*  we need to talk about. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1402.0s)]
*  That's the message that we have to [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1403.36s)]
*  talk to the working people to let [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1405.52s)]
*  them know that you've always been [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1407.56s)]
*  better off with us. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1409.7s)]
*  So two things about that. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1411.0s)]
*  So one is messaging, [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1413.08s)]
*  one is substance. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1414.24s)]
*  On the messaging part, [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1415.44s)]
*  I literally don't know why they [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1417.0s)]
*  can't get that message out. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1418.96s)]
*  And that's what I'm curious to ask [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1421.28s)]
*  you about. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1422.84s)]
*  Because, so for example, [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1423.36s)]
*  if I'm on a show and they start, [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1424.6399999999999s)]
*  some right-winger starts telling me [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1426.08s)]
*  about how they like to balance [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1427.76s)]
*  budgets, I go, nonsense. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1429.08s)]
*  They've never done it. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1430.9199999999998s)]
*  The last Republican president to [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1431.76s)]
*  balance a budget was Dwight Eisenhower, [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1433.44s)]
*  right? [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1435.44s)]
*  And so all they do is massive tax [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1435.96s)]
*  costs for the rich and [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1437.84s)]
*  a huge amount of the deficit, etc. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1438.96s)]
*  So I know I've done it, it's easy. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1440.9199999999998s)]
*  Why do I never see Democrats doing [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1445.1599999999999s)]
*  it on TV? [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1447.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's something that's got to [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1448.6000000000001s)]
*  change, right? [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1450.4s)]
*  And we need to talk about this [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1451.3600000000001s)]
*  more and we need to talk about [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1452.8600000000001s)]
*  the financial ruin that we are [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1454.3600000000001s)]
*  headed down with this current [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1455.92s)]
*  president just like how he led us [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1457.44s)]
*  towards financial ruin. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1459.0400000000002s)]
*  The last time around, right? [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1460.3600000000001s)]
*  He only wants to take credit for [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1462.5600000000002s)]
*  things that are going well and [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1464.16s)]
*  trying to pass. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1465.72s)]
*  We've had the worst quarter [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1466.64s)]
*  financially that we had in recent [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1468.48s)]
*  history that I can remember, right? [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1470.8400000000001s)]
*  That it's, I think that anybody can [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1473.48s)]
*  remember. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1475.44s)]
*  He's still trying to blame it on [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1476.44s)]
*  Joe Biden when it was him who [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1477.8799999999999s)]
*  let us down this way, right? [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1478.96s)]
*  But these are the things that we [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1480.32s)]
*  need to talk about and we got to [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1481.92s)]
*  find a way to connect with people. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1483.68s)]
*  This representative Jeffries are [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1486.44s)]
*  speaking well, [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1488.36s)]
*  leader Jeffries, I guess. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1489.32s)]
*  Does he go all right, look, [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1491.0s)]
*  Gil, I need you on K cal and [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1493.04s)]
*  Susie I need you and KGO and [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1495.1399999999999s)]

*  And let's go or does that kind of [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1501.32s)]
*  coordination not happen? [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1503.16s)]
*  That doesn't really happen. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1505.0s)]
*  We have the the the DPCC, [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1506.76s)]
*  which is right like our messaging [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1508.3600000000001s)]

*  okay, let's focus on social security [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1529.18s)]

*  this is the turn that we have to [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1554.48s)]
*  make in order to connect with [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1556.2s)]
*  people because I mean, [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1557.74s)]
*  to be frank, right? [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1559.02s)]
*  The traditional media is kind of [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1560.2s)]
*  dying. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1562.0s)]
*  Yep, and you got your own podcast, [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1563.04s)]
*  like I said earlier, I was on it, [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1564.76s)]
*  who then we'll come back to that [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1566.32s)]
*  in a sec. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1567.76s)]
*  But so in terms of the direction, [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1568.28s)]
*  so okay, so the Republicans are bad [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1570.24s)]
*  at financial management and [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1572.34s)]
*  the management of the economy and [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1573.96s)]
*  the budget there and those are [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1575.92s)]
*  facts. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1577.72s)]
*  Donald Trump added more to [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1578.28s)]
*  the deficit than any other [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1579.8799999999999s)]
*  president in US history. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1581.48s)]
*  That's a point I have not heard a [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1583.52s)]
*  single Democrat ever make in media. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1585.32s)]
*  I don't know why, [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1587.44s)]
*  it just drives me crazy they don't [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1588.2s)]
*  make that point, right? [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1589.76s)]
*  And it allows the Republicans to [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1591.04s)]
*  feel like they're fiscally [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1592.28s)]
*  responsible when they're drunk [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1593.58s)]
*  sailors. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1594.92s)]
*  No offense, I know you were [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1595.48s)]
*  in the Navy. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1596.84s)]
*  Okay, when it comes to the budget. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1597.48s)]
*  But how about the Democrats? [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1599.8799999999999s)]
*  Because when they get into power, [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1603.12s)]
*  they say we're going to do this, [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1604.8799999999999s)]
*  this and this and [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1606.52s)]
*  the general feeling and [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1607.48s)]
*  my feeling is they don't. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1608.8s)]
*  So paid families at 84%, [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1611.16s)]
*  they never passed it. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1613.12s)]
*  Joe Biden said he was going to do [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1615.08s)]
*  minimum wage, he took it out of [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1616.56s)]
*  the first bill. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1618.0s)]
*  He said he was going to do public [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1619.48s)]
*  option, didn't even introduce it. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1620.68s)]
*  So aren't people right to be [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1622.36s)]
*  frustrated about Democrats? [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1624.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think you're right, right? [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1626.68s)]
*  There is a frustration out there [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1629.8799999999999s)]
*  and we're feeling it right now. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1631.44s)]
*  And I think we felt it in [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1633.52s)]
*  the presidential election, [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1635.12s)]
*  obviously, right? [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1637.12s)]
*  That people didn't get what they [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1638.3999999999999s)]
*  were told, right? [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1640.3999999999999s)]
*  But things in Congress move very [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1641.56s)]
*  slowly. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1643.6399999999999s)]
*  And we do need a minimum wage, [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1644.84s)]
*  right? [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1646.56s)]
*  And Joe Biden, he couldn't get it [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1647.2s)]
*  in the bill, but he was able to do [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1648.72s)]
*  it for federal workers, right? [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1650.2s)]
*  So every employee that I had that [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1651.76s)]
*  worked for me, we raised their [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1653.68s)]
*  minimum wage and kind of do it, [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1655.6s)]
*  tried to do what you can. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1657.56s)]
*  He was able to do that through [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1659.8s)]
*  an executive order. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1661.2s)]
*  Hopefully it stays that way. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1662.24s)]
*  It doesn't get reversed by- [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1664.56s)]
*  Yeah, now that we're talking about [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1666.72s)]
*  it out loud, I'm a little worried. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1668.2s)]
*  Yeah, okay, just don't say it in [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1669.48s)]
*  Washington, okay? [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1671.08s)]
*  But you're right to give Biden [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1672.52s)]
*  credit on that. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1673.8799999999999s)]
*  But it's not that he couldn't get [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1674.8s)]
*  it done, he took it out of the bill. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1676.76s)]
*  Yeah, well, [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1679.0s)]
*  he was looking at the bigger [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1679.96s)]
*  picture, I think, right? [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1681.68s)]
*  And these are the things that we [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1683.1200000000001s)]
*  have to do. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1684.44s)]
*  The infrastructure bill was massive [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1685.0400000000002s)]
*  and it put a lot of people to work. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1687.0800000000002s)]
*  The unions loved it. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1689.68s)]
*  And I remember one of the union [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1690.7600000000002s)]
*  guys was like, we've never had so [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1692.2s)]
*  much work before and that I can [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1693.92s)]
*  remember. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1695.6000000000001s)]
*  And so that's kind of what he was [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1697.0s)]
*  looking at, that's what he was [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1698.8000000000002s)]
*  doing and it's just unfortunate, [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1700.68s)]
*  like you said, right? [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1702.7600000000002s)]
*  The sacrificial land for that kind [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1704.0400000000002s)]
*  of became the minimum wage in order [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1706.2800000000002s)]
*  to get the bigger bill done. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1708.8s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, well, okay, so [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1711.2s)]
*  I'm going to ask you a question, [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1712.6s)]
*  I don't know if you can answer or [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1714.32s)]
*  not, but if there's a vote that's [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1716.08s)]
*  coming up on something like a [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1718.04s)]
*  higher minimum wage or [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1719.8s)]
*  anything along those lines. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1721.36s)]
*  Do donors come to you, [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1723.92s)]
*  National Restaurant Association or [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1725.36s)]
*  whoever, and go, you better not? [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1727.92s)]
*  Or a more subtle, sophisticated, [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1730.44s)]
*  nuanced way of saying, [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1732.68s)]
*  you better not? [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1734.08s)]
*  I think people always kind of come [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1735.88s)]
*  to you with sides, right? [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1738.48s)]
*  Like, hey, this is what I believe, [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1741.4s)]
*  this is what I believe. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1743.8000000000002s)]
*  I won't say the company or [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1745.5600000000002s)]
*  I won't say all right, but [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1747.3200000000002s)]
*  AM radio is becoming a thing right [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1749.2s)]
*  now, right? [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1751.5600000000002s)]
*  And I've had some people say, [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1752.6000000000001s)]
*  do we still need this in the car? [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1754.6000000000001s)]
*  And I'm like, well, [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1757.7600000000002s)]
*  here's my thoughts on it, right? [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1758.8000000000002s)]
*  I actually think we do, right? [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1760.3200000000002s)]
*  Because it can become, [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1761.72s)]
*  when emergencies happen, [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1763.92s)]
*  AM radio, the frequency goes [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1766.0s)]
*  farther, that may be your only [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1768.6s)]
*  lifeline that you have, right? [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1771.28s)]
*  If something ever really did [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1773.16s)]
*  happen where communications kind of [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1774.52s)]
*  went down, AM radio may be your [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1776.36s)]
*  last way to connect. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1777.96s)]
*  And so I think it is still [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1780.56s)]
*  important to have it in there. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1782.04s)]
*  But to me, if people come at me [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1783.68s)]
*  with issues, I'm going to tell them, [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1785.52s)]
*  okay, I hear you, but [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1787.88s)]
*  here's what I think on the issue. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1789.32s)]
*  Especially if it is different, and [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1792.64s)]
*  I'm going to vote the way that I [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1794.28s)]
*  feel that I need to vote, right? [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1795.6s)]
*  And the way that I feel that the [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1797.16s)]
*  people in the district that who [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1798.56s)]
*  elected me want me to vote. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1799.92s)]
*  All right, one more on that, but [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1801.48s)]
*  again, I don't know if you can [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1802.72s)]
*  answer, but has there ever been [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1803.8s)]
*  a vote you had where the donor then [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1805.0s)]
*  took away the money afterwards [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1806.4s)]
*  because you didn't vote in [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1807.6s)]
*  their direction? [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1808.68s)]
*  No, but again, I will say this too, [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1811.32s)]
*  right? [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1813.16s)]
*  Most of my elections, [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1813.68s)]
*  actually the two have been [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1815.76s)]
*  self-funded, so- [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1818.12s)]
*  So it kind of- [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1819.8s)]
*  That makes it easier. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1820.68s)]
*  It does kind of make it easier in [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1821.6s)]
*  that sense where I can kind of go [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1823.52s)]
*  and say like, hey, but yeah, [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1825.52s)]
*  I'm going to vote the way I want to [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1827.6s)]
*  vote, right? [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1829.84s)]
*  I'm listening to the guy who did [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1830.72s)]
*  that. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1832.68s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, no, you've got that [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1833.2s)]
*  luxury, which is great. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1835.3999999999999s)]
*  So you signed the populist plank [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1837.1599999999999s)]
*  today, right? [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1839.56s)]
*  So which is awesome, and it's a [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1841.12s)]
*  huge range of people that sign it [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1842.8799999999999s)]
*  all the way from independents like [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1844.84s)]
*  Dan Osborne in Nebraska to [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1846.9199999999998s)]
*  progressives like Ro Khanna to [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1848.6799999999998s)]
*  yourself, etc. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1850.8s)]
*  So that's got the six policy [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1852.32s)]
*  planks, anti-war, money out of [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1854.24s)]
*  politics, paid family leave, [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1856.3999999999999s)]
*  higher minimum wage, lower drug [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1858.3999999999999s)]
*  prices, lower housing prices. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1860.36s)]
*  So do you think that that's [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1862.1599999999999s)]
*  the right direction for [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1863.48s)]
*  the Democratic Party to focus on [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1864.7199999999998s)]
*  that kind of economic populism, [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1866.4399999999998s)]
*  the core Democratic policy issues? [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1868.12s)]
*  Yeah, look, I think the plank that [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1870.36s)]
*  you have going forward, right, [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1872.56s)]
*  is they're all issues that I think [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1874.6s)]
*  Democrats should be on board with. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1876.68s)]
*  And I would be hard to find [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1878.76s)]
*  a Democrat that wouldn't agree with [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1880.6000000000001s)]
*  those issues. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1883.16s)]
*  Well, that's nice to hear, okay, [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1884.2s)]
*  that's great. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1886.44s)]
*  So that's on tyt.com or [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1887.48s)]
*  populistplank.com. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1889.16s)]
*  So and I like that it's uniting [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1891.0800000000002s)]
*  people, but there are issues that [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1893.0400000000002s)]
*  don't unite people, right? [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1895.2800000000002s)]
*  So what's the sense in the caucus [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1897.3200000000002s)]
*  about culture wars, identity [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1899.72s)]
*  politics? [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1901.96s)]
*  And look, a lot of times it gets [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1902.72s)]
*  thrust on you from the Republicans [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1904.44s)]
*  that they'll do an attack or [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1907.2s)]
*  a bill against trans people or [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1908.76s)]
*  this people or that people. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1910.56s)]
*  They'll take people who have [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1913.1200000000001s)]
*  a legal right to stay here and [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1914.72s)]
*  send them to a dungeon in [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1916.3s)]
*  El Salvador. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1917.48s)]
*  Then what are you going to do? [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1918.68s)]
*  You got to fight back, etc. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1919.56s)]
*  But is there a feeling in the air [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1921.4s)]
*  in DC like that stuff didn't help [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1923.64s)]
*  us, we got to get away from that? [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1926.16s)]
*  Look, there's always going to be, [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1928.88s)]
*  I think, somebody who says, [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1931.8s)]
*  yeah, we need to stay away from [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1934.12s)]
*  that, right? [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1936.52s)]
*  That's just kind of like, [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1937.84s)]
*  it's like the Republicans are just [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1939.6s)]
*  throwing bait out there for us to [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1942.0s)]
*  kind of like attach to and [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1944.2399999999998s)]
*  then they're just going to go off [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1945.9199999999998s)]
*  and say like, that's all they care [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1948.1599999999999s)]
*  about, that's all they want to do. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1950.4799999999998s)]
*  And there are people like that, but [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1953.04s)]
*  it is important, I think, [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1954.6399999999999s)]
*  to kind of address these issues, [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1955.9199999999998s)]
*  right? [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1957.7199999999998s)]
*  I was a diversity and [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1958.28s)]
*  inclusion officer. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1959.04s)]
*  Diversity is very important to me. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1959.9199999999998s)]
*  When I was at the Pentagon, [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1961.2399999999998s)]
*  I was a diversity officer. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1962.64s)]
*  If you were still there, [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1964.24s)]
*  they would have fired you. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1965.0s)]
*  Yeah, I would have been gone. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1966.0400000000002s)]
*  And the fact is, [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1967.5200000000002s)]
*  a lot of those diversity issues [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1968.6000000000001s)]
*  that we were implementing were [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1970.72s)]
*  signed into law by Donald Trump. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1972.92s)]
*  That's another thing nobody ever [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1975.76s)]
*  talks about. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1977.3200000000002s)]
*  The position that he created, [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1977.96s)]
*  the position I had was created [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1979.8400000000001s)]
*  that he signed into law, right? [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1981.76s)]
*  And it was something that they did [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1983.96s)]
*  talk about right there. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1985.92s)]
*  Esper talked about diversity in [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1987.88s)]
*  the military and how important it [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1989.48s)]
*  is and that we need it. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1991.24s)]
*  But now it's, again, [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1993.04s)]
*  he's running away from that. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1994.6799999999998s)]
*  But it is something that needs to [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1996.6799999999998s)]
*  be brought there and [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=1998.72s)]
*  kind of brought up, right? [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2000.0s)]
*  And kind of thrown back at him. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2001.52s)]
*  It's like, everything you're [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2002.96s)]
*  undoing right now was actually done [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2005.56s)]
*  by you. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2008.2s)]
*  Yeah, okay, so [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2009.2s)]
*  that's a good point. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2009.8799999999999s)]
*  And even on some trans issues, [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2010.84s)]
*  Trump was the guy who did it in [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2012.8s)]
*  the first place, right? [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2014.72s)]
*  Well, that one, he's never been on [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2016.3999999999999s)]
*  the right side there, [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2018.3999999999999s)]
*  I will say, right? [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2019.52s)]
*  He did always try and [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2020.48s)]
*  get transgender service members [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2022.16s)]
*  out, right? [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2023.92s)]
*  And he couldn't do it the first [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2024.5600000000002s)]
*  time around. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2026.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2027.1200000000001s)]
*  And so the reason I said that, [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2027.64s)]
*  sorry to interrupt this, [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2029.5600000000002s)]
*  because that famous ad against [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2031.3200000000002s)]
*  Kamala Harris where that policy of [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2033.48s)]
*  giving undocumented trans [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2036.2s)]
*  detainees free surgery, [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2038.44s)]
*  that actually existed in [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2040.44s)]
*  the Trump administration. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2042.3600000000001s)]
*  They made it seem like, [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2045.16s)]
*  he would never do that. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2046.24s)]
*  But it actually was actually [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2047.16s)]
*  the policy in the Trump [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2048.7200000000003s)]
*  administration. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2049.8s)]
*  So that's why I brought it up. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2051.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2052.36s)]
*  No, it is, but look, I think we [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2054.1600000000003s)]
*  need to defend people that are [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2056.48s)]
*  being attacked right now. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2058.6400000000003s)]
*  We need to stick up for them. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2060.76s)]
*  So that needs to happen. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2064.48s)]
*  But I think some people, [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2066.2000000000003s)]
*  we got to be cautious of going down [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2067.5600000000004s)]
*  that rabbit hole too, though, right? [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2069.52s)]
*  I think of kind of being led there. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2071.5600000000004s)]
*  It's a kind of where it becomes, [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2073.2000000000003s)]
*  like you said, right? [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2074.6000000000004s)]
*  This was his policy. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2075.6000000000004s)]
*  That's what he did to his [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2077.1200000000003s)]
*  administration, but [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2078.28s)]
*  they've attached this to us, right? [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2079.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2082.16s)]
*  We can't, look, again, [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2082.68s)]
*  we need to defend, but [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2085.24s)]
*  we got to be cautious. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2087.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, and so I look, [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2090.12s)]
*  I don't think it's that hard. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2091.24s)]
*  But I get that some people have [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2093.0s)]
*  a difficult time drawing the lines. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2094.6s)]
*  So somebody, they take someone who [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2096.6s)]
*  has a court has ordered to stay [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2098.52s)]

*  dungeon in El Salvador. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2101.6s)]
*  No, there's a court order. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2103.16s)]
*  That's not close, right? [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2104.3599999999997s)]
*  And this is an identity politics. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2106.0s)]
*  There's a freaking court order, [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2107.3599999999997s)]
*  right? [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2108.8399999999997s)]
*  And you're violating the [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2109.3599999999997s)]
*  constitution when you don't listen [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2110.68s)]

*  He couldn't answer the simple [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2113.9199999999996s)]
*  question, right? [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2115.48s)]
*  Is it do you need to defend [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2116.48s)]
*  the constitution? [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2118.08s)]
*  He said, I don't know if that's my [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2119.64s)]
*  responsibility. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2121.2s)]
*  Yeah, it's definitely [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2123.12s)]
*  your responsibility. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2124.16s)]

*  said, right? [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2126.12s)]
*  After you said state your name, [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2126.64s)]
*  after you state your name, [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2128.3599999999997s)]

*  You said it, right? [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2137.64s)]

*  Yeah, and look, I don't know how [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2140.48s)]
*  you feel about this, so I'll ask [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2141.84s)]

*  My opinion is that trans girls [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2156.48s)]

*  sports in high school, okay? [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2161.1200000000003s)]

*  Now other people disagree and [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmuMxfhuyE&t=2169.52s)]
