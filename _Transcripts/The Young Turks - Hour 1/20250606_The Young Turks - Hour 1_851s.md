On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.
Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.
Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

# Trump JUST CAN'T STOP Throwing Jabs At Elon Musk
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs)
*  Joining us now, someone who just got off the phone with the president. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=0.0s)]
*  Diana, what did he tell you? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=3.2600000000000002s)]
*  Well, he said that he's quote, well, here's exactly what he said, quote, I'm not even [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  thinking about Elon. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=9.6s)]
*  He's got a problem. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=10.96s)]
*  The poor guy's got a problem. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=12.64s)]
*  He said he won't be speaking to him for a while, but he said he wishes Elon Musk well. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=15.08s)]
*  Donald Trump is still throwing some jabs at Elon Musk a day after their explosive public [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=22.56s)]
*  showdown. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=28.84s)]
*  But is there hope for a reconciliation? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=29.84s)]
*  We'll give you the latest on the spat between the two. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=32.56s)]
*  But first, Cenk, what are your thoughts overall now? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=35.4s)]
*  24 hours removed from the first public brawl. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=38.4s)]
*  I'm not thinking about it. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=42.8s)]
*  I just know that Elon's got a big problem, you know what I mean? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=43.96s)]
*  New York Times story about the ketamine. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=47.4s)]
*  I mean, I'm not thinking about it. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=48.96s)]
*  I just say he's got a problem. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=50.68s)]
*  Okay, so these guys have too big an ego to just let it go. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=52.56s)]
*  So there's a lot more where this came from. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=57.66s)]
*  And I think the super interesting question is, how do they move forward? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=59.6s)]
*  Do they pass a bill? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=64.8s)]
*  Do they not pass a bill? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=66.18s)]
*  Do some Republicans go on Trump's side? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=68.12s)]
*  Do some go on Musk's side? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=70.12s)]
*  And what does it mean to go on Musk's side? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=72.36s)]
*  There's so many interesting questions. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=74.12s)]
*  So let's hear more about what's going on and then we'll analyze it. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=76.44s)]
*  After a full day of brutal attacks back and forth, things have calmed down a bit between [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=81.16s)]
*  Donald and Elon. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=86.52000000000001s)]
*  But there's also some clear indication that Trump still wants revenge. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=87.96s)]
*  Starting with his plans for a Tesla he bought and put on display at the White House just [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=93.16s)]
*  a few months ago. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=97.32s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=98.75999999999999s)]
*  When you walk to the broadcasting tents here on the north side, you see West Executive [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=99.75999999999999s)]
*  Drive. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=104.32s)]
*  That's the driveway between the White House and the old executive office building. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=105.32s)]
*  There is a Tesla there that President Trump bought during a Tesla demo on the South Lawn [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=109.46s)]
*  a few months ago to try to help Elon Musk's business while it was being vandalized. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=114.44s)]
*  We are told that that Tesla still sitting there, the red Tesla with Florida tags, is [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=118.48s)]
*  either going to be given away or sold off. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=123.03999999999999s)]
*  ABC's Jonathan Karl also reported earlier today that in a phone conversation this morning, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=126.76s)]
*  real Donald Trump told Jonathan Karl that Elon Musk is the man who has lost his mind. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=133.32s)]
*  Trump did not, however, seem angry or even concerned about the feud. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=139.98s)]
*  As for reports that there is going to be a Trump and Musk call scheduled for today, Trump [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=144.45999999999998s)]
*  told me that he is not particularly interested in talking to Musk, although he says Musk [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=150.26s)]
*  wants to talk to him. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=155.54s)]
*  Elon Musk, on the other hand, seems a bit more willing to put down his sword or in this [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=157.26s)]
*  case his phone, despite calling for Trump's impeachment and accusing him of being in the [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=162.01999999999998s)]
*  Epstein files 24 hours ago. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=167.06s)]
*  Hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, who is an ally of both men, wrote on X, I support real [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=170.22s)]
*  Donald Trump and Elon Musk, and they should make peace for the benefit of our great country. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=175.9s)]
*  We are much stronger together than apart, to which Musk responded, you're not wrong. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=182.42000000000002s)]
*  In addition, after originally threatening to decommission a SpaceX capsule called Dragon [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=189.54000000000002s)]
*  that's used to take astronauts and supplies to the ISS, he walked it back. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=196.34s)]
*  You can see this exchange here. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=202.26000000000002s)]
*  This is a shame, this back and forth. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=203.82000000000002s)]
*  You are both better than this. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=205.74s)]
*  Cool off and take a step back for a couple days. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=207.62s)]
*  And he said, good advice. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=210.14000000000001s)]
*  Okay, we won't decommission Dragon. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=211.94s)]
*  However, Elon is still speaking out about the spending bill that started this whole [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=214.78s)]
*  fight in the first place and has reposted predictions that Republicans will lose in [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=219.62s)]
*  the 2026 midterms. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=225.06s)]
*  So, Cenk, my question to you is will this feud ever be resolved? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=226.74s)]
*  Yeah, that's a great question. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=231.78s)]
*  I really don't know. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=233.38s)]
*  Again, it's not a statement I make often on the show. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=234.38s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=237.66000000000003s)]
*  But they have two giant egos. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=239.22s)]
*  On top of that, they're both deeply unstable. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=241.22s)]
*  They're constantly flying off the handle. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=244.5s)]
*  I mean, Trump's the king of that, right? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=246.34s)]
*  Normally, this time, Elon definitely started the fight. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=248.38s)]
*  And then you look at that story that the New York Times had about. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=251.66s)]
*  Now look, it's impossible to know what to believe and trust. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=256.3s)]
*  And I know the New York Times is sometimes very accurate and sometimes not at all accurate. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=260.86s)]
*  But their reporting is that Elon's taking a significant amount of drugs, right? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=265.78000000000003s)]
*  Not a little, but apparently a lot, daily, right? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=273.02s)]
*  So do with that what you will. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=276.74s)]
*  Could that lead him to flying off the handle? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=280.09999999999997s)]
*  Sure could. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=282.7s)]
*  Is he gonna solve that? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=284.7s)]
*  I don't know about that. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=285.9s)]
*  Are they gonna solve their egos? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=287.06s)]
*  No. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=288.29999999999995s)]
*  Is Trump going to resolve his lack of mental stability? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=289.29999999999995s)]
*  No. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=293.29999999999995s)]
*  But on the other hand, Trump is a king of bygones be bygones. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=294.29999999999995s)]
*  His vice president called him Hitler before, and he let that go and picked him to be VP. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=299.09999999999997s)]
*  So you never know, right? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=304.97999999999996s)]
*  Overall, to me, one of the interesting things about this is like, yeah, okay, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=308.82s)]
*  we're all talking about the cat fight. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=312.02s)]
*  But what are you going to do with the bill? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=313.74s)]
*  Is Elon right that there's not enough cuts? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=316.5s)]
*  I don't agree with that. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=320.06s)]
*  I think there are too many cuts. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=321.78s)]
*  Is he right? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=323.62s)]
*  Recently, he liked and reposted a post about how there's too many tax cuts in the bill. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=324.78s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=331.41999999999996s)]
*  I think he's right about that, if he believes that. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=332.5s)]
*  And that it creates way too much of a deficit. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=335.21999999999997s)]
*  I think he's right about that. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=337.26s)]
*  And so we'll talk more about this as we go, particularly the MAGA reaction and [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=338.78s)]
*  how they're split. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=343.26s)]
*  But I did do a poll on Twitter for what it's worth, and it is on X, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=344.42s)]
*  which is Elon's platform. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=350.21999999999997s)]
*  But generally, whose side are you on? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=351.94s)]
*  And with around 20,000 votes so far, it's 63,37. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=354.06s)]
*  Elon, interesting. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=359.53999999999996s)]
*  So Jackson, what do you think? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=362.74s)]
*  That is interesting that it's that percentage for Elon. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=364.82s)]
*  I think that goes to show a lot of just kind of how prevalent Donald Trump has [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=368.5s)]
*  become within the country's psyche. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=373.18s)]
*  Where I guess we're a little bit more used to dealing with him being head on, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=375.54s)]
*  maybe that's it. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=379.74s)]
*  But for me, I think this is an interesting situation because Elon Musk [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=381.26s)]
*  really needs to tread lightly. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=384.82s)]
*  because at the end of the day, and never ever forget the tweet that Donald Trump [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=386.14s)]
*  put out in his first administration where he basically says something along the lines [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=389.86s)]
*  of, if Elon Musk didn't get all the government subsidies that he does, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=393.26s)]
*  he will be worthless, among other things. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=396.86s)]
*  That's essentially what he said. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=399.14s)]
*  And a couple days ago, he kind of tweeted something out that kind of alluded to, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=400.38s)]
*  like, it'd be a shame, you know what I'm saying, if we cut those subsidies off. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=403.94s)]
*  So he really needs to tread lightly because right now, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=407.34s)]
*  Donald Trump just has way more power than than Elon. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=410.18s)]
*  Also, Elon Musk is in a bad position when it comes to the companies that he's [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=414.06s)]
*  the CEO of because as we know, he didn't invent these products. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=417.7s)]
*  And as you pointed out, he's on a whole cocktail of drugs. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=421.34000000000003s)]
*  It's not like he's just, I got a little bit of a coke problem. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=423.90000000000003s)]
*  He got an everything problem all day. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=426.38s)]
*  And actually, I remember back in 2018, when I found a Politiscope, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=428.94s)]
*  some of the venture capitalists that we were dealing with and stuff, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=432.3s)]
*  they said that about him years ago. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=434.62s)]
*  They were like, yeah, Elon Musk is ripped out of his mind constantly. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=436.22s)]
*  And anybody who's been following me for any amount of time knows I have long [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=439.58000000000004s)]
*  despised Elon Musk. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=443.06s)]
*  So this is just a glorious time for me. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=444.38s)]
*  But when it comes to Doge, I mean, at the end of the day, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=447.18s)]
*  the goal for them to cut $2 trillion was obviously a complete failure, but [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=450.06s)]
*  he still caused a lot of damage, firing people all across the administrative [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=454.29999999999995s)]
*  state, making cuts to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=458.38s)]
*  meals on wheels, food stamps, going after Medicaid, which isn't anything new, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=462.53999999999996s)]
*  causing troubles for Social Security, the Veterans Affairs, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=468.21999999999997s)]
*  pretty much everything within the administrative state. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=471.26s)]
*  They're trying to gut it, which again is nothing new. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=474.7s)]
*  But overall, Elon Musk has been a failure in his position, and [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=476.94s)]
*  he should probably take it easy a little bit before he loses his subsidies. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=479.97999999999996s)]
*  I think you touched on it, you hit the nail on the head in what you touched on [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=483.85999999999996s)]
*  in the first part of your comments. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=488.06s)]
*  I think if we're going to talk about whether or [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=489.41999999999996s)]
*  not these two can reconcile, it depends on their egos. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=491.41999999999996s)]
*  And if their egos continue to get in the way, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=494.34s)]
*  I don't see a stable path forward where they can live in harmony. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=497.02s)]
*  This is what fueled it. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=502.06s)]
*  You saw Musk bringing up the Epstein documents and [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=503.46000000000004s)]
*  Trump talking about cutting Elon's contracts. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=507.02000000000004s)]
*  I mean, they're both getting to what they know will get under each other's skin. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=511.18s)]
*  The right, as we'll get into in our next block, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=515.7s)]
*  has tried to spin this as two guys debating. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=517.62s)]
*  None of that has anything to do with policy or differences of political opinion. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=520.78s)]
*  It is, how do I hurt you the most? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=524.1s)]
*  And for Musk, it is his value, it is his share prices, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=526.94s)]
*  it is tens of billions of dollars in government funds flowing into his companies. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=530.78s)]
*  And for Musk, going back at Trump, you're in the Epstein documents. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=536.82s)]
*  Neither of those two things come from people, or [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=542.02s)]
*  neither of those are positions from people who mean well in this argument. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=545.3s)]
*  So I hope they continue. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=550.02s)]
*  I hope they continue fighting because it fractures the right and [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=553.1800000000001s)]
*  then also sets up an environment for the midterms where [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=556.46s)]
*  Elon Musk out of spite funds primary challengers and [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=560.3399999999999s)]
*  weakens Republicans going into the general. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=563.62s)]
*  So I'm all for it. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=566.2199999999999s)]
*  I hope they continue fighting. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=567.0999999999999s)]
*  Before we move on, Cenk, anything else you want to add? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=568.38s)]
*  Yeah, real quick couple things. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=570.62s)]
*  So first of all, I said I'm not in favor of the cuts. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=571.8199999999999s)]
*  I want to be clear. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=573.9s)]
*  I would be in favor of cuts to the Pentagon and [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=575.3s)]
*  to all the corporate subsidies that we give for no reason at all. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=577.54s)]
*  I'll never understand why the American taxpayer has to [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=581.8599999999999s)]
*  subsidize some of the richest corporations in the world. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=585.4599999999999s)]
*  I think in terms of how it's going to go from now on, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=588.7s)]
*  certainly the early indications are very, very bad. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=592.34s)]
*  Because Laura Ingraham was on the air yesterday and [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=596.34s)]
*  I think it was with Charlie Kirk. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=599.34s)]
*  And he said, things might be fine, etc. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=601.34s)]
*  And then Laura Ingraham was like, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=603.74s)]
*  my sources are telling me that the damage is, quote, irreparable, right? [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=605.38s)]
*  And so here's one more thing that if they cut it, then that cord [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=609.58s)]
*  between Trump and Musk becomes more irreparable. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=614.7s)]
*  If Donald Trump follows through on his promise of cutting not just Elon Musk [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=617.98s)]
*  subsidies, but the contracts he has with the government. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=622.9s)]
*  Well, then we're going to have a huge, huge war that continues for [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=627.22s)]
*  a long time. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=631.34s)]
*  And I don't know how that war ends. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=633.02s)]
*  And by the way, the most important part of this might be a thing that nobody's [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=634.3000000000001s)]
*  talking about, which is Golden Dome. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=637.54s)]
*  So Elon Musk was trying to get hundreds of billions of dollars for [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=639.58s)]
*  his companies through that nonsense Golden Dome project. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=643.54s)]
*  Now, if he cost himself that by doing these attacks, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=647.66s)]
*  Jackson might be right that Elon's will get hurt a lot more than Trump in [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=651.5799999999999s)]
*  the long run. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=656.5s)]
*  But having some significant portion of his base question him is a first for [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=657.54s)]
*  Trump. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=662.74s)]
*  It's not that, as I've been saying all along, in this second term took a lot of [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=663.3s)]
*  flack for it, but as you can see, it turned out to be true. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=668.42s)]
*  That no, a lot of people will disagree with Trump going forward. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=673.3s)]
*  Even I didn't expect this kind of spectacular disagreement in World War [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=677.3399999999999s)]
*  Three this early, right? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=682.3399999999999s)]
*  But yeah, they were willing to disagree. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=684.5799999999999s)]
*  But since this is World War Three, this is not, my God, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=686.78s)]
*  Tucker Carlson and Mark Levin are fighting. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=689.8199999999999s)]
*  And hey, somebody's disagreeing with Trump here and there. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=692.5s)]
*  This is a giant break in MAGA, and that can't be good for Trump either. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=695.6999999999999s)]
*  And then finally, it's tough to come back from that Epstein document line. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=702.42s)]
*  It's super tough, right? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=710.26s)]
*  Because, and I think that Elon probably since he's a child, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=712.3s)]
*  couldn't wait to use that line, right? [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=716.62s)]
*  He was probably boiling over on not getting the electric vehicle subsidies [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=719.9399999999999s)]
*  this whole time and a couple other things that he wanted, the NASA administrator, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=724.78s)]
*  etc, right? [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=728.38s)]
*  And he was getting angrier and angrier. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=729.66s)]
*  And these two can't contain themselves. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=732.02s)]
*  So I guarantee you he had it in his mind for weeks. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=734.22s)]
*  I can't wait to tweet about Epstein if he messes with me enough. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=737.62s)]
*  And so then he does, but then oops, that bridge might be so [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=741.14s)]
*  burned that it just doesn't exist anymore. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=746.22s)]
*  So we'll see. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=750.98s)]
*  And look, to Jordan's point on where do we fall out on this, for me, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=753.74s)]
*  it's always about policy. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=758.62s)]
*  So if it kills the bill that was going to put another at least $2.4 trillion on [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=761.1s)]
*  the debt and give the rich at least another $1.7 trillion for no reason. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=765.66s)]
*  That's just people making about 500,000, let alone all the other goodies in there. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=770.94s)]
*  And if it ends that, and it's a lot of other bad things in that bill, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=774.98s)]
*  then I'm thrilled about it. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=779.0600000000001s)]
*  And let's hope it keeps going, but it probably won't. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=781.02s)]
*  They'll probably repair at least the bill portion and go forward. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=783.26s)]
*  But even if it weakens them, so far, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=786.42s)]
*  haven't been exactly thrilled with how they're going. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=788.62s)]
*  So, Doge, look, Doge said they were going to cut defense, they didn't. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=792.86s)]
*  Doge said they were going to cut 2 trillion. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=797.3s)]
*  Of course, that was comical, Jackson's right, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=798.78s)]
*  that was never going to happen. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=800.38s)]
*  So they claim they cut 140 billion. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=801.78s)]
*  Later in the show, we're going to show you, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=803.54s)]
*  they're actually adding a lot of those jobs back because they cut it in a way [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=804.9399999999999s)]
*  that was maniacal and made no sense. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=807.66s)]
*  So they've done almost no good so far and a lot of damage. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=809.82s)]
*  So if this mitigates their ability to do damage, great, super last thing on it is, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=814.9399999999999s)]
*  on the other hand, if it brings Steve Bannon back into more power, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=819.78s)]
*  that's a giant mixed bag too because Bannon says, hey, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZeCg0ZVgs&t=823.8199999999999s)]
