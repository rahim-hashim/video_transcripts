**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [May 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0)
*  I'm going to be back. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=0.0s)]

*  Are we going to have a good show [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=22.0s)]
*  today? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=24.0s)]
*  Again, I don't know if you're [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=25.0s)]
*  crazy or not asking me questions [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=27.0s)]
*  today. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=29.0s)]
*  Okay, we've got the Trump [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=30.0s)]
*  administration falling apart at [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=31.0s)]
*  the seams, caught him in a bunch [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=33.0s)]
*  of lies, you're going to love that. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=35.0s)]
*  That's fun for everybody, except [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=37.0s)]
*  American people. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=39.0s)]
*  Are they really populous or not? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=40.0s)]
*  We caught him on that too. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=41.0s)]
*  So we got a story about what are [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=42.0s)]
*  they going to do to cut from [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=43.0s)]
*  the average guy? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=44.0s)]
*  And they claim they're going to [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=45.0s)]
*  give tax cuts to the average guy. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=47.0s)]
*  Is that right? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=48.0s)]
*  We'll talk about it. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=49.0s)]
*  Later in the program, men cutting [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=50.0s)]
*  their eyelashes so [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=52.0s)]
*  they look more masculine. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=53.0s)]
*  Good idea or bad idea? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=55.0s)]
*  Okay, we'll talk about that a [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=58.0s)]
*  little bit later. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=59.0s)]
*  And speaking of good idea or [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=60.0s)]
*  bad idea, Marjorie Taylor Greene [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=61.0s)]
*  on The Young Turks tonight. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=65.0s)]
*  What on God's green earth is [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=67.0s)]
*  happening? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=69.0s)]
*  Get it, God's green earth? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=70.0s)]
*  Okay, so that's at 8 o'clock [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=71.0s)]
*  Eastern, that's for everybody. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=73.0s)]
*  Make sure you stick around and [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=74.0s)]
*  check that out. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=75.0s)]
*  We're going to have a conversation [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=76.0s)]
*  about foreign policy, Iran, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=78.0s)]
*  Israel, freedom of speech. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=79.0s)]
*  In fact, we're asking you guys, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=81.0s)]
*  I mean, it's too late, but [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=83.0s)]
*  it's still fun for everybody. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=84.0s)]
*  We asked about Steve Bannon, but [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=85.0s)]
*  didn't have money, even though you [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=87.0s)]
*  guys had to do it. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=89.0s)]
*  But this was open to everyone, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=90.0s)]
*  not just members. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=92.0s)]
*  At tyt.com, we're asking, should [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=93.0s)]
*  we have Marjorie Taylor Greene on [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=95.0s)]
*  The Young Turks, okay? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=97.0s)]
*  So, and then when we get to the [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=98.0s)]
*  interview, I might quote the poll [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=100.0s)]
*  and ask her, look at that, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=102.0s)]
*  a lot of people saying yes already. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=104.0s)]
*  Lots of folks, okay. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=106.0s)]
*  So we'll give the results to her [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=108.0s)]
*  maybe in the interview at 8 o'clock [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=110.0s)]
*  tonight. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=112.0s)]
*  Okay, so, yes, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=113.0s)]
*  what do you got for us? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=114.0s)]
*  How you doing? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=115.0s)]
*  I'm doing very well. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=116.0s)]
*  We do have a lot of stories to get [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=117.0s)]
*  to. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=119.0s)]
*  I think producer Taylor was [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=120.0s)]
*  feeling very ambitious tonight. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=122.0s)]
*  So let's get right into the first [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=124.0s)]
*  story, lots to talk about. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=126.0s)]
*  There are 18 very important trading [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=128.0s)]
*  relationships. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=131.0s)]
*  We are currently negotiating with [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=133.0s)]
*  17 of those trading partners. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=136.0s)]
*  China, we have not engaged in [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=139.0s)]
*  negotiations with as of yet. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=141.0s)]
*  So today, Treasury Secretary Scott [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=143.0s)]
*  Bessent admitted in a congressional [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=145.0s)]
*  hearing that the United States and [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=147.0s)]
*  China are not actually engaged in [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=149.0s)]
*  any kind of trade negotiations. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=151.0s)]
*  And that might be a little bit [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=153.0s)]
*  surprising to some of you because [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=155.0s)]
*  Trump has been suggesting that that [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=157.0s)]
*  is exactly what has been happening. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=159.0s)]
*  And we will show you those receipts [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=161.0s)]
*  in just a little bit. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=163.0s)]
*  But Cenk, did you expect that [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=164.0s)]
*  negotiations with China were going [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=166.0s)]
*  to take this long to get off the [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=168.0s)]
*  ground? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=170.0s)]
*  Because we've been hearing since [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=171.0s)]
*  he first launched into these [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=173.0s)]
*  tariffs and caught all of that [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=175.0s)]
*  immediate backlash that don't [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=177.0s)]
*  worry, they're banging down my [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=179.0s)]
*  door trying to negotiate with me. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=181.0s)]
*  Yeah, okay, so there's two parts of [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=183.0s)]
*  the story. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=185.0s)]
*  One is the hilarious lies that they [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=186.0s)]
*  were caught in. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=188.0s)]
*  We're in the middle of negotiations, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=189.0s)]
*  it's happening, right? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=191.0s)]
*  Okay, didn't even talk to them [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=192.0s)]
*  once, okay? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=193.0s)]
*  So we'll get some of the receipts on [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=194.0s)]
*  that in a second. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=196.0s)]
*  And then the second part of the [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=197.0s)]
*  Wait, are these tariffs really [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=199.0s)]
*  going to stay around? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=201.0s)]
*  Because now some Trump supporters [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=202.0s)]
*  are like, I'm her dog, don't ask me [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=204.0s)]
*  if I'm all right. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=206.0s)]
*  And does he have a plan? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=207.0s)]
*  You know what the answer to that [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=209.0s)]
*  is. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=211.0s)]
*  So let's air it all out, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=212.0s)]
*  let's see the Republicans who are [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=213.0s)]
*  starting to panic and whether they [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=215.0s)]
*  actually are negotiating or not. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=217.0s)]
*  So yes, give us the details. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=219.0s)]
*  Yeah, so there has been some [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=221.0s)]
*  debate as to whether or not the United [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=223.0s)]
*  States and China are actually [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=225.0s)]
*  having these talks that Trump has [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=227.0s)]
*  been trumping, toting about for [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=229.0s)]
*  a while. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=231.0s)]
*  So here's reporting from [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=231.5s)]
*  the New York Times. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=233.0s)]
*  It says, in an interview with Time, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=234.0s)]
*  Trump said Xi had called him, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=236.0s)]
*  though he declined to say when, and [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=238.0s)]
*  asserted that his team was in active [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=240.0s)]
*  talks with China on a trade deal. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=242.0s)]
*  Asked about the interview outside [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=244.0s)]
*  the White House. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=246.0s)]
*  The President reiterated that he [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=247.0s)]
*  had spoken with the Chinese [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=249.0s)]
*  President numerous times, but [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=251.0s)]
*  he refused to answer when pressed [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=253.0s)]
*  that the call had happened after [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=255.0s)]
*  he imposed tariffs this month. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=257.0s)]
*  So when Trump asked about [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=259.0s)]
*  negotiation today, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=260.0s)]
*  things sounded a little bit [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=261.0s)]
*  different, take a look. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=262.0s)]
*  The program is from your capital [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=263.0s)]
*  bill, Secretary Vest said that [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=265.0s)]
*  there have been no negotiations [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=267.0s)]
*  yet with China. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=269.0s)]
*  You have said something different. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=270.0s)]
*  They want to meet, but [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=272.0s)]
*  they want to negotiate and [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=273.0s)]
*  they want to have a meeting and [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=274.0s)]
*  we'll be meeting with them at [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=275.0s)]
*  the right time. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=276.0s)]
*  But you haven't met with them yet? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=277.0s)]
*  I have not met with them. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=279.0s)]
*  Well, you know what Trump has [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=281.0s)]
*  says we're playing the long game [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=284.0s)]
*  here, right? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=286.0s)]
*  And we got to deal with the short [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=287.0s)]
*  term pain for the long term gain. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=289.0s)]
*  And he is insisting that even if [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=291.0s)]
*  trade completely stops between the [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=293.0s)]
*  United States and China, it will be [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=295.0s)]
*  a net positive. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=297.0s)]
*  So look at that. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=298.0s)]
*  And by not trading, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=299.0s)]
*  we're losing nothing. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=301.0s)]
*  So we saving a trillion dollars, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=303.0s)]
*  it's a lot. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=305.0s)]
*  We're losing more than $5 billion [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=306.0s)]
*  a day, $5 billion a day. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=309.0s)]
*  $5 billion a day, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=312.0s)]
*  you don't talk about that. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=313.0s)]
*  And right now we're going to be at [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=315.0s)]
*  a point very soon where we're [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=317.0s)]
*  making money every day. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=319.0s)]
*  Look, we were losing hundreds of [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=321.0s)]
*  billions of dollars with China. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=324.0s)]
*  Now we're essentially not doing [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=327.0s)]
*  business with China. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=329.0s)]
*  Therefore, we're saving hundreds of [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=330.0s)]
*  billions of dollars, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=332.0s)]
*  very simple. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=333.0s)]
*  Is it that simple? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=336.0s)]
*  Also, why does he speak that way? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=337.0s)]
*  He's very hard to listen to. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=339.0s)]
*  But okay, but [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=340.0s)]
*  let's take a look at what the [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=341.0s)]
*  actual implications of these [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=343.0s)]
*  tariffs are. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=345.0s)]
*  This is from CNN. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=346.0s)]
*  So ships now pulling into US [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=347.0s)]
*  harbors from China are the first to [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=349.0s)]
*  be subject to the massive tariffs [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=351.0s)]
*  that America is imposing on most [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=353.0s)]
*  Chinese imports. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=355.0s)]
*  Many of them are half full. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=356.0s)]
*  That means in a matter of weeks, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=358.0s)]
*  consumers will face higher prices [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=360.0s)]
*  and shortages of certain items. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=362.0s)]
*  So yeah, a lot of people are saying [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=364.0s)]
*  all these prices are supposed to [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=366.0s)]
*  spike, I'm not seeing it. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=368.0s)]
*  It's going to be a little bit of [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=370.0s)]
*  a delayed reaction and that delay [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=371.0s)]
*  seems to be catching up with us [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=372.0s)]
*  very shortly. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=373.0s)]
*  So in the meantime, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=374.0s)]
*  Americans are continuing to buy [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=375.0s)]
*  goods that were previously [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=377.0s)]
*  warehouse in the United States. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=378.0s)]
*  But those stockpiles are starting [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=380.0s)]
*  to run out. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=382.0s)]
*  Imports to the United States [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=383.0s)]
*  during the second half of 2025 are [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=385.0s)]
*  expected to fall at least 20% year [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=387.0s)]
*  over year, according to the [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=389.0s)]
*  National Retail Federation. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=391.0s)]
*  The decline from China will be [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=393.0s)]
*  even starker. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=395.0s)]
*  JP Morgan expects a 75 to 80% [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=396.0s)]
*  drop in imports from there. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=398.0s)]
*  Yesterday, a Trump supporting owner [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=400.0s)]
*  of a clothing store actually begged [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=402.0s)]
*  the president to help out small [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=404.0s)]
*  businesses just like his. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=406.0s)]
*  Take a look at this. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=408.0s)]
*  President Trump, as a longtime [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=410.0s)]
*  supporter of your mission and to [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=412.0s)]
*  make America great again, I want [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=414.0s)]
*  to be a part of that with you. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=416.0s)]
*  But we need e-commerce companies [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=418.0s)]
*  all across the United States. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=420.0s)]
*  We need more time. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=422.0s)]
*  Give us a 90 day off ramp to get [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=423.0s)]
*  off of our economy and [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=425.0s)]
*  get off ramp to get off of our [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=426.0s)]
*  China goods and just tell us the [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=428.0s)]
*  plan. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=430.0s)]
*  If you tell us the plan, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=430.5s)]
*  we can operate and [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=432.0s)]
*  we can know what to do. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=433.0s)]
*  The hard part about everything [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=434.0s)]
*  that's happening right now is we're [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=435.0s)]
*  trying to manage our business from [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=437.0s)]
*  day to day and [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=439.0s)]
*  that's very difficult. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=440.0s)]
*  And a lot of small businesses, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=441.0s)]
*  they don't have the cash flow to [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=443.0s)]
*  get through a 90 day negotiation. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=445.0s)]
*  And it's going to devastate a lot [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=447.0s)]
*  of businesses like cuts. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=449.0s)]
*  I'm in a group chat with a billion [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=451.0s)]
*  dollars worth of small businesses [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=453.0s)]
*  and I have several in there that [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=455.0s)]
*  are telling me, hey, Stephen, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=457.0s)]
*  30 days or 60 days, we might not [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=459.0s)]
*  be able to make it. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=461.0s)]
*  There's been too many adjustments [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=462.0s)]
*  to the supply chain that are just [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=464.0s)]
*  being really devastating on [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=466.0s)]
*  our business. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=468.0s)]
*  145% is essentially an embargo and [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=469.0s)]
*  by cutting off our products to be [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=471.0s)]
*  able to sell them, it's going to [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=473.0s)]
*  be really difficult. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=475.0s)]
*  It's almost a little bit sad to [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=476.0s)]
*  watch him. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=478.0s)]
*  I can't tell if I feel bad for him [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=479.0s)]
*  because he said that he's been [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=481.0s)]
*  a longtime supporter of Trump and [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=483.0s)]
*  of MAGA, but I don't know what he [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=485.0s)]
*  expected was going to happen. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=487.0s)]
*  Also, I've said it before for [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=489.0s)]
*  presidential administration to [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=491.0s)]
*  enact all these widespread tariffs [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=493.0s)]
*  right on an entire population, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=495.0s)]
*  not just here in the United States [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=497.0s)]
*  but around the world. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=499.0s)]
*  You can't just do something without [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=500.0s)]
*  having some kind of contingencies [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=502.0s)]
*  in place, some ways that are going [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=504.0s)]
*  to support the populace, the people [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=506.0s)]
*  who are going to be most affected [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=508.0s)]
*  by it. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=510.0s)]
*  All of this feels very slashed, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=511.0s)]
*  it feels very slapdash and [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=512.0s)]
*  very irresponsibly laid out. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=513.0s)]
*  They just did it and said whatever [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=516.0s)]
*  happens happens, and they didn't [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=517.0s)]
*  seem to have any considerations [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=518.0s)]
*  for the business owners or just [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=519.0s)]
*  the regular average people who are [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=520.0s)]
*  going to be the most negatively [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=522.0s)]
*  impacted by all these terrorists. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=524.0s)]
*  And that's really just most of [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=526.0s)]
*  Americans whenever you consider [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=528.0s)]
*  that we're all going to see the [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=530.0s)]
*  prices of the grocery stores going [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=532.0s)]
*  up if they haven't happened already [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=534.0s)]
*  very, very soon. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=536.0s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=537.0s)]
*  I mean, this is obviously very [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=557.0s)]
*  disingenuous coming from the Trump [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=558.0s)]
*  administration. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=560.0s)]
*  But where do you think we're [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=561.0s)]
*  headed with all of this? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=562.0s)]
*  What are your thoughts generally [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=563.0s)]
*  about these terrorists now that [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=565.0s)]
*  things that what do they say the [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=567.0s)]
*  roosters are going to come home to [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=569.0s)]
*  roost? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=571.0s)]
*  That's not it. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=572.0s)]
*  But you know. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=573.0s)]
*  So, okay, so let's dive into it. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=574.0s)]
*  First Trump then this brother from [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=576.0s)]
*  cuts, because I think he's a [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=578.0s)]
*  really interesting example. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=580.0s)]
*  So I want to walk you through how [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=582.0s)]
*  his business is going to get [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=584.0s)]
*  affected because it's going to [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=586.0s)]
*  affect so many other businesses [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=588.0s)]
*  and the entire economy. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=590.0s)]
*  So first on Trump, he says, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=592.0s)]
*  China's been calling me. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=594.0s)]
*  No, they haven't. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=596.0s)]
*  They put out a statement saying, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=597.0s)]
*  no, seriously, we haven't called [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=598.0s)]
*  Trump at all. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=600.0s)]
*  And we have no interest in calling [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=601.0s)]
*  Trump. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=603.0s)]
*  And so they keep saying, no, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=604.0s)]
*  it's okay. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=605.0s)]
*  We're winning this one. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=606.0s)]
*  China thinks, brother, we got a [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=607.0s)]
*  100 year plan. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=609.0s)]
*  You're going to be out of office [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=610.0s)]
*  in three and a half years. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=612.0s)]
*  I mean, even if the tariffs lasted [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=613.0s)]
*  that long, which there's no way in [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=614.0s)]
*  the world that they will have added [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=615.0s)]
*  haus because what the Chinese are [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=617.0s)]
*  saying are saying and thinking is [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=619.0s)]
*  we thought this was going to be [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=621.0s)]
*  a big deal. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=623.0s)]
*  We thought this through and [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=624.0s)]
*  I bet you haven't. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=625.0s)]
*  And I bet you're not ready to [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=626.0s)]
*  brace for impact and have all the [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=628.0s)]
*  different economic consequences [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=630.0s)]
*  hit the US and brush it off. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=632.0s)]
*  And I think that the Chinese are [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=634.0s)]
*  unfortunately correct. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=636.0s)]
*  Trump has not thought it through [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=637.0s)]
*  as his supporter there is being to [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=639.0s)]
*  figure it out. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=641.0s)]
*  It is going to be very painful. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=642.0s)]
*  We are not going to be able to [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=644.0s)]
*  withstand the pain. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=645.0s)]
*  And so then he'll have done damage [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=646.0s)]
*  not just to the economy but to the [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=648.0s)]
*  cause of tariffs. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=650.0s)]
*  And even reciprocal tariffs with [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=651.0s)]
*  China, which we should have done [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=652.0s)]
*  a long time ago. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=654.0s)]
*  Reciprocal is, hey, you do 10%, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=655.0s)]
*  I do 10%. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=657.0s)]
*  Now you do 10%, I do 145%. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=658.0s)]
*  because when you do 145%, as a lot [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=661.0s)]
*  of these folks are saying and that [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=663.0s)]
*  businessman said it as well in a [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=665.0s)]
*  long version of the interview, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=667.0s)]
*  145% is an embargo. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=669.0s)]
*  That's not a thing you could do. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=670.0s)]
*  So let's say that he's selling [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=672.0s)]
*  a shirt and let's say it's a high [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=674.0s)]
*  end shirt, it's $100, right? [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=676.0s)]
*  And normally he gets it from China [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=678.0s)]
*  for make up a number here, $50, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=680.0s)]
*  right? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=682.0s)]
*  Okay, 145% tariffs. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=683.0s)]
*  All of a sudden, that shirt's [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=685.0s)]
*  cost to him is near $125. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=688.0s)]
*  But he's selling it for 100, so [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=694.0s)]
*  it doesn't make any sense. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=695.0s)]
*  Well, he has to double it because [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=697.0s)]
*  that's usually how it works in [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=699.0s)]
*  retail. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=701.0s)]
*  So now the shirt he was selling [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=702.0s)]
*  for 100, he's got to sell for 250? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=703.0s)]
*  Well, nobody's going to buy that [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=706.0s)]
*  shirt. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=707.0s)]
*  So that's an embargo. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=708.0s)]
*  That's not a tariff, right? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=709.0s)]
*  So now if you believe in tariffs [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=711.0s)]
*  that are reciprocal or targeted [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=713.0s)]
*  towards specific manufacturing [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=715.0s)]
*  base, we're all screwed. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=717.0s)]
*  That's never going to happen after [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=719.0s)]
*  Trump because the idea of tariffs [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=721.0s)]
*  is going to be so poisoned after [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=723.0s)]
*  all this, after it crashes the [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=725.0s)]
*  economy, which is the next part [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=727.0s)]
*  that I'm super curious about. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=729.0s)]
*  Because I feel like either I'm [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=731.0s)]
*  missing something or the rest of [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=733.0s)]
*  the country is missing something. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=735.0s)]
*  Because we buy an extraordinary [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=737.0s)]
*  amount of stuff from China, and [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=740.0s)]
*  they're all going to be in essence [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=743.0s)]
*  embargoed, I don't think we [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=746.0s)]
*  realize the iceberg we're about [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=749.0s)]
*  to hit. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=751.0s)]
*  Everybody's like, there's a little [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=752.0s)]
*  bit of panic in the business world. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=754.0s)]
*  For small businesses, they're [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=756.0s)]
*  bigger panic, affected industries [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=758.0s)]
*  bigger panic. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=760.0s)]
*  But the stock market I'm shocked [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=761.0s)]
*  is not cratering soon. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=764.0s)]
*  I think there's going to be tons [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=767.0s)]
*  and tons of empty shelves or [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=769.0s)]
*  products that are so expensive [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=771.0s)]
*  that they're totally unbuyable. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=773.0s)]
*  So that's not a small amount of [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=775.0s)]
*  stuff that we buy from China. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=777.0s)]
*  All right, let's see how it turns [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=779.0s)]
*  out because my sense is this will [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=781.0s)]
*  be way more catastrophic than [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=783.0s)]
*  people realize. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=785.0s)]
*  But the brother from cuts is [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=786.0s)]
*  beginning to realize how [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=787.0s)]
*  catastrophic it is to his [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=788.0s)]
*  business. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=789.0s)]
*  So let me go back to that example [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=790.0s)]
*  for a second. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=791.0s)]
*  So why is he asking for 90 days? [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=792.0s)]
*  Because he's like, look, if I'm [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=794.0s)]
*  going to buy from China, all of [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=796.0s)]
*  a sudden the $50 shirt is $125, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=797.0s)]
*  I can't do it. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=799.0s)]
*  So and then when Jake Tapper asked [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=800.0s)]
*  him about, well, why don't you [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=802.0s)]
*  just buy from America? [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=804.0s)]
*  He's like, we have been doing that [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=805.0s)]
*  in so long, textiles. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=807.0s)]
*  In fact, not only are we more [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=808.0s)]
*  expensive in America, but [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=810.0s)]
*  unfortunately our quality has gone [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=812.0s)]
*  backwards. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=814.0s)]
*  And China and other places are very [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=815.0s)]
*  high texture, their quality has [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=817.0s)]
*  gone up. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=819.0s)]
*  This is not my words, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=820.0s)]
*  that's his words, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=821.0s)]
*  he's a Trump supporter, okay? [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=822.0s)]
*  He's got to go buy from somewhere [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=823.0s)]
*  else. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=825.0s)]
*  So he's got to go figure out, hey, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=825.5s)]
*  is there a price I could afford [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=828.0s)]
*  from Sweden or Cambodia? [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=830.0s)]
*  I don't know any country that [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=832.0s)]
*  doesn't have 145% tariff. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=834.0s)]
*  So he's in a panic right now, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=837.0s)]
*  because if he can't, then no one's [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=839.0s)]
*  going to buy his shirts and he's [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=841.0s)]
*  going to go broke. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=843.0s)]
*  Not in two years from now, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=844.0s)]
*  in two months from now. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=846.0s)]
*  And what happens if that happens on [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=849.0s)]
*  a mass scale, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=851.0s)]
*  I kind of think probably will [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=852.0s)]
*  happen very soon. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=854.0s)]
*  You think we can withstand that? [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=855.0s)]
*  No, people are going to be super [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=857.0s)]
*  angry. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=859.0s)]
*  Hey, Trump, he's a flip flopper, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=860.0s)]
*  he doesn't know anything. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=862.0s)]
*  He throws things up against the [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=864.0s)]
*  wall and see if it sticks. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=865.0s)]
*  And this ain't going to stick. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=866.0s)]
*  So he's going to flip flop, but [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=868.0s)]
*  there are a ton of damage is going [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=869.0s)]
*  to be done. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=870.0s)]
*  One more thing here, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=871.0s)]
*  it's interesting, actually two more [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=872.0s)]
*  things, because even his own [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=874.0s)]
*  supporters, that brother voted for [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=876.0s)]
*  him, even though Trump talked [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=878.0s)]
*  about tariffs. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=880.0s)]
*  There's a lot of things he didn't [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=881.0s)]
*  talk about. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=882.0s)]
*  He didn't say, I'm not going to [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=882.5s)]
*  follow due process. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=884.0s)]
*  So if you elect me, I'm going to [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=885.0s)]
*  tear up the Constitution. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=886.0s)]
*  I think he indicated that he hated [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=887.0s)]
*  the Constitution, didn't care about [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=889.0s)]
*  it, and wanted to terminate it. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=891.0s)]
*  He even, in fact, said it once. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=892.0s)]
*  But I couldn't get anyone to [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=893.0s)]
*  believe me, right? [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=894.0s)]
*  I couldn't get anyone to focus on [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=895.0s)]
*  how much he hates the Constitution [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=896.0s)]
*  and doesn't care. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=898.0s)]
*  He just wants to be [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=899.0s)]
*  an authoritarian leader. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=900.0s)]
*  But what's interesting is that his [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=901.0s)]
*  own voters and supporters, even on [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=903.0s)]
*  things he did say, like, I'm going [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=905.0s)]
*  to tariff the hell out of people, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=907.0s)]
*  they didn't really believe him. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=909.0s)]
*  Since he lies so much and trolls so [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=911.0s)]
*  much and just says such nonsensical [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=913.0s)]
*  things, they just started doing [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=915.0s)]
*  wish fulfillment, right? [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=917.0s)]
*  Like putting their wishes onto [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=919.0s)]
*  Trump, not really listening to [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=921.0s)]
*  what he's saying, because three [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=923.0s)]
*  quarters of what he says isn't [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=925.0s)]
*  true. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=927.0s)]
*  They're come to find out he [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=928.0s)]
*  actually did mean it about tariffs. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=929.0s)]
*  And they're like, what the hell? [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=931.0s)]
*  I didn't know you really meant it. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=932.0s)]
*  That'll totally destroy my [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=934.0s)]
*  business. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=935.0s)]
*  If he knew about this earlier, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=936.0s)]
*  would he have voted for Trump? [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=937.0s)]
*  I mean, unless he's an idiot and [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=938.0s)]
*  doesn't like his business and [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=939.0s)]
*  would like to go broke, [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=940.0s)]
*  he probably wouldn't have, right? [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=941.0s)]
*  So the fact that he's such [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=943.0s)]
*  an enormous liar and that his own [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=945.0s)]
*  voters don't believe him is such [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=947.0s)]
*  an interesting phenomenon, which [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=949.0s)]
*  leads us back to the original lie [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=951.0s)]
*  that you saw in that clip. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=953.0s)]
*  We're losing 5 million a day, and [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=955.0s)]
*  if we stop it, we start gaining [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=957.0s)]
*  money. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=959.0s)]
*  No, we don't. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=960.0s)]
*  That's not how it works. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=961.0s)]
*  So we're not losing money. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=962.0s)]
*  They're sending money to Trump. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=965.0s)]
*  They're sending in products here. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=967.0s)]
*  We pay for them and [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=969.0s)]
*  we pay a cheaper price than we [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=970.0s)]
*  would from anywhere else. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=971.0s)]
*  And then we sell those products. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=972.0s)]
*  So if you take a tariff and those [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=974.0s)]
*  products are actually bought, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=976.0s)]
*  which they're not going to be [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=978.0s)]
*  because they're too higher price, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=979.0s)]
*  then we would take money from [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=981.0s)]
*  a tariff, but we're not even going [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=982.0s)]
*  to get that because it's essentially [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=983.0s)]
*  an embargo. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=985.0s)]
*  So all that's going to happen is [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=986.0s)]
*  the trade's going to stop. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=988.0s)]
*  So once the trade stops and [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=989.0s)]
*  we don't get any imports from [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=991.0s)]
*  China, do we then magically make [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=993.0s)]
*  money? [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=995.0s)]
*  No, no, we don't. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=996.0s)]
*  He has no idea what he's talking [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=997.0s)]
*  about. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=999.0s)]
*  He never does. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1000.0s)]
*  Look guys, we showed you the clip [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1001.0s)]
*  the other day. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1002.0s)]
*  He doesn't even know what the [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1003.0s)]
*  Declaration of Independence is. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1004.0s)]
*  He's still about unity and [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1005.0s)]
*  love and respect. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1006.0s)]
*  No, it's not. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1007.0s)]
*  It's the opposite of unity. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1008.0s)]
*  It's declaring independence. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1010.0s)]
*  Couldn't be more the opposite, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1012.0s)]
*  right? [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1013.0s)]
*  We love the British Empire. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1014.0s)]
*  No, we don't. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1015.0s)]
*  That's why we declared war [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1016.0s)]
*  against them. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1017.0s)]
*  Okay, so he knows nothing. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1018.0s)]
*  You think that guy's going to [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1020.0s)]
*  handle a sophisticated economic [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1022.0s)]
*  policy? [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1024.0s)]
*  That's why when, I mean, I feel [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1025.0s)]
*  bad for the guy because he's [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1027.0s)]
*  probably about to go broke. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1028.0s)]
*  But when he's like, later in the [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1029.0s)]
*  interview, he's like, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1031.0s)]
*  what's the plan? [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1032.0s)]
*  Please just tell us the plan. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1033.0s)]
*  There is no plan, brother. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1035.0s)]
*  I hate to break it to you. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1036.0s)]
*  There is no plan. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1037.0s)]
*  There is no plan and there really [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1038.0s)]
*  doesn't seem as if there ever was [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1040.0s)]
*  a plan and Trump really feels like [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1042.0s)]
*  that isn't even his problem that [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1044.0s)]
*  he needs to provide some type of [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1046.0s)]
*  plan. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1048.0s)]
*  And I feel like I talk a lot about [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1049.0s)]
*  Trump's rhetoric because the way he [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1051.0s)]
*  speaks is very interesting to me. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1053.0s)]
*  The words that he chooses to use, [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1054.0s)]
*  the way that he chooses to describe [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1056.0s)]
*  things to his voters, right? [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1058.0s)]
*  He uses words like reciprocal [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1060.0s)]
*  tariffs to mean one thing when it [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1062.0s)]
*  really is not the reality. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1064.0s)]
*  He says things like it's 145% [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1066.0s)]
*  tariff when the reality is that it [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1068.0s)]
*  is more like an embargo. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1070.0s)]
*  So he says a lot of things without [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1072.0s)]
*  explaining it. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1074.0s)]
*  He almost changes the entire [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1075.0s)]
*  meaning of words, at least in [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1077.0s)]
*  the pop culture sense of politics, [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1079.0s)]
*  right? [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1081.0s)]
*  And I think a lot of that sort of [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1082.0s)]
*  serves to confuse people, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1083.0s)]
*  including the people who vote for [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1084.0s)]
*  him, including the people who hear [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1086.0s)]
*  the words that he says and [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1088.0s)]
*  really do believe him, right? [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1089.0s)]
*  They actually do think that the [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1090.0s)]
*  thing that he says, [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1092.0s)]
*  the thing that comes out of his [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1093.0s)]
*  mouth is, that's a fact, right? [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1095.0s)]
*  They really just even at this point [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1097.0s)]
*  at this stage in the game, [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1099.0s)]
*  ten years after having dealt with [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1100.0s)]
*  Trump for so long, [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1102.0s)]
*  they don't understand that the [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1103.0s)]
*  things he says is not necessarily [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1105.0s)]
*  reality. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1107.0s)]
*  And also as far as the business [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1108.0s)]
*  owners, I do feel bad for them [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1109.0s)]
*  because they're dealing with this [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1110.0s)]
*  constant instability. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1111.0s)]
*  I can't even make decisions for [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1112.0s)]
*  my own life, let alone my own [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1114.0s)]
*  business without wondering about [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1116.0s)]
*  what the country is going to look [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1118.0s)]
*  like a few months or [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1120.0s)]
*  a few years from now, right? [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1121.0s)]
*  It's very, very difficult for [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1123.0s)]
*  people to make big life decisions [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1124.0s)]
*  such as buying a house or even [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1126.0s)]
*  where to settle because even the [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1128.0s)]
*  job market is so unstable, right? [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1130.0s)]
*  My husband works in the tech [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1132.0s)]
*  industry kind of and he's, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1134.0s)]
*  Doge is just looming in the corner. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1136.0s)]
*  And it's very hard to move forward [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1139.0s)]
*  and now these business owners, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1140.0s)]
*  they're also experiencing their own [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1142.0s)]
*  version of that. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1144.0s)]
*  You can't make business decisions [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1145.0s)]
*  when a lot of the things that were [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1147.0s)]
*  in place that stabilize the economy [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1149.0s)]
*  and stabilize the marketplace are [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1151.0s)]
*  no longer in place. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1153.0s)]
*  Everything is up in flux right now. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1154.0s)]
*  So people are just trying to get [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1156.0s)]
*  by from month to month and that is [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1158.0s)]
*  not really a great way to run a [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1160.0s)]
*  business. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1162.0s)]
*  And we saw it during the pandemic, [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1163.0s)]
*  so many businesses, especially [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1165.0s)]
*  small businesses had to close down. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1167.0s)]
*  And in this country, especially [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1168.0s)]
*  during the Obama era, there was [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1170.0s)]
*  a lot of push for small businesses [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1172.0s)]
*  to spring up and open in this [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1174.0s)]
*  country. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1176.0s)]
*  Now we're seeing just the [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1177.0s)]
*  corporatists coming in and saying, [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1179.0s)]
*  we're going to scoop all this up. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1181.0s)]
*  And this is all ours now and we [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1183.0s)]
*  have these big mega monopolies and [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1185.0s)]
*  Congress is not doing anything to [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1187.0s)]
*  stop them so. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1189.0s)]
*  What was shared over signal then [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1190.0s)]
*  and now however you characterize it [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1193.0s)]
*  was informal unclassified [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1196.0s)]
*  coordinations for media [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1199.0s)]
*  coordination other things. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1202.0s)]
*  That's what we're seeing. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1205.0s)]
*  We're seeing a lot of people [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1207.0s)]
*  coming in and saying, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1209.0s)]
*  hey, we're going to do this. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1211.0s)]
*  We're going to do this. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1213.0s)]
*  We're going to do this. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1214.0s)]
*  We're going to do this. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1215.0s)]
*  We're going to do this. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1216.0s)]
*  We're going to do this. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1217.0s)]
*  For media coordination other [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1218.0s)]
*  things. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1219.0s)]
*  That's what I've said from [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1220.0s)]
*  the beginning. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1221.0s)]
*  At the beginning, it was left wing [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1222.0s)]
*  reporters from the Atlantic who got [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1224.0s)]
*  a hold of it and then wanted to [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1226.0s)]
*  create a problem for the president. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1227.0s)]
*  Got a hold of it is an interesting [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1229.0s)]
*  way to put that but that was [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1231.0s)]
*  Defense Secretary and former Fox [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1233.0s)]
*  News host Pete Hegseth defending [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1235.0s)]
*  the use of the messaging app [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1237.0s)]
*  signal in his official capacity and [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1239.0s)]
*  the work he's doing over the [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1241.0s)]
*  Pentagon. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1243.0s)]
*  However, this isn't a news story, [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1244.0s)]
*  but it turns out that the extent [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1246.0s)]
*  to which the app was used in the [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1248.0s)]
*  Pentagon is a lot more than what [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1250.0s)]
*  we previously thought. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1252.0s)]
*  Cenk, before we get into the [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1253.0s)]
*  details of this story, why is this [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1255.0s)]
*  an important story for the American [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1257.0s)]
*  people to care about? [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1259.0s)]
*  Turns out that you might not want [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1260.0s)]
*  to pick a weekend Fox and [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1262.0s)]
*  Friends host to be the Secretary [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1264.0s)]
*  of Defense. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1266.0s)]
*  If any story involves national [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1267.0s)]
*  security, it's this one and [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1269.0s)]
*  they're leaking like a sieve. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1271.0s)]
*  I want to play a little bit of [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1273.0s)]
*  I want to point out a massive [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1275.0s)]
*  hypocrisy a little bit later in [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1277.0s)]
*  this story, but mainly the question [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1279.0s)]
*  that this that arises for me and [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1281.0s)]
*  we'll dive into the details here or [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1283.0s)]
*  the deets as the kids say and see [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1285.0s)]
*  what it is because now I'm being [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1287.0s)]
*  to think maybe this isn't like [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1289.0s)]
*  America first or Israel back [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1291.0s)]
*  nations etc. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1293.0s)]
*  Just might be that Hegseth is like [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1294.0s)]
*  enormously incompetent. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1296.0s)]
*  Like there might be a really simple [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1298.0s)]
*  explanation, but let's hear the [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1300.0s)]
*  so-called deets and [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1302.0s)]
*  see what we decide. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1303.0s)]
*  I got the deeds, I have all of it [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1304.0s)]
*  for you, okay? [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1306.0s)]
*  So according to reporting from [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1307.0s)]
*  the Wall Street Journal, Hegseth [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1309.0s)]
*  had at least a dozen signal chats [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1311.0s)]
*  going many of which he started [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1313.0s)]
*  himself, even though the app has [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1315.0s)]
*  not been approved for discussing [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1317.0s)]
*  sensitive information. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1319.0s)]
*  So here's reporting from the Wall [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1320.0s)]
*  Street Journal. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1322.0s)]
*  In one case, he told AIDS on [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1323.0s)]
*  the encrypted app to inform [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1325.0s)]
*  foreign governments about an [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1327.0s)]
*  unfolding military operation, [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1329.0s)]
*  the people said. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1331.0s)]
*  He also used the non governmental [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1332.0s)]
*  message service to discuss media [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1334.0s)]
*  appearances, foreign travel, [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1336.0s)]
*  his schedule, and other unclassified [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1338.0s)]
*  but sensitive information to people [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1340.0s)]
*  said and the people that they keep [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1342.0s)]
*  referring to in the article, those [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1344.0s)]
*  are the journal sources. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1346.0s)]
*  Hegseth used the app to send [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1347.0s)]
*  messages both from an unsecured [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1349.0s)]
*  line in the Pentagon as well as [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1351.0s)]
*  from his personal phone. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1353.0s)]
*  And it turns out this was unknown [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1355.0s)]
*  before that some of the messages [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1357.0s)]
*  from Hegseth were actually sent by [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1359.0s)]
*  his military aid Marine Colonel [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1361.0s)]
*  Ricky Buria, who had access to [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1363.0s)]
*  Hegseth's personal phone. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1365.0s)]
*  For instance, it was actually [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1367.0s)]
*  Buria who sent messages on signal [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1369.0s)]
*  regarding the US attack on the [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1371.0s)]
*  Houthi militants in Yemen. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1373.0s)]
*  It was of course after a journalist [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1375.0s)]
*  from the Atlantic was added to this [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1377.0s)]
*  group that we all became privy to [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1379.0s)]
*  all of this knowledge, the story [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1381.0s)]
*  went viral and that led to an [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1383.0s)]
*  investigation at the Pentagon into [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1385.0s)]
*  operations under Hegseth. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1387.0s)]
*  In an attempt to get some kind of [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1389.0s)]
*  a fall guy, Hegseth was able to [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1391.0s)]
*  keep his job but National Security [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1393.0s)]
*  Advisor Mike Waltz did lose his job [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1395.0s)]
*  and this move was panned by a lot [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1397.0s)]
*  of people, but it was seen widely [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1399.0s)]
*  as a move on Trump's behalf because [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1401.0s)]
*  he wanted to keep Hegseth around, [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1403.0s)]
*  right? [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1405.0s)]
*  That's a Trump appointee, [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1405.5s)]
*  that is a Trump sycophant, [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1407.0s)]
*  he's going to do whatever it takes [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1408.5s)]
*  to push and promote Trump's agenda [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1410.0s)]
*  and to say whatever he wants to [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1412.0s)]
*  say to the people who are [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1414.0s)]
*  around him and to say whatever he [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1416.0s)]
*  needs to say. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1418.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, Mike Waltz not so much, [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1419.0s)]
*  Mike Waltz did not agree with [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1421.0s)]
*  Trump on everything 100% of the [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1422.5s)]
*  time and it seems like Trump was [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1424.0s)]
*  just happy for an excuse to get [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1425.5s)]
*  rid of a guy like that. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1427.0s)]
*  So here is more from the report. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1428.0s)]
*  Among the messages posted in some [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1431.0s)]
*  of the other chats by Hegseth were [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1433.0s)]
*  his thoughts on personnel matters, [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1435.0s)]
*  Pentagon programs facing cuts and [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1437.0s)]
*  details of administration national [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1439.0s)]
*  security debates. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1441.0s)]
*  The text authorizing aides to tell [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1442.0s)]
*  allies about military operations [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1444.0s)]
*  are among the most sensitive [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1446.0s)]
*  messages he sent. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1448.0s)]
*  Instead of using the Pentagon's [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1449.0s)]
*  vast communications network, [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1451.0s)]
*  Hegseth preferred signal to run [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1453.0s)]
*  the Defense Department's day to day [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1455.0s)]
*  operations, the people said. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1457.0s)]
*  Among those, he added to chats were [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1459.0s)]
*  members of his security detail, [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1461.0s)]
*  staffers in his personal office and [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1463.0s)]
*  that of the deputy secretary, as [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1465.0s)]
*  well as public affairs aides. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1467.0s)]
*  So there's a few obvious concerns [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1469.0s)]
*  with this, but [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1471.0s)]
*  there's a few obvious concerns [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1472.0s)]
*  with using this app for handling [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1474.0s)]
*  these very, very classified or [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1476.0s)]
*  at least sensitive information that [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1478.0s)]
*  is being passed and discussed in [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1480.0s)]
*  this app. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1482.0s)]
*  So for one, these apps are [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1483.0s)]
*  susceptible to hacking, so [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1484.0s)]
*  potentially a lot of what is being [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1485.0s)]
*  discussed in these apps could end [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1487.0s)]
*  up in the wrong hands or just in [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1489.0s)]
*  the hands of people who are not [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1491.0s)]
*  authorized to have this information [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1493.0s)]
*  which is most people, right, [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1495.0s)]
*  including Hegseth's wife and [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1497.0s)]
*  brother and the journalist from [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1499.0s)]
*  the press. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1501.0s)]
*  There are other concerns with [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1502.0s)]
*  the reporting, the official [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1504.0s)]
*  reporting of the content of the [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1506.0s)]
*  apps because some of Pete Hegseth's [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1508.0s)]
*  messages were deleted from the app [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1510.0s)]
*  or they disappeared before they [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1512.0s)]
*  could actually be added to the [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1514.0s)]
*  official record. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1516.0s)]
*  And more from the Wall Street [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1517.0s)]
*  Journal says DOD personnel won't [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1519.0s)]
*  use non-DOD accounts or personal [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1521.0s)]
*  email accounts, messaging systems [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1523.0s)]
*  or other non-public DOD information [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1525.0s)]
*  systems except approved or [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1527.0s)]
*  authorized government contractor [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1529.0s)]
*  systems to conduct official [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1531.0s)]
*  business. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1533.0s)]
*  So Cenk, I know you have a lot to [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1534.0s)]
*  say about this. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1536.0s)]
*  It is very concerning that the [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1537.0s)]
*  extent to which that this app has [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1539.0s)]
*  been used, even though it's not [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1541.0s)]
*  recommended for information that [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1543.0s)]
*  could be classified. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1545.0s)]
*  And the things that they're [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1546.0s)]
*  discussing on here are very, [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1548.0s)]
*  very high level information, [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1550.0s)]
*  very sensitive information [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1552.0s)]
*  regarding exact timing of military [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1554.0s)]
*  airplanes and missiles and [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1556.0s)]
*  things like that. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1558.0s)]
*  So it is kind of scary, not kind of, [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1559.0s)]
*  it is very scary as a matter of [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1561.0s)]
*  national security, which is funny [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1563.0s)]
*  because Trump likes to say that [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1565.0s)]
*  everything is an issue with [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1567.0s)]
*  national security. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1569.0s)]
*  But this one actually is and he [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1570.0s)]
*  seems to be brushing it under the [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1572.0s)]
*  rug all in an attempt to just [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1574.0s)]
*  protect Pete Hegseth. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1576.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's really a good point [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1578.0s)]
*  because later in the show, [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1580.0s)]
*  live 6AM Eastern every day, [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1582.0s)]
*  we're going to talk about how he's [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1584.0s)]
*  a national security threat. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1586.0s)]
*  Because it's a national security [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1587.0s)]
*  threat if they make movies out of [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1589.0s)]
*  Vancouver, is it? [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1591.0s)]
*  Is that a national security threat? [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1592.0s)]
*  You know what's a national security [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1594.0s)]
*  threat? [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1596.0s)]
*  Hey, here's who we're bombing in [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1597.0s)]
*  when we're bombing them and [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1599.0s)]
*  what methods we're using. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1601.0s)]
*  Oops, it's in an unsecured place. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1603.0s)]
*  That's an actual national security [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1605.0s)]
*  threat. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1607.0s)]
*  Movies out of Vancouver, [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1608.0s)]
*  not as much. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1609.0s)]
*  But so he doesn't care, but of [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1610.0s)]
*  course we all know this. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1611.0s)]
*  He doesn't care about any policy or [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1612.0s)]
*  anything that's real or [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1614.0s)]
*  national security. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1616.0s)]
*  He just cares about what things [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1618.0s)]
*  look like, right? [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1620.0s)]
*  Hegseth, he's out of [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1621.0s)]
*  central casting, I like him. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1622.0s)]
*  Vancouver, not out of central [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1624.0s)]
*  casting. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1625.0s)]
*  Hollywood out of central casting, [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1626.0s)]
*  Hollywood invented central [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1627.0s)]
*  casting. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1628.0s)]
*  We're going back there, right? [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1629.0s)]
*  We'll tell you later why he's [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1631.0s)]
*  obsessed with that and [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1632.0s)]
*  Alcatraz and stuff. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1633.0s)]
*  Okay, but back to this story. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1634.0s)]
*  So let's now note the hypocrisy. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1637.0s)]
*  Hillary's emails, [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1641.0s)]
*  I can't believe it was in [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1642.0s)]
*  an unsecured place. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1644.0s)]
*  Unsecured Hillary's emails. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1646.0s)]
*  It is the greatest violation of [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1650.0s)]
*  national security ever. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1652.0s)]
*  This is all non-secured. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1654.0s)]
*  And what's interesting is that they [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1657.0s)]
*  chose to do, I mean Hegseth is [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1659.0s)]
*  probably on TV crying about [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1661.0s)]
*  Hillary's emails about 2,000 times, [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1663.0s)]
*  right? [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1665.0s)]
*  And then he goes in, he becomes [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1666.0s)]
*  Secretary of Defense and he's like, [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1667.0s)]
*  let's see what Hillary did. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1669.0s)]
*  Let's just go totally [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1670.0s)]
*  unsecured right away. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1671.0s)]
*  Right away, don't even like, [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1672.0s)]
*  it was an accident or [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1674.0s)]
*  it happened later after I got [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1675.0s)]
*  burned by the people in [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1677.0s)]
*  the internal system and [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1678.0s)]
*  there was something went, no, no, [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1679.0s)]
*  no, he's like, [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1681.0s)]
*  let's go illegal right away. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1682.0s)]
*  And what's the illegal part? [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1683.0s)]
*  Number one, it's against the rules [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1685.0s)]
*  to go to unsecured app, right? [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1687.0s)]
*  But also number two, [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1690.0s)]
*  the more illegal thing, [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1692.0s)]
*  something can be more illegal. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1694.0s)]
*  Yeah, it could be a harsher [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1696.0s)]
*  sentence, etc. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1698.0s)]
*  Is if you delete these things, [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1699.0s)]
*  because you're supposed to keep [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1701.0s)]
*  them as part of the record for [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1703.0s)]
*  the executive branch. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1705.0s)]
*  And why do you think they're [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1707.0s)]
*  going on, say no, so [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1708.0s)]
*  they could delete them so [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1709.0s)]
*  that people can't see them. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1710.0s)]
*  Which by the way, was the same [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1712.0s)]
*  reason that Hillary did it. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1713.0s)]
*  And so we're like, I don't know if [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1714.0s)]
*  we're the only show left in [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1716.0s)]
*  America that is not biased, but [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1717.0s)]
*  it was wrong when Hillary did it, [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1719.0s)]
*  it's wrong when Pete Hegseth does [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1721.0s)]
*  it. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1723.0s)]
*  But for Hegseth and Fox News and [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1724.0s)]
*  all those guys, Hillary, right? [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1726.0s)]
*  I mean meltdown for years and [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1729.0s)]
*  years and years. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1731.0s)]
*  But look, so Hegseth does it now, [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1733.0s)]
*  Mike Waltz does it, [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1735.0s)]
*  they all do it. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1736.0s)]
*  But remember in the first [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1737.0s)]
*  administration, the minute they [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1738.0s)]
*  went in, the Trump kids did it, [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1740.0s)]
*  Ivanka did it, Jared Kushner did [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1742.0s)]
*  it, and he was in charge of [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1744.0s)]
*  Middle East policy. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1745.0s)]
*  And they're like, [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1746.0s)]
*  I guess they love Hillary Clinton. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1747.0s)]
*  They view her as a role model. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1749.0s)]
*  And they're like, you know what, [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1751.0s)]
*  anything she does, and maybe I was [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1753.0s)]
*  going to say that maybe they'll do [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1755.0s)]
*  speeches to the banks next, but [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1757.0s)]
*  that's just amateur hour. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1759.0s)]
*  Hillary got a couple hundred [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1761.0s)]
*  thousand dollars of speech. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1762.0s)]
*  Jared Kushner was like, [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1763.0s)]
*  I got two billion from the Saudis. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1764.0s)]
*  Eric Trump just yesterday was like, [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1766.0s)]
*  I got two billion from [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1768.0s)]
*  the United Arab Emirates. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1769.0s)]
*  Corruption, Hunter Biden, you [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1770.0s)]
*  amateur. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1772.0s)]
*  Hillary Clinton, you novice, okay? [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1773.0s)]
*  Taking it in the hundreds of [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1776.0s)]
*  thousands or millions, we're taking [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1778.0s)]
*  it in the billions. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1780.0s)]
*  So all this is reality. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1781.0s)]
*  From here to the end of his term, [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1784.0s)]
*  is hardcore MAGA going to say about [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1787.0s)]
*  every story? [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1790.0s)]
*  It's fake news, even though they [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1791.0s)]
*  all admit it, everything is fake [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1793.0s)]
*  news. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1795.0s)]
*  Heg said there's a genius and [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1796.0s)]
*  a military strategist. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1798.0s)]
*  I saw him play risk once. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1800.0s)]
*  I can't believe that he started in [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1801.0s)]
*  Australia and New Zealand and [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1803.0s)]
*  he expanded out in one. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1805.0s)]
*  Guys, he's supposed to box up [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1807.0s)]
*  friends on the weekends. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1809.0s)]
*  Who are we? [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1811.0s)]
*  Remember, he threw the freaking [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1812.0s)]
*  axe in some stupid stunt that they [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1814.0s)]
*  did for Fox and Friends and threw [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1816.0s)]
*  it over the target and [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1818.0s)]
*  nearly killed the band guy behind [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1819.0s)]
*  the target. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1821.0s)]
*  This is not like some rocket [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1822.0s)]
*  scientist. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1824.0s)]
*  And also, this is so absurd. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1825.0s)]
*  It's like imagine if Bernie won and [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1827.0s)]
*  he's like, no, [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1829.0s)]
*  my new Secretary of Defense, [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1830.0s)]
*  Brett Ehrlich from Happy Half Hour. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1832.0s)]
*  I mean, Brett's only 2,000 times [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1834.0s)]
*  smarter than Hegseth, but [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1837.0s)]
*  it would be a great thing. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1839.0s)]
*  It would be surprising. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1841.8s)]
*  So you pick a clown, you get a [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1843.0s)]
*  clown, I'm beginning to think that [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1846.0s)]
*  that's the simple answer here. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1849.0s)]
*  That there isn't some sophisticated [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1851.0s)]
*  haze of the neocons or [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1853.0s)]
*  not the neocons. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1854.0s)]
*  That exists in parts of [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1855.0s)]
*  the government. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1856.0s)]
*  But for Hegseth, I think it's [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1857.0s)]
*  mainly like, anyway, I don't want [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1859.0s)]
*  to get into speculation about why [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1862.0s)]
*  he's a hot mess, right? [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1864.0s)]
*  But he's clearly a hot mess. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1866.0s)]
*  I kind of love the idea of Brett [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1870.0s)]
*  Ehrlich in our government, for [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1872.0s)]
*  better or for worse. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1874.0s)]
*  You know, Lisa would be [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1875.0s)]
*  entertaining for a lot of people, [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1876.0s)]
*  including me. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1877.0s)]
*  So there is one little addendum to [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1878.0s)]
*  this story that I want to get to [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1880.0s)]
*  quickly. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1881.0s)]
*  So Trump insists that despite [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1882.0s)]
*  appearances, Pete Hegseth is [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1884.0s)]
*  actually doing a great job in his [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1886.0s)]
*  role as a defense secretary, even [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1888.0s)]
*  though he is wildly unqualified for [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1890.0s)]
*  that position. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1892.0s)]
*  So reports say that just a week or [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1893.0s)]
*  so into Trump's second [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1895.0s)]
*  administration, the military would [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1896.0s)]
*  head set at the helm, ordered three [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1898.0s)]
*  freight airlines to stop 11 flights [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1900.0s)]
*  loaded with weaponry that were [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1902.0s)]
*  bound for Ukraine. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1904.0s)]
*  And that isn't the story. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1905.0s)]
*  The story is that this order [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1907.0s)]
*  created such chaos, not just in [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1909.0s)]
*  Ukraine, where the weaponry was [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1911.0s)]
*  bound, not just in Poland, where [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1913.0s)]
*  everything was supposed to be [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1915.0s)]
*  coordinated, but also in the White [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1917.0s)]
*  House, because Trump never told [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1919.0s)]
*  Hegseth to ground any of these [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1921.0s)]
*  flights. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1923.0s)]
*  So the whole fiasco was about [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1924.0s)]
*  getting the military to stop [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1926.0s)]
*  the war, and so the whole fiasco [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1928.0s)]
*  went beyond just a new [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1930.0s)]
*  administration settling in and [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1931.0s)]
*  getting their feet wet. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1933.0s)]
*  It really was just a whole [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1934.0s)]
*  demonstration that communication [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1935.0s)]
*  within the administration was [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1937.0s)]
*  lacking, first of all, also that [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1939.0s)]
*  the goals of the administration, [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1941.0s)]
*  however they were being [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1943.0s)]
*  communicated internally, not even [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1944.0s)]
*  talking about externally to us, [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1946.0s)]
*  but even internally, were poorly [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1948.0s)]
*  defined, and that the people that [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1950.0s)]
*  Trump had appointed into these [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1952.0s)]
*  positions were wildly, as I said, [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1954.0s)]
*  unqualified for those positions. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1956.0s)]
*  So that's just one last little [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1958.0s)]
*  thing, but again, Trump seems [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1960.0s)]
*  reluctant to get rid of Hegseth [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1962.0s)]
*  because, as I said earlier, he's [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1964.0s)]
*  kind of a Trump yes man. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1966.0s)]
*  He has been loyal to Trump for [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1967.0s)]
*  a long time in his tenure at Fox [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1969.0s)]
*  News, and he has proven to Trump [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1971.0s)]
*  that I'll do whatever you want, [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1973.0s)]
*  and that's why he has the job he [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1975.0s)]
*  has. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1977.0s)]
*  Yeah, I actually think the second [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1978.0s)]
*  one's worse. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1980.0s)]
*  He stopped these military aid [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1981.0s)]
*  going to Ukraine without any [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1983.0s)]
*  authorization, and everybody's [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1985.0s)]
*  like, what are you doing? [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1987.0s)]
*  Nobody told you to do that. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1989.0s)]
*  Why'd you do that? [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1991.0s)]
*  I don't know, let's start them [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1992.0s)]
*  again. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1995.0s)]
*  Look, I don't know if I'm supposed [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1996.0s)]
*  to do the speculation or not, but [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=1998.0s)]
*  I'm not saying it. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2000.0s)]
*  Stoner Wolf, who's a Young Turks [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2001.0s)]
*  member on YouTube, is saying it. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2003.0s)]
*  He said drunk people tend to leak [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2005.0s)]
*  a lot. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2007.0s)]
*  Okay, that's kind of funny. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2008.0s)]
*  Now seriously, guys, [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2010.0s)]
*  I don't know if Hegseth's drunk. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2011.0s)]
*  I don't know if Hegseth's drunk at [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2012.0s)]
*  all, I have no idea. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2013.0s)]
*  But I do know this, right? [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2014.0s)]
*  Now we have, he fired all, tons of [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2016.0s)]
*  his top aides. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2020.0s)]
*  They've gone on shows like Tiger [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2022.0s)]
*  Carlson's, and everybody's like, [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2024.0s)]
*  why were they fired? [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2026.0s)]
*  What does this have to do with [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2027.0s)]
*  anything? [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2029.0s)]
*  He's leaking like a madman on a [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2030.0s)]
*  bent or on Signal and everywhere [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2032.0s)]
*  else. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2034.0s)]
*  He's giving authority to his [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2035.0s)]
*  assistant to do these things that [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2037.0s)]
*  he shouldn't be doing. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2039.0s)]
*  And now he's canceling actual [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2040.0s)]
*  military equipment that needs to go [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2042.0s)]
*  to a war zone when he shouldn't be. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2044.0s)]
*  There's no other way to describe [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2046.0s)]
*  that than hot mess, right? [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2049.0s)]
*  But now I'm going to go over to [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2052.0s)]
*  Bernie picking bread as [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2054.0s)]
*  defense secretary. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2056.0s)]
*  He's not just unhappy half hour. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2058.0s)]
*  He's really good on rebel [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2060.0s)]
*  headquarters. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2061.0s)]
*  I like him there. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2062.0s)]
*  Why did I give him the Trump hands? [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2063.0s)]
*  And was that a good Bernie? [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2065.0s)]
*  Probably not. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2066.0s)]
*  Okay, anyways, all right, well, [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2067.0s)]
*  our national security is in danger. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2069.0s)]
*  I guess we can have a laugh over [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2071.0s)]
*  it. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2072.0s)]
*  I'm back on CIT, Cenk, Yaz and [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2073.0s)]

*  All right, yeah, so what's next? [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2125.54s)]
*  All right, let's get into this [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2127.36s)]
*  next story. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2128.84s)]
*  No tax on overtime. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2129.44s)]
*  All right, no tax on overtime pay, [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2133.84s)]
*  that was one of Trump's signature [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2136.48s)]
*  promises to the American people. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2138.88s)]
*  And Republicans in the Senate are [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2141.34s)]
*  working to get it passed or [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2143.52s)]
*  are they? [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2145.18s)]
*  We will have to see, Cenk, [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2145.7599999999998s)]
*  what do you think? [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2147.44s)]
*  Are they actually going to follow [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2148.64s)]
*  through on this promise? [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2150.36s)]
*  Yeah, I would have said in the [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2151.72s)]
*  beginning, [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2153.2s)]
*  there's no way they're going to do [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2154.04s)]
*  this. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2156.0s)]
*  But actually, there's something in [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2156.52s)]
*  this story that makes me think, [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2158.58s)]
*  maybe, maybe, I'll tell you why [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2160.36s)]
*  it's a maybe, why it might be a [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2162.36s)]
*  trick anyway. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2164.12s)]
*  But most of all, they promised a [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2164.8s)]
*  great number of things and I'll [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2166.7599999999998s)]
*  tell you the things that they have [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2168.68s)]
*  no chance on delivering on. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2170.8s)]
*  It's the things that they have [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2172.56s)]
*  a chance of delivering on. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2174.2s)]
*  So really interesting story [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2175.7599999999998s)]
*  overall, let's get the details. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2177.16s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's a great [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2178.96s)]
*  thing, Cenk. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2180.36s)]
*  I think that's a great thing, [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2181.08s)]
*  let's get the details. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2182.54s)]
*  Yeah, and I feel like a lot of [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2183.78s)]
*  times I want to be optimist and [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2185.5s)]
*  be like, maybe they will do [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2187.22s)]
*  something that they said they were [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2188.66s)]
*  going to do, but I'm more [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2190.42s)]
*  disappointed than I am not. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2191.78s)]
*  But I try to stay open minded. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2193.5s)]
*  So according to the Wall Street [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2195.54s)]
*  Journal, there are two different [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2197.1s)]
*  versions of the proposal in [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2198.74s)]
*  the Senate right now. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2200.02s)]
*  Here is the less generous version [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2201.2599999999998s)]
*  from Republican Senator Roger [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2203.78s)]
*  Marshall. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2206.22s)]
*  The proposal is capped at $10,000 [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2207.42s)]
*  for individuals and $20,000 for [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2209.82s)]
*  married couples. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2212.04s)]
*  The break for overtime pay would [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2213.52s)]
*  start phasing out once individual [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2215.8s)]
*  adjusted gross income reaches [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2218.28s)]
*  $100,000 or when a married couple's [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2220.54s)]
*  income reaches $200,000. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2223.32s)]
*  At the 22% marginal tax rate that [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2225.7599999999998s)]
*  applies to many taxpayers in this [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2228.16s)]
*  range, a deduction for $20,000 in [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2230.52s)]
*  overtime pay would save $4,400 in [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2233.24s)]
*  taxes, okay? [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2236.0s)]
*  So that's one, [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2237.96s)]
*  that's the less generous one. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2238.8s)]
*  This is the more generous proposal, [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2240.54s)]
*  I'm very surprised about who [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2242.74s)]
*  it comes from. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2244.48s)]
*  So a bill from Senator Ted Cruz, [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2245.78s)]
*  Republican from Texas and [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2247.66s)]
*  Representative Vern Buchanan, [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2249.2s)]
*  Republican from Florida, [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2251.08s)]
*  limits the break to $25,000 and [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2252.8s)]
*  denies the break to people above [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2254.9s)]
*  a high income threshold that is [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2257.02s)]
*  $160,000 this year. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2259.06s)]
*  So the question is, [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2261.02s)]
*  even if this does get passed, [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2262.66s)]
*  how many Americans would actually [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2264.86s)]
*  be affected by this policy? [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2267.28s)]
*  And according to the Yale Budget [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2269.28s)]
*  Lab, about 8% of hourly workers and [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2271.48s)]
*  4% of salaried workers regularly [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2273.96s)]
*  work overtime. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2276.6000000000004s)]
*  So not a whole lot, but some, and [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2278.0200000000004s)]
*  to be fair, that is a campaign [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2280.2200000000003s)]
*  promise, but Cenk, [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2282.2000000000003s)]
*  I want to get your thoughts on [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2283.44s)]
*  this, what gives you pause with all [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2285.1600000000003s)]
*  of this? [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2287.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, and so in the beginning I was [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2287.84s)]
*  like, there's no way in the world [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2289.28s)]
*  they're going to do this because if [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2290.6000000000004s)]
*  you just did a blanket rule on not [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2292.28s)]
*  taxing overtime, it would cost [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2294.0400000000004s)]
*  $680 billion to 1.3. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2295.78s)]
*  Billion to $1.3 trillion. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2297.3s)]
*  So now remember they already have [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2300.7400000000002s)]
*  around, it started with 4.5, [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2303.5800000000004s)]
*  it looks like they're up to [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2305.8s)]
*  $5.5 trillion in tax cuts for [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2307.5600000000004s)]
*  corporations and the wealthy. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2309.5800000000004s)]
*  So they would have to layer this on [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2312.1400000000003s)]
*  top, so now we're talking about [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2314.02s)]
*  what, $6.8 trillion in tax cuts? [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2315.98s)]
*  And we haven't even gotten to the [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2319.02s)]
*  not taxing tips, which is another [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2321.5800000000004s)]
*  outlandish, [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2324.1800000000003s)]
*  campaign promise that Trump had, [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2325.7s)]
*  because he was just giving out [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2327.9399999999996s)]
*  candy, right? [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2330.14s)]
*  I'm not taxing this, [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2331.54s)]
*  I'm not taxing that. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2332.4199999999996s)]
*  So, but in order to do that, [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2333.7799999999997s)]
*  they've got to do some cuts, [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2335.4599999999996s)]
*  even when they go to do a cut, [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2337.3199999999997s)]
*  as we'll tell you about later in [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2339.14s)]
*  the show, of like $230 billion on [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2341.06s)]
*  basically food stamps. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2343.2999999999997s)]
*  People, including Republicans, [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2345.4599999999996s)]
*  are like, no, [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2347.2599999999998s)]
*  tons of MAGA guys get food stamps. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2348.06s)]
*  You can't cut that. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2350.66s)]
*  Okay, so Doge at most cut [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2352.3799999999997s)]
*  $130 billion. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2354.2s)]
*  They're now struggling with [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2356.04s)]
*  a $230 billion. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2357.8399999999997s)]
*  Where are you going to get [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2359.3599999999997s)]
*  the other $7 trillion? [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2360.6s)]
*  So this is absurd, right? [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2361.56s)]
*  But the only reason why they might [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2364.3999999999996s)]
*  do this one is because Trump, [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2366.48s)]
*  unless he's just going to absolutely [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2368.3999999999996s)]
*  raw dog them, he has to give one of [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2370.72s)]
*  his campaign promises to the [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2372.9199999999996s)]
*  average guy, and in a limited [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2374.9199999999996s)]
*  fashion, so he could say, [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2376.9199999999996s)]
*  I cut the taxes on tips, or [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2378.72s)]
*  I cut the taxes on overtime. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2380.3999999999996s)]
*  One of those things, [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2382.52s)]
*  there's no way he's going to do [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2383.7s)]
*  them all, and he doesn't care about [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2385.06s)]
*  them, that was just to win [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2386.52s)]
*  the election. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2387.4199999999996s)]
*  The only ones he actually cares [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2388.2999999999997s)]
*  about, the tax cuts he cares about [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2389.62s)]
*  are for corporations who are his [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2391.06s)]
*  donors and the wealthy, and he's [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2392.46s)]
*  wealthy and everyone he knows is [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2394.1s)]
*  wealthy. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2395.62s)]
*  So those are locked in, so [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2396.4199999999996s)]
*  that's our base. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2398.3399999999997s)]
*  You start with about $5 trillion in [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2400.54s)]
*  tax cuts for the rich to begin [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2402.46s)]
*  with, then you're going to layer [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2404.18s)]
*  these on top, because average guy [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2405.8999999999996s)]
*  is the very last priority. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2407.58s)]
*  And by the way, [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2409.02s)]
*  Republicans quote me on everything, [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2409.8199999999997s)]
*  okay? [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2412.14s)]
*  So if it turns out that he does all [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2412.96s)]
*  the tax cuts for the average guy, [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2415.04s)]
*  tips, overtime, social security, [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2417.28s)]
*  etc., and he doesn't do corporate [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2419.64s)]
*  tax cuts, and he doesn't do tax [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2421.7200000000003s)]
*  cuts for the rich, [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2423.6s)]
*  there's no chance. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2424.68s)]
*  All right, but I'll eat my shorts, [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2426.12s)]
*  there's no way that's going to [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2428.36s)]
*  happen, in fact, [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2430.44s)]
*  Trump has already said, [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2431.66s)]
*  he flirted with like, well, maybe [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2433.28s)]
*  we shouldn't cut taxes on the rich [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2435.36s)]
*  again, and then everybody beat him [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2437.28s)]
*  up, Sean Hannity was like, [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2439.16s)]
*  how dare you, don't you know [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2440.7400000000002s)]
*  the Republican Party stands for [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2442.3s)]
*  the rich like me? [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2444.1400000000003s)]
*  And then like the day later, [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2445.42s)]
*  Trump was like, I'm so sorry, [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2446.82s)]
*  I'm so sorry, of course, of course, [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2448.38s)]
*  the rich get everything first, [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2450.2200000000003s)]
*  first, right? [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2451.7400000000002s)]
*  So now, all of that, but [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2452.46s)]
*  why might this one pass? [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2454.7000000000003s)]
*  Because what Yaz was explaining to [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2457.46s)]
*  you guys is that they've actually [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2459.46s)]
*  now reduced it so much, hey, [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2461.5400000000004s)]
*  it doesn't apply to money, [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2463.38s)]
*  incomes above this, it doesn't [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2465.0s)]
*  apply to wages past that. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2466.88s)]
*  So they narrowed it and narrowed it [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2468.5800000000004s)]
*  down to what this latest proposal [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2470.52s)]
*  is about 25% of the original number. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2473.0s)]
*  So if it's like $250 billion, [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2477.08s)]
*  that's still a huge number in [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2479.24s)]
*  the real world. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2481.44s)]
*  But in a gigantic $5, [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2482.84s)]
*  $6 trillion tax cut, they might [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2484.64s)]
*  think, I mean, who cares, [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2487.32s)]
*  we're blowing a giant hole in [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2489.26s)]
*  the deficit and the budget and [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2491.24s)]
*  the debt anyway, so throw that in [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2493.4s)]
*  there so we can brag about it. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2495.62s)]
*  And remember, [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2497.92s)]
*  it's really limited, right? [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2498.64s)]
*  It cannot be impossible. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2500.06s)]
*  We asked you guys in a poll on [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2500.94s)]
*  the live show, it's 6 to 8 o'clock [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2502.3s)]
*  every day, then at 8 o'clock we're [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2504.14s)]
*  doing interviews like today with [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2505.86s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor Greene. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2507.42s)]
*  Anyways, whether you guys think [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2508.62s)]
*  that there will be no taxes on [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2511.22s)]
*  overtime or not, I'm curious to see [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2513.46s)]
*  what you guys think, but like that, [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2516.02s)]
*  I know is the logical answer. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2518.52s)]
*  But in this rare case, maybe this [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2520.42s)]
*  is the one that they give to [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2522.84s)]
*  the MAGA base because they limited [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2524.72s)]
*  it so much and it's not nearly as [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2527.18s)]
*  big as it used to be. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2529.32s)]
*  So that's my theory on it, but [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2530.84s)]
*  look, if it turns out they don't [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2532.7000000000003s)]
*  give anything to the average guy [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2534.7000000000003s)]
*  and they give everything to the [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2536.6400000000003s)]
*  rich, I wouldn't be 1% surprised. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2538.5600000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I think that was really my [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2540.88s)]
*  thought on the whole thing too is [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2542.96s)]
*  you were talking about how Trump is [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2545.04s)]
*  giving out tax cuts like candy. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2547.36s)]
*  I mean, he just says whatever [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2549.92s)]
*  comes to his head and [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2551.2000000000003s)]
*  then that becomes policy. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2552.02s)]
*  So we see for ourselves that there [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2553.6000000000004s)]
*  really isn't as overarching of [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2556.1600000000003s)]
*  a plan or strategy in place as many [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2558.34s)]
*  of us would hope that there are. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2560.6200000000003s)]
*  But I do agree, I figure that this [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2562.82s)]
*  is just a really easy campaign [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2564.98s)]
*  promise for him to keep. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2566.9s)]
*  Just so you can say I did something [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2569.02s)]
*  for the working man, I did something [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2570.7400000000002s)]
*  for the average American, [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2572.6800000000003s)]
*  even though what was it, 4 or 8% of [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2574.38s)]
*  hourly or salaried workers would [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2576.54s)]
*  actually feel the impacts of this [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2578.7000000000003s)]
*  and with people who fall within [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2580.7000000000003s)]
*  the parameters. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2582.5800000000004s)]
*  So there is some part of doing [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2583.94s)]
*  a job like this where you do [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2585.86s)]
*  feel a bit of Seanan Froide or [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2587.68s)]
*  and I told you so. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2589.72s)]
*  If you see that the administration [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2591.2s)]
*  is not following through on any of [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2593.16s)]
*  the plans that they said they were [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2595.0s)]
*  going to do for the American people [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2596.72s)]
*  because you want to say, [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2598.5s)]
*  you know what, we told you this was [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2599.7999999999997s)]
*  going to happen, why did you vote [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2601.64s)]
*  this way, maybe don't do it again [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2603.3599999999997s)]
*  in the future. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2605.16s)]
*  But at the same time, you do [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2606.04s)]
*  actually want good things to happen [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2607.64s)]
*  to the American people, right? [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2609.64s)]
*  So if something does get passed for [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2611.64s)]
*  them, I'm not going to be like, [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2613.24s)]
*  it's not enough, you do more, [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2614.6s)]
*  even though it really isn't enough. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2616.06s)]
*  I do want to be able to celebrate [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2618.3s)]
*  something that happens good for [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2619.86s)]
*  the average American person, but [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2621.36s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2623.1s)]
*  This isn't as exciting as I would [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2624.34s)]
*  like for it to be. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2625.86s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, we're talking about [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2626.98s)]
*  a quarter of 8%, right? [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2629.02s)]
*  8% of people are at least hourly [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2630.98s)]
*  workers, right? [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2633.22s)]
*  And they've now reduced the tax cut [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2634.86s)]
*  for those folks a quarter. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2637.06s)]
*  So that's why it's like a tiny bit [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2638.86s)]
*  of a release valve and [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2641.54s)]
*  a fake promise kept, even if they [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2644.0s)]
*  do it, which I'm not sure they're [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2645.96s)]
*  going to, okay. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2648.0s)]
*  But guys, the number one thing that [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2649.0s)]
*  I want to leave you with is, [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2651.4s)]
*  they're not even trying to balance [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2653.36s)]
*  the budget. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2655.88s)]
*  So if you're Mago, you're an [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2657.28s)]
*  independent who voted for Trump, [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2659.04s)]
*  and you think, no, no, no, [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2661.32s)]
*  they're going to magically cut $5, [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2663.28s)]
*  $6 trillion from the budget. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2665.92s)]
*  I bet there's waste, fraud, and [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2668.64s)]
*  abuse for that kind of number. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2670.32s)]
*  You're in La La Land. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2672.58s)]
*  I will guarantee you 100%, [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2674.66s)]
*  quote me on it, never watch the [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2676.66s)]
*  show if I'm not right. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2678.86s)]
*  They will not balance the budget [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2680.9s)]
*  any of the four years [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2682.54s)]
*  that Trump is in office. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2683.54s)]
*  They won't come close. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2684.42s)]
*  This year, they're going to put [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2686.34s)]
*  this massive, massive hole [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2690.02s)]
*  in the budget. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2692.82s)]
*  I mean, anywhere from 4 to 6, [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2694.38s)]
*  7 trillion dollars. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2697.02s)]
*  Remember last time Trump added 8 [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2699.06s)]
*  trillion dollars to the debt, [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2701.6s)]
*  more than any other president in [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2703.84s)]
*  US history. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2706.2s)]
*  And this time he's saying, yeah, [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2707.7599999999998s)]
*  Trump won, hold my beer. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2709.7599999999998s)]
*  I'm going to add even more tax cuts [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2711.4s)]
*  for the rich and absolutely [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2713.3199999999997s)]
*  pulverize this budget. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2714.7599999999998s)]
*  There is a 0% chance they're going [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2716.44s)]
*  to balance the budget. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2718.52s)]
*  So when I'm right about that, [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2720.04s)]
*  remember who told you the truth, [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2721.68s)]
*  and who BS'd you. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2723.48s)]
*  because if there's right-wing [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2724.84s)]
*  shows out there now pretending [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2726.02s)]
*  that he's going to balance [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2727.24s)]
*  the budget, [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2728.2799999999997s)]
*  that's a humiliating prediction. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2728.92s)]
*  There's no chance of that. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2732.04s)]
*  So let's see how this particular [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2733.7599999999998s)]
*  tax cut works out. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2736.12s)]
*  But overall, we're all going to [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2738.08s)]
*  have to pay for this later. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2740.0s)]
*  He's the king of debt, and [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2742.16s)]
*  he's going to pile on more debt [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2743.88s)]
*  onto America than any other [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2745.72s)]
*  president and [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2747.48s)]
*  stick us with the bill. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2748.68s)]
*  That's what he's famous for. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2750.12s)]
*  That's what he did in business. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2751.64s)]
*  And that's what he's about to do [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2753.12s)]
*  to the American taxpayer. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2754.44s)]
*  All right, we got to take [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2756.2s)]
*  a break here. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2756.96s)]
*  When we come back, [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2757.44s)]
*  is Donald Trump going to help [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2758.68s)]

*  unabated and the lack of homework [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2864.18s)]
*  continues unabated. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2866.22s)]

*  imposed a ludicrous 100% tariff? [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2874.4199999999996s)]
*  Do you know if that's actually [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2876.7799999999997s)]
*  going to help the movie industry or [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2878.58s)]
*  hurt the movie industry? [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2880.66s)]
*  Here's the amount of homework he's [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2882.14s)]
*  done on it. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2883.7799999999997s)]
*  And you all know it even if you're [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2884.52s)]
*  mad, you know it, zero, none. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2886.0s)]
*  So let's find out what's actually [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2888.56s)]
*  going to happen. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2889.76s)]
*  Yeah, well, [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2890.32s)]
*  Trump also has all of his acting [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2891.08s)]
*  credits, he was in Home Alone 2. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2892.6800000000003s)]
*  He was in Two Weeks Notice with [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2894.48s)]
*  Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant, so [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2896.48s)]
*  good for him. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2898.7200000000003s)]
*  But that's not what we're talking [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2899.96s)]
*  about right now. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2901.48s)]
*  John Boyd and I do seem to be [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2902.36s)]
*  in agreement that Hollywood needs [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2903.6400000000003s)]
*  to be a little bit revamped, [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2905.28s)]
*  that it's not as good as it used to [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2906.56s)]
*  be, although we probably have [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2908.04s)]
*  different ideas as to why. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2909.48s)]
*  But here's more from him on what [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2911.2400000000002s)]
*  is wrong with Hollywood and [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2913.02s)]
*  sort of what he plans to do about [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2914.76s)]
*  it and you guys, it's a lot worse [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2916.66s)]
*  than any of us thought. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2918.82s)]
*  And many Americans have lost jobs [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2922.38s)]
*  to productions that have gone [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2924.14s)]
*  overseas. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2925.68s)]
*  It's been very serious. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2926.22s)]
*  People have lost their homes, [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2928.3s)]
*  can't feed their families. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2931.9s)]
*  After meeting with many of [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2935.82s)]
*  the entertainment leaders, [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2937.26s)]
*  I have brought forward [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2939.14s)]
*  recommendations to the president [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2940.4s)]
*  for certain tax provisions that can [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2942.7200000000003s)]
*  help the industry. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2944.84s)]
*  Some provisions that could be [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2946.28s)]
*  extended and others that could be [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2948.92s)]
*  revived or instituted. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2951.6400000000003s)]
*  This would help the movie and [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2953.8s)]
*  television production and [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2955.32s)]
*  our beloved theaters that are so [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2956.82s)]
*  important to the American family [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2958.44s)]
*  experience. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2960.12s)]
*  So he didn't say a whole lot about [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2962.6s)]
*  what the issues are specifically [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2964.4s)]
*  that he's trying to address in [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2966.08s)]
*  Hollywood, nor did he say a whole [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2967.5s)]
*  lot about his plan to address these [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2969.2400000000002s)]
*  issues. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2971.42s)]
*  He didn't elaborate very much on [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2972.5s)]
*  any of those tax provisions. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2974.18s)]
*  The video was about two minutes [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2975.94s)]
*  long on X and I showed you most of [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2977.8599999999997s)]
*  it, the rest of it was just him [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2979.8599999999997s)]
*  talking about what a great [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2981.74s)]
*  president and person Donald Trump [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2983.42s)]
*  is. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2985.66s)]
*  Also, he said he puts Donald Trump [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2986.7s)]
*  up there as one of the best [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2988.98s)]
*  presidents this country has ever [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2990.74s)]
*  seen right up there with Abraham [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2992.94s)]
*  Lincoln and George Washington. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2995.2599999999998s)]
*  And then he also name drops [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2997.9s)]
*  and said that's my buddy. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=2999.52s)]
*  So that's nice. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3001.0s)]
*  But speaking of Sylvester Stallone, [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3002.52s)]
*  him Mel Gibson and John Boyd, [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3004.72s)]
*  they are Trump's special [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3006.56s)]
*  ambassadors to Hollywood. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3008.06s)]
*  So everyone Hollywood we are in [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3009.96s)]
*  great hands there. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3011.8s)]
*  But while this does feel like [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3013.64s)]
*  a ridiculous story, [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3015.2s)]
*  there is actually a little bit more [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3016.34s)]
*  to it. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3018.16s)]
*  So Trump announced this week that [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3018.68s)]
*  he wants a 100% tariff on movies [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3020.68s)]
*  produced outside of the United [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3022.6s)]
*  States. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3024.5s)]
*  A move that could irreparably [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3025.44s)]
*  damage the existing American film [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3027.24s)]

*  That's all anyone asked for. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3080.88s)]

*  Why? [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3091.2599999999998s)]
*  Just why? [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3091.98s)]
*  I'm sorry, if Hollywood is unable [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3092.9399999999996s)]
*  to lower its costs, there's no [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3094.8599999999997s)]

*  All movies and TV shows now, [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3100.14s)]
*  this has been going on for [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3101.3399999999997s)]

*  outside of Hollywood. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3103.7799999999997s)]
*  Hollywood has emptied itself out. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3104.5s)]
*  And that has forced them to [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3107.5s)]
*  actually move their own businesses [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3108.9399999999996s)]
*  to places like Vancouver and Canada [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3110.8199999999997s)]
*  or go to other states like Georgia [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3112.66s)]
*  in order to film or go abroad to [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3114.5s)]
*  Romania or Hungary or [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3116.12s)]
*  wherever else in order to film. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3117.48s)]
*  So President Trump thinks that by [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3119.04s)]
*  radically increasing the cost on [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3120.96s)]
*  movie production in a time when [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3122.88s)]
*  streaming is already eating out [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3124.52s)]
*  the profit margins of all of [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3126.2799999999997s)]
*  the movie making industry. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3127.68s)]
*  That is a very badly calibrated [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3129.7999999999997s)]
*  executive order. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3131.12s)]
*  So from the truth social posts, [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3133.48s)]
*  the thing that Ben Shapiro took [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3135.36s)]
*  a special problem with was when [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3137.2s)]
*  Trump said the movies made outside [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3139.12s)]
*  of this country pose national [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3141.24s)]
*  security threats. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3143.04s)]
*  So here's what he had to say about [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3144.36s)]
*  it. So he's saying it's a national [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3146.98s)]
*  security threat for [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3148.5s)]
*  Romania to offer a tax incentive to [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3149.5s)]
*  film in Romania. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3151.5s)]
*  I'm sorry, that is not even remotely [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3152.66s)]
*  a national security threat. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3154.14s)]
*  It may be a threat to Tom Cruise's [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3155.26s)]
*  next paycheck, but that is not a [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3157.14s)]
*  national security threat. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3158.94s)]
*  If Matthew McConaughey makes less [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3160.34s)]
*  money because films are being made [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3162.74s)]
*  or a key grip in Hollywood has to [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3165.02s)]
*  travel in order to go film over in [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3167.22s)]
*  Budapest, that is not remotely [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3169.42s)]
*  a national security threat. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3171.66s)]
*  We are emptying the term national [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3173.42s)]
*  security threat of pretty much all [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3174.78s)]
*  content. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3176.28s)]
*  So Ben Shapiro also asked, [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3179.4s)]
*  where's the demand for [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3180.92s)]
*  any of this, right? [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3182.2400000000002s)]
*  Nobody asked for this. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3183.6800000000003s)]
*  This isn't what we wanted when we [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3184.84s)]
*  said that we need foreign entities [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3187.2000000000003s)]
*  out of our government and [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3189.6000000000004s)]
*  out of our influence or [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3191.28s)]
*  out of our sphere of influence for [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3192.84s)]
*  the majority of Americans. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3195.0400000000004s)]
*  And to that point, Ben Shapiro [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3196.96s)]
*  actually said if you actually [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3198.48s)]
*  wanted to do something about [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3199.96s)]
*  foreign propaganda infiltrating [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3201.48s)]
*  the United States, [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3203.3s)]
*  do something about TikTok. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3204.38s)]
*  So that's what he suggests. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3205.5400000000004s)]
*  Cenk, this goes beyond movies and [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3207.1000000000004s)]
*  entertainment. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3208.9s)]
*  For one, it talks to government [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3209.6600000000003s)]
*  control and government overreach [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3211.7000000000003s)]
*  into certain aspects. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3213.78s)]
*  Also, this feels like maybe it's [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3215.5s)]
*  just a little too close for [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3217.34s)]
*  comfort to actually censoring [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3218.88s)]
*  Hollywood and the things that [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3220.5800000000004s)]
*  they're able to produce. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3222.26s)]
*  And also, stopping other films from [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3223.94s)]
*  coming into this country. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3225.6600000000003s)]
*  And I just want to clarify, [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3226.82s)]
*  he's not saying that we're not [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3228.1800000000003s)]
*  going to be able to watch foreign [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3229.78s)]
*  films in this country anymore. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3231.42s)]
*  He's trying to prevent Hollywood [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3232.8s)]
*  studios from going outside of [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3234.88s)]
*  the country. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3236.78s)]
*  because a lot of movies get made in [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3237.6000000000004s)]
*  places like Canada especially, but [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3239.6400000000003s)]
*  he wants to prevent that from [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3241.84s)]
*  happening more. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3243.4s)]
*  And he said he's going to do [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3244.6400000000003s)]
*  a 100% tariff to prevent that. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3246.0s)]
*  But Trump is also taking something [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3248.28s)]
*  that I think many Americans agree [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3250.2000000000003s)]
*  with that Hollywood is not what it [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3252.0400000000004s)]
*  used to be. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3253.88s)]
*  Entertainment, frankly, I mean, [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3255.1600000000003s)]
*  there's a lot I could say about [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3256.76s)]
*  that, but that's not what [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3258.1600000000003s)]
*  the show is about. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3259.1600000000003s)]
*  But it really, it's something that [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3259.84s)]
*  a lot of Americans have issues with [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3261.38s)]
*  right now. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3263.1s)]
*  But instead of doing things that [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3263.94s)]
*  would actually help to address [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3265.7400000000002s)]
*  the issue, he's being a little bit [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3267.5s)]
*  disingenuous and he's proposing [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3269.5s)]
*  a solution that isn't actually [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3271.3s)]
*  going to help anything that he says [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3272.94s)]
*  it's going to help. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3274.7400000000002s)]
*  So as is usually the case with him, [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3275.78s)]
*  he's offering a very misguided and [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3277.58s)]
*  disingenuous solution to [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3279.42s)]

*  Cenk, I know you have a little bit [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3282.1400000000003s)]
*  more on the story. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3283.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, so I'm going to tell you how [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3284.26s)]
*  it affected Hollywood and [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3285.7400000000002s)]
*  what they might actually do instead [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3286.94s)]
*  of this. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3288.6200000000003s)]
*  But first on Ben Shapiro, so [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3289.48s)]
*  I agree and disagree. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3291.3599999999997s)]
*  So is it a national security [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3293.2s)]
*  threat? [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3294.56s)]
*  That's a joke, of course, [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3295.2799999999997s)]
*  not a national security threat, [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3296.24s)]
*  right? [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3297.56s)]
*  So Ben's right about that. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3298.08s)]
*  And then he's like, we're [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3300.56s)]
*  inventing all sorts of national [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3302.16s)]
*  security threats. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3304.3199999999997s)]
*  Brother, you started that with, [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3305.56s)]
*  my God, if you criticize Israel, [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3308.56s)]
*  that is a national security threat [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3311.04s)]
*  to America. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3313.4s)]
*  So you started making that crap up [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3316.12s)]
*  a while back. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3318.08s)]
*  Are you surprised now that he's [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3319.26s)]
*  just extending it to more things [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3320.6800000000003s)]
*  that are definitely not a national [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3321.98s)]
*  security threat? [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3323.42s)]
*  And then I love at the end of [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3324.3s)]
*  the video when he's like, no, [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3325.34s)]
*  the real thing to Ben is TikTok. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3326.58s)]
*  They're showing people what's [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3328.66s)]
*  actually happening in Gaza. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3330.02s)]
*  If they find out what Israel's [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3331.38s)]
*  doing to starve those children to [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3333.14s)]
*  death, that'll be terrible for [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3334.98s)]
*  my beloved Israel. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3336.88s)]
*  Okay, Ben, focus, [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3337.9s)]
*  we were talking about Hollywood. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3338.98s)]
*  Okay, so he went on this tangent [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3341.14s)]
*  about how they gotta shut down [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3342.98s)]
*  TikTok, okay? [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3344.7400000000002s)]
*  So anyways, he might actually care [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3347.0s)]
*  more about this because Daily Wire [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3349.4s)]
*  they're making movies, [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3352.04s)]
*  which is crazy to me. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3353.88s)]
*  But okay, God bless. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3355.92s)]
*  And so it might affect his revenue, [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3357.2400000000002s)]
*  it might affect his business, and [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3359.52s)]
*  that's another reason why he might [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3361.6400000000003s)]
*  be upset about it. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3363.6600000000003s)]
*  So that doesn't mean he's wrong, [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3365.0s)]
*  the 100% tariff, nobody even knows [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3366.6000000000004s)]
*  what the hell that means, [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3368.46s)]
*  just Trump made that up. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3369.6800000000003s)]
*  So is that going to happen? [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3371.04s)]
*  No way, but for a second, [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3372.2400000000002s)]
*  the markets were worried. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3373.76s)]
*  So what happened? [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3375.46s)]
*  Netflix was down 4%, [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3376.3s)]
*  Disney down 3%, [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3377.66s)]
*  Warner Brothers Discovery down 5%, [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3378.94s)]
*  Paramount down 2%, [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3381.54s)]
*  Comcast down 1%. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3383.0s)]
*  But then they recovered, [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3384.38s)]
*  why did they recover? [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3385.94s)]
*  Not in their entirely necessarily, [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3387.34s)]
*  it's a mixed bag there for [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3389.54s)]
*  those stocks. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3391.18s)]
*  Because they realized, [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3393.14s)]
*  maybe we can get tax breaks out of [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3395.04s)]
*  this. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3397.42s)]
*  Because Trump was talking about [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3398.46s)]
*  a tariff that actually would hurt [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3400.02s)]
*  Hollywood. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3401.66s)]
*  That's why the stocks went down in [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3402.42s)]
*  the beginning. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3404.2s)]
*  Because wait, if we can't sell our [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3404.96s)]
*  movies in China, it was four times [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3406.8799999999997s)]
*  as many people in China as there is [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3408.7999999999997s)]
*  in America. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3410.56s)]
*  They don't want those tariffs, [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3411.68s)]
*  right? [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3413.16s)]
*  So a lot of consumers in the rest [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3413.72s)]
*  of the world that they want to be [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3415.12s)]
*  able to reach. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3416.3999999999996s)]
*  But when Voight started talking [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3417.16s)]
*  about tax breaks, everybody's like, [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3420.16s)]
*  tax breaks, tax breaks for [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3423.52s)]
*  corporations. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3425.8999999999996s)]
*  This is where everyone in politics [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3427.48s)]
*  is the line. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3429.68s)]
*  And you thought Trump was [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3431.3599999999997s)]
*  the ordinary guy that he's [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3432.54s)]
*  anti-establishment? [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3433.78s)]
*  No, he's just doing the same exact [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3434.74s)]
*  corporate tax cuts, etc. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3436.54s)]
*  That everybody else is doing. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3438.02s)]
*  So Governor Gavin Newsom from [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3438.98s)]
*  California, obviously, jumps in and [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3440.74s)]
*  goes, California built a film [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3443.14s)]
*  industry and we're ready to bring [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3445.18s)]
*  even more jobs home. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3447.22s)]
*  We've proven what strong state [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3448.5s)]
*  incentives can do. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3450.02s)]
*  Now it's time for [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3451.02s)]
*  a real federal partnership to make [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3451.78s)]
*  America film again. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3453.46s)]
*  POTUS, let's get it done. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3454.5s)]
*  So he's reaching out to Donald [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3456.38s)]
*  Trump enthusiastically. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3458.1s)]
*  So why is the Democratic [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3459.74s)]
*  governor of California doing that? [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3460.68s)]
*  Because they've decided they're [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3462.6s)]
*  going to push for a $7.5 billion [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3464.92s)]
*  tax credit to movie companies. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3467.72s)]
*  No, no, I'm a hard pass on that. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3470.6s)]
*  Why? [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3476.12s)]
*  Look, brothers, [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3477.2799999999997s)]
*  make movies that make money. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3478.48s)]
*  If you can't, [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3480.3999999999996s)]
*  that's your business, [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3481.12s)]
*  not my business. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3482.16s)]
*  I mean, I love the movies. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3483.3599999999997s)]
*  I love going to the movies and [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3484.3999999999996s)]
*  mainly I like the popcorn. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3486.12s)]
*  I know you guys are very surprised. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3488.08s)]
*  Okay, but it's not my, [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3491.0s)]
*  why am I financing giant movie [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3493.08s)]
*  companies? [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3495.72s)]
*  Because they take that money out of [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3497.72s)]
*  our paychecks. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3499.08s)]
*  No, I don't need any tax credit [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3500.2799999999997s)]
*  going to Hollywood. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3502.24s)]
*  I don't need it at all. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3503.48s)]
*  Not only do we not need the tariffs, [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3505.3999999999996s)]
*  we don't even know what tariffs [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3507.6s)]

*  So all this is junk. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3511.08s)]
*  It's because Trump's a child. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AHlwCC1Gu0&t=3513.92s)]
