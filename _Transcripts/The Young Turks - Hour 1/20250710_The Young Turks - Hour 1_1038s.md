"The federal response to the deadly flooding in Texas was hampered by a Department of Homeland Security policy implemented by Secretary Kristi Noem, CNN reported on Wednesday night.
Late last week, floodwaters from the Guadalupe River overwhelmed towns in parts of central Texas, where nearly 120 people have died in the flooding. CNN reported on Wednesday that officials at the Federal Emergency Management Agency sprang into action, but soon found their response hobbled by a new policy at DHS, which oversees FEMA. Per the new rule, the department‚Äôs secretary must personally sign off on all contracts or grants of more than $100,000."

# Kristi Noem Reportedly DELAYED THE FEMA Response In Texas
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [July 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA)
*  Because as the sun rises over [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=0.0s)]
*  Central Texas today, residents are [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=1.78s)]
*  still grieving the loss of at least [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=3.84s)]
*  120 people across six counties [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=5.72s)]
*  after storm surge through the [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=7.48s)]
*  region nearly one week ago. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  A desperate search by air, water, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=10.88s)]
*  land and even horseback continues [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=12.94s)]
*  at this hour. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=14.8s)]
*  As officials say, more than 170 [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=15.52s)]
*  people are still missing. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=17.32s)]
*  So as the death toll continues to [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=22.62s)]
*  rise following the deadly floods [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=24.44s)]
*  that hit Central Texas almost a week [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=26.16s)]
*  ago, new reporting reveals the [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=28.04s)]
*  federal response to the flooding [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=29.8s)]
*  was significantly delayed due to [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=31.64s)]
*  Christine Noam's new FEMA policies. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=33.64s)]
*  So Cenk, Woz and I talked about [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=36.64s)]
*  this story a little bit yesterday [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=38.28s)]
*  specifically about how Governor [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=40.2s)]
*  Abbott doesn't want to investigate [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=42.24s)]
*  what went wrong, where with the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  flood and the response to it. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=46.379999999999995s)]
*  Because according to him, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=48.08s)]
*  that is something that only losers [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=49.879999999999995s)]
*  do. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=52.120000000000005s)]
*  But this part of the story broke [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=52.879999999999995s)]
*  right before we went live yesterday. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=54.64s)]
*  So it turns out that as much as [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=56.28s)]
*  Abbott is insisting that no one is [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=58.02s)]
*  to blame for the inadequate [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=60.0s)]
*  response to the victims and [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=61.760000000000005s)]
*  the situation, there does seem to [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=63.6s)]
*  be some blame to be had. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=65.8s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=67.8s)]
*  Yeah, so no matter which political [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=68.84s)]
*  party, whenever a politician says [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=70.64s)]
*  we shouldn't investigate this, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=72.52000000000001s)]
*  that means you should [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=74.24000000000001s)]
*  investigate it. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=75.36s)]
*  He's definitely trying to hide [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=76.36s)]
*  something. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=77.64s)]
*  And look at that, when there was [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=78.24000000000001s)]
*  wildfires in California, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=79.76s)]
*  they were like, Karen Bass, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=81.04s)]
*  Gavin Newsom, we need [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=82.58s)]
*  investigations, this is our [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=83.56s)]
*  problem as ever. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=84.96s)]
*  It happens in Texas, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=86.69999999999999s)]
*  they're like shh. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=87.83999999999999s)]
*  No investigations, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=90.16s)]
*  don't look into it at all. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=91.0s)]
*  Well, it turns out because the [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=92.36s)]
*  minute you look into it, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=93.96s)]
*  you find out, my God, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=95.24s)]
*  it was Kristi Noem's fault. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=96.39999999999999s)]
*  So I was not inclined in that [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=98.47999999999999s)]
*  direction, that's why I'm actually [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=99.83999999999999s)]
*  a bit shocked at how brazen and [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=101.88s)]
*  over the top this story is. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=103.75999999999999s)]
*  Because it was definitely her fault [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=105.47999999999999s)]
*  that they didn't get there in time. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=107.52s)]
*  They're going to ruin FEMA. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=109.72s)]
*  It was one of the, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=111.8s)]
*  I know that you heard, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=112.6s)]
*  like if you're on the right, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=113.56s)]
*  propaganda about FEMA. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=114.84s)]
*  No, no, it was one of the few [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=118.44s)]
*  things in government that was [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=120.03999999999999s)]
*  working. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=121.64s)]
*  So watch how they're [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=122.52s)]
*  destroying it now. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=123.52s)]
*  Yeah, the story really is [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=125.24s)]
*  egregious. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=126.66s)]
*  So according to four FEMA officials [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=127.32s)]
*  who spoke to CNN yesterday, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=129.6s)]
*  FEMA was not allowed to deploy [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=131.56s)]
*  their urban search and [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=133.56s)]
*  rescue crews until they got [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=135.07999999999998s)]
*  the sign off from Homeland Security [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=136.92s)]
*  Secretary Kristi Noem, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=139.32s)]
*  which did not come until Monday, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=140.96s)]
*  two hours after the flooding began. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=143.2s)]
*  So last month, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=145.72s)]
*  CNN reported that Kristi Noem [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=146.76s)]
*  enacted a new rule stating that [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=148.68s)]
*  every contract and [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=150.72s)]
*  grant over $100,000 across [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=152.04s)]
*  her department must get her personal [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=154.12s)]
*  sign off in order for any of those [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=156.68s)]
*  funds to be released. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=158.8s)]
*  So this is from CNN, says, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=160.51999999999998s)]
*  officials inside FEMA warned [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=162.4s)]
*  the new approval process could [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=164.44s)]
*  severely disrupt the distribution [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=166.44s)]
*  of emergency funds during natural [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=168.72s)]
*  disasters, with hurricane season [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=170.88s)]
*  underway, multiple sources told [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=173.08s)]
*  CNN that Noem's policy threatens to [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=175.52s)]
*  bog down FEMA's rapid response [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=177.96s)]
*  efforts and could choke off [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=180.20000000000002s)]
*  critical aid when every second [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=182.14000000000001s)]
*  counts. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=184.28s)]
*  One FEMA official directly involved [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=184.88000000000002s)]
*  in disaster response called [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=187.32000000000002s)]
*  the policy a dramatic and [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=189.28s)]
*  unprecedented overreach and [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=190.96s)]
*  contends that Noem is effectively [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=193.06s)]
*  preventing the department from [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=195.32000000000002s)]
*  functioning. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=197.52s)]
*  So they also added that this will [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=198.64000000000001s)]
*  hurt nonprofits, states and [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=200.72000000000003s)]
*  small towns, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=202.72s)]
*  massive delays feel inevitable. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=203.76s)]
*  So for FEMA, disaster response can [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=206.64s)]
*  regularly soar into the billions [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=209.04s)]
*  due to their contracts with crews [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=211.3s)]
*  who are working on the ground. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=213.48s)]
*  So a $100,000 threshold is pennies, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=215.44s)]
*  it's peanuts, they can hit that [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=218.0s)]
*  threshold very, very quickly once [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=220.07999999999998s)]
*  a disaster has occurred. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=222.4s)]
*  And it's no surprise that they were [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=224.32s)]
*  right about all of these delays. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=226.16s)]
*  So for example, as central Texas [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=228.2s)]
*  towns were submerged in rising [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=230.2s)]

*  this situation. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=432.5s)]

*  Luckily, Texas was able to handle [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=434.94s)]

*  disaster largely on its own and [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=446.9s)]

*  More than 2,100 people have been [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=454.14s)]

*  So, Cenk, people were actively [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=461.86s)]

*  But Cenk, what do you think about [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=523.94s)]
*  her overall response to this, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=525.62s)]
*  not just her lack of accountability, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=527.1800000000001s)]
*  but also the state versus federal [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=529.1800000000001s)]
*  government issue? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=530.9s)]
*  Yeah, so the river rises 20 feet [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=531.98s)]
*  in an hour, then they have to wait [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=534.94s)]
*  71 more hours for her to approve [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=537.98s)]
*  any spending over $100,000. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=541.1800000000001s)]
*  You guys grasp how stupid that [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=545.66s)]
*  rule is, they spend billions in [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=547.46s)]
*  these FEMA recovery situations. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=549.58s)]
*  Especially one as severe as this [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=551.9s)]
*  where over 120 people died. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=553.6999999999999s)]
*  $100,000 for you and [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=555.42s)]
*  I is a lot of money. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=556.74s)]
*  But for FEMA, you can't do [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=558.06s)]
*  anything with $100,000. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=559.38s)]
*  That means she has to basically [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=560.74s)]
*  okay every single expenditure. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=562.8199999999999s)]
*  And it took her three [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=565.06s)]
*  interminable days. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=566.9s)]
*  It's unbelievable how long that is [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=568.8199999999999s)]
*  in an emergency. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=571.6999999999999s)]
*  It's just the worst judgment you've [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=573.3s)]
*  seen except there's one other thing [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=575.18s)]
*  that Noam did in her life that [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=576.98s)]
*  makes you go, right, right. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=578.5s)]
*  She's the one with the terrible [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=580.02s)]
*  judgment, I'll go back to that in [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=581.5s)]
*  a second. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=583.06s)]
*  But guys, so the Republicans have [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=583.78s)]
*  been doing propaganda against FEMA [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=585.66s)]
*  and with Kristi Noam here, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=587.78s)]
*  you're seeing that that propaganda [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=589.58s)]
*  doesn't make any sense. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=591.66s)]
*  It clashes with the other things [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=593.06s)]
*  that they're saying. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=595.38s)]
*  So what happened was, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=597.38s)]
*  whenever there's some sort of [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=598.82s)]
*  disaster in red states over [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=600.82s)]
*  the last, this is a recent [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=602.66s)]
*  phenomenon around when Trump [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=604.34s)]
*  started around ten years ago or so. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=606.3s)]
*  When it's in a red state, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=608.7s)]
*  which comes back from vacation three [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=610.0999999999999s)]
*  days later and they say, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=611.8199999999999s)]
*  we need all the money, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=613.06s)]
*  all the money comes to cover us [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=614.14s)]
*  right away, right away, FEMA, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=615.4599999999999s)]
*  FEMA, right? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=617.14s)]
*  And then in North Carolina, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=618.14s)]
*  for example, they started this [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=619.7399999999999s)]
*  thing about how FEMA is going to [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=621.3s)]
*  come to your house and [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=622.78s)]
*  do something bad to you. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=623.7399999999999s)]
*  And then a couple of FEMA people [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=625.02s)]
*  were like, I don't know if I want [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=626.5s)]
*  to go to Trump houses, they're all [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=628.02s)]
*  riled up to like, they're angry at [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=629.7399999999999s)]
*  us, I don't know if they're going [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=631.3399999999999s)]
*  to attack us, etc. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=632.78s)]
*  And they decided not to go to [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=633.66s)]
*  recall houses, that terrible [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=634.78s)]
*  decision, that's your job is to go [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=636.02s)]
*  help those people, right? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=637.4599999999999s)]
*  But then they take those microscopic [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=638.74s)]
*  cases and they're like, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=640.9000000000001s)]
*  that's it, FEMA's bad, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=642.38s)]
*  abolish FEMA. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=643.7800000000001s)]
*  And especially if it's in a blue [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=645.0600000000001s)]
*  state, a disaster happened, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=646.4200000000001s)]
*  Ted Cruz then comes out and say, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=647.6600000000001s)]
*  no way, not going to fund it, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=649.22s)]
*  no way. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=650.74s)]
*  Tommy Tuberville comes out and [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=651.7s)]
*  goes, blue states, who cares, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=653.1400000000001s)]
*  abolish FEMA. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=654.74s)]
*  And no, now he's talking about [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=656.1400000000001s)]
*  abolish FEMA, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=657.34s)]
*  you're in charge of FEMA. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=658.1800000000001s)]
*  And how can you say, FEMA, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=660.38s)]
*  under me, FEMA is perfectly [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=661.9000000000001s)]
*  responsive and awesome and [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=663.3000000000001s)]
*  terrific, and [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=664.74s)]
*  that's why we should get rid of it. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=665.38s)]
*  You're not even trying to make [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=666.98s)]
*  sense. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=669.82s)]
*  I mean, look, I was against defund [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=671.62s)]
*  the police, I was against abolish [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=673.34s)]
*  ICE, those are slogans that make [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=674.86s)]
*  you think that there's going to be [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=676.5s)]
*  no border control or no cops. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=678.1800000000001s)]
*  Now the Republicans are doing [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=680.1800000000001s)]
*  abolish FEMA. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=681.38s)]
*  And by the way, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=682.66s)]
*  they're literally doing it. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=683.22s)]
*  Those are like, hey, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=684.1800000000001s)]
*  we should reduce funding and [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=684.94s)]
*  give it to another organization, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=686.02s)]
*  etc, etc. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=687.54s)]
*  This is no, like no, not only do we [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=688.14s)]
*  think we should abolish FEMA, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=690.38s)]
*  if you're in Texas and 120 of you [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=692.54s)]
*  died, I'm going to wait 72 hours [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=694.98s)]
*  before I let them spend a dollar on [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=697.22s)]
*  you, because I don't really care [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=699.4200000000001s)]
*  about you guys. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=701.5s)]
*  Why did they even want to abolish [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=702.5s)]
*  FEMA? [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=704.22s)]
*  It's like, so yeah, it's had some [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=704.74s)]
*  terrible moments like Hurricane [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=706.7s)]
*  Katrina, etc. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=708.74s)]
*  But overall, there's a lot of [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=709.86s)]
*  emergencies these days, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=711.62s)]
*  natural disasters, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=713.1400000000001s)]
*  partly because of climate change. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=714.34s)]
*  And in my estimation, believe me, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=716.58s)]
*  I mean, if you watch [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=718.6600000000001s)]
*  the Young Turks at all, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=719.7s)]
*  I criticize a lot of government [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=721.0200000000001s)]
*  actions, right? [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=722.74s)]
*  But FEMA has been pretty good. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=724.3s)]
*  They get to the areas relatively [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=726.5s)]
*  quickly, normally, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=728.78s)]
*  they get people help right away. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=730.14s)]
*  It's one of the few things in [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=732.02s)]
*  government that actually works, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=733.3399999999999s)]
*  not perfectly, but pretty good, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=735.14s)]
*  right? [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=737.02s)]
*  So why did the Republicans even [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=738.5799999999999s)]
*  start an attack on FEMA? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=740.2199999999999s)]
*  because it only helps [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=741.8199999999999s)]
*  the average American. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=743.06s)]
*  It doesn't help any executives at [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=744.8199999999999s)]
*  all. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=746.66s)]
*  No corporate CEO is going to get [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=747.18s)]
*  rich off of FEMA. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=749.06s)]
*  No one has any special interests [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=750.18s)]
*  involved. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=752.18s)]
*  FEMA doesn't have any lobbies. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=753.4599999999999s)]
*  It usually helps poor and [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=754.9799999999999s)]
*  middle class people whose houses [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=756.18s)]
*  have been wiped out through [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=757.86s)]
*  a natural disaster. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=759.2199999999999s)]
*  The oil companies don't even like [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=760.4599999999999s)]
*  it, they don't like this talk of [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=761.66s)]
*  climate change and all that stuff, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=762.86s)]
*  right? [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=764.14s)]
*  So to the average American, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=764.66s)]
*  abolish FEMA. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=767.06s)]
*  State didn't even donate to us. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=769.2199999999999s)]
*  They're not even a corporation, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=771.26s)]
*  these people in Texas. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=773.14s)]
*  See, this is stupid and disgusting. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=774.74s)]
*  So finally, are we surprised that [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=777.2199999999999s)]
*  the woman who thought that [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=780.06s)]
*  not only will I murder a dog in [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=782.42s)]
*  a gravel pit, but I'll put it in [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=785.06s)]
*  my book so everyone knows about it. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=788.02s)]
*  Had the infinitely bad judgment to [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=791.74s)]
*  say, hey, you know what? [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=793.98s)]
*  In the case of emergencies, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=795.3s)]
*  you should wait 72 hours for [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=797.42s)]
*  me to authorize the tiniest little [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=799.5s)]
*  spending while everyone is dying. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=801.9s)]
*  No, not at all surprising, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=805.22s)]
*  clown through and through. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=806.82s)]
*  Yeah, I really don't understand [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=809.4200000000001s)]
*  that 72 hour response. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=811.5s)]
*  This thing was in the news way [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=813.7800000000001s)]
*  before that, right? [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=815.3000000000001s)]
*  I think the flooding started [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=816.46s)]
*  Thursday or Friday. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=817.9000000000001s)]
*  It was in the news the next day, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=819.14s)]
*  right? [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=820.6600000000001s)]
*  We knew what was going on, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=821.1800000000001s)]
*  especially here in Texas, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=822.5s)]
*  we knew what was going on. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=823.9000000000001s)]
*  There's no excuse for it. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=825.4200000000001s)]
*  There's no reason why something [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=827.22s)]
*  like this would take 72 hours, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=829.26s)]
*  especially as you spelled out, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=831.22s)]
*  it is such a small amount of money. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=833.46s)]
*  Why does that need to even be [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=835.94s)]
*  approved? [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=837.4200000000001s)]
*  If you see that there's flooding [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=838.3000000000001s)]
*  in Texas, just say, yeah, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=839.9s)]
*  have the money, whatever. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=841.22s)]
*  Also, you're right, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=843.26s)]
*  this is hurricane season. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=844.74s)]
*  We are here in Texas, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=846.78s)]
*  all along the Gulf Coast, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=847.94s)]
*  all along the East Coast. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=849.22s)]
*  Even on the West Coast now, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=850.7s)]
*  you guys are getting more [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=851.98s)]
*  hurricanes than before. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=853.02s)]
*  This is not great timing for [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=854.22s)]
*  any of this. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=855.78s)]
*  There's a lot of concern, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=856.58s)]
*  especially I know here in Houston, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=857.78s)]
*  it's a big concern that we're just [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=859.54s)]
*  not going to get the money or [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=861.34s)]
*  the aid that we need. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=862.74s)]
*  If and when these things happen and [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=863.98s)]
*  these things inevitably will [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=866.1s)]
*  happen, it's really just a matter [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=867.86s)]
*  of time as to when something's [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=869.98s)]
*  going to hit. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=872.02s)]
*  In the past, yeah, FEMA has been [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=872.94s)]
*  there to help people out whenever [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=874.9s)]
*  there's times of crisis. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=876.86s)]
*  It's like what you said, right? [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=878.86s)]
*  It's never perfect, right? [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=879.98s)]
*  But a lot of times it is the thing [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=881.5s)]
*  that gets people through, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=883.22s)]
*  it is the thing that gets [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=884.58s)]
*  the city through. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=885.74s)]
*  And in Texas, we do have what they [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=887.34s)]
*  say, one of the most robust [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=888.98s)]
*  emergency response systems [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=890.38s)]
*  in the country. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=891.9s)]
*  That is because we need it, right? [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=892.9s)]
*  We have a lot of weird weather here [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=894.26s)]
*  in Texas. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=896.26s)]
*  But at the same time, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=897.4599999999999s)]
*  we're not the federal government. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=898.5s)]
*  We don't have billions and [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=900.06s)]
*  billions of dollars to spend on, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=901.9799999999999s)]
*  if a hurricane hits, and [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=904.3399999999999s)]
*  that is how much it costs. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=905.86s)]
*  I think for Hurricane Harvey, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=907.2199999999999s)]
*  it was over $100 billion that it [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=909.02s)]
*  costs in recovery. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=911.0999999999999s)]
*  Also, on that note, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=913.38s)]
*  they also seem very hesitant to [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=914.74s)]
*  install any kind of preventative [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=916.8199999999999s)]
*  things that would be a lot cheaper. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=919.0999999999999s)]
*  But you can't justify that cost [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=921.78s)]
*  because $100,000, let's just say, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=923.98s)]
*  as an example, [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=926.82s)]
*  let's go with a million dollars, [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=927.66s)]
*  right? [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=929.02s)]
*  A million dollars of preventative [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=929.54s)]
*  money just feels like money you [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=931.3s)]
*  don't have to pay because there's [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=932.82s)]
*  no acute need for it. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=934.54s)]
*  But a hurricane comes, then it [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=935.66s)]
*  costs $125 billion. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=937.66s)]
*  I don't know, the numbers don't [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=939.3s)]
*  really make sense to me there. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=941.1800000000001s)]
*  Also in Kerr County, we did hear [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=943.1800000000001s)]
*  that there were calls from local [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=945.86s)]
*  officials in that area who were [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=948.54s)]
*  saying we need to do something [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=951.02s)]
*  about our emergency response and [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=953.3s)]
*  our flood response system because [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=955.78s)]
*  it is wildly obsolete or [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=958.22s)]
*  non-existent. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=959.9s)]
*  And that is one of the most flood [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=961.26s)]
*  prone areas in the entire state. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=963.1s)]
*  And they never got the funding for [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=965.38s)]
*  it and now we had this disaster [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=967.26s)]
*  happen and they were unable to [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=968.9s)]
*  respond the way they might have [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=970.62s)]
*  been able to. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=972.3s)]
*  Again, it is hard to point fingers [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=973.9s)]
*  because this thing happens so, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=976.4599999999999s)]
*  so rapidly. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=978.86s)]
*  It's very hard to wrap your head [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=979.98s)]
*  around and I saw a video of [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=981.78s)]
*  the river and it's just like, [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=983.5s)]
*  in my head and just how quickly the [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=985.42s)]
*  water was rising. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=987.38s)]
*  And you have to do everything you [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=988.34s)]
*  can in advance to prevent the [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=990.58s)]
*  absolute worst from happening and [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=992.54s)]
*  that's just simply not what we saw [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=994.9s)]
*  here today or last week. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdhDmIustZA&t=997.34s)]
