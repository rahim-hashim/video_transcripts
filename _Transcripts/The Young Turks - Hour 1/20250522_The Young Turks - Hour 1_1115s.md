"I‚Äôve obtained the alleged manifesto written by Elias Rodriguez, suspect in the killing of two Israeli Embassy staffers in Washington, DC on Wednesday.

I believe the document to be authentic for several reasons, including the fact that it is signed by Rodriguez and timestamped well before he was named by law enforcement or any media."

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful.

We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network.

*  In fact, before I get to [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=90.48s)]
*  the victims, I want to kind of go [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=91.67999999999999s)]
*  to you Cenk and get your initial [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=93.32s)]
*  thoughts on this pretty terrible [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=94.92s)]
*  story. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=96.72s)]
*  Yeah, so shooting is terrible, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=98.6s)]
*  immoral, counterproductive, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=101.0s)]
*  stupid. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=103.36s)]
*  Let me break down those one by one. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=104.8s)]
*  So first of all, if you think you're [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=106.84s)]
*  for peace and you kill people over [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=109.52s)]
*  it, you missed the memo. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=112.0s)]
*  You don't understand what [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=114.28s)]
*  the peace movement is at all. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=115.75999999999999s)]
*  And as he's yelling free, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=117.7s)]
*  free Palestine there, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=119.26s)]
*  I'm thinking shut up. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=120.62s)]
*  God, you couldn't do more damage in [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=122.14s)]
*  both directions. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=124.3s)]
*  First of all, to those innocent [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=125.5s)]
*  people that you murdered. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=127.22s)]
*  And then on top of that, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=129.02s)]
*  you put the entire Jewish [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=130.74s)]
*  community in America on edge and [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=132.46s)]
*  that is terrible for their own sake [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=134.62s)]
*  and their psyche and there are [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=136.9s)]
*  American brothers and sisters and [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=138.82s)]
*  you don't do that. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=140.98000000000002s)]
*  And so in this case, yes, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=142.34s)]
*  they're Israeli staffers, but [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=143.62s)]
*  you put the Jewish American [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=145.26s)]
*  community in a terrible situation [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=146.9s)]
*  and you're saying, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=148.9s)]
*  I don't understandably because of [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=150.14000000000001s)]
*  this and I hate that and [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=151.94s)]
*  I can't stand it. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=153.06s)]
*  We're supposed to be good guys. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=154.06s)]
*  And so this guy is not one of us. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=156.06s)]
*  We'll get to his stupid [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=159.06s)]
*  motivations in a second. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=160.98000000000002s)]
*  But then secondly, Anna, look, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=163.38s)]
*  how deeply counterproductive this [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=165.74s)]
*  stuff is maddening. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=168.18s)]
*  Yeah, I loathe people like this. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=169.98000000000002s)]
*  I loathe people like this. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=171.98000000000002s)]
*  I find them to be narcissistic, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=173.98000000000002s)]
*  being the perpetual underdogs and [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=176.5s)]
*  never succeeding in any damn thing. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=179.26s)]
*  And I say that because guess what? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=182.1s)]
*  You have a government right now [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=184.18s)]
*  that was already heeding the advice [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=186.54s)]
*  and the demands of the Israeli [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=189.22s)]
*  government in coming down hard on [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=191.5s)]
*  pro-peace pro-Palestinian [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=193.98s)]
*  protesters. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=196.1s)]
*  Okay, do you think the situation is [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=197.06s)]
*  going to get better now after this [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=199.38s)]
*  piece of crap decided to gun down [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=201.7s)]
*  two people in Washington DC? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=204.02s)]
*  Yeah, so look, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=206.74s)]
*  it hurts everyone in every way. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=208.06s)]
*  First, of course, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=210.46s)]
*  the number one victims are [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=211.5s)]
*  the victims, the people who were [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=212.82s)]
*  killed and they were about to get [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=214.38s)]
*  engaged. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=215.94s)]
*  The second set of victims are the [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=216.66s)]
*  people who are terrorized by that [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=218.7s)]
*  action. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=220.74s)]
*  And then the third set are the side [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=221.5s)]
*  that he thinks he's on, but [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=223.82s)]
*  I don't think he's on at all. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=225.78s)]
*  And it's an act of despicable [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=228.58s)]
*  selfishness. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=231.1s)]
*  Like in his sick mind, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=232.7s)]
*  he thinks I'm the hero. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=234.3s)]
*  I'm the one who would do murder on [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=236.42s)]
*  behalf of this cause. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=238.33999999999997s)]
*  And what does that do? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=239.82s)]
*  Now, we've been telling everybody [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=241.26s)]

*  Yaron had recently purchased [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=334.34s)]
*  a ring he was planning on [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=335.74s)]

*  will never get the opportunity to [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=338.3s)]
*  do so because they were gunned down [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=340.0s)]
*  last night. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=341.82s)]
*  One witness discussed how attendees [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=342.98s)]
*  of the event unwittingly provided [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=345.18s)]
*  aid to the shooter after he had [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=347.14s)]
*  gunned down two people. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=348.94s)]
*  And I want to go to that clip next, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=351.16s)]
*  take a look. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=352.62s)]
*  There was a man who came in and [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=354.34000000000003s)]
*  he's saying call the police and [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=356.34000000000003s)]
*  he's covered in rain and [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=358.66s)]
*  he looks very distressed. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=360.26s)]
*  And so we're trying to offer him [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=362.62s)]
*  some help and even one of my [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=365.5s)]
*  friends asks him, are you okay? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=367.98s)]
*  Can I get you some water? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=371.82s)]
*  And he's like, yeah, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=375.66s)]
*  actually that'd be great. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=376.58s)]
*  And I'm like, so [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=378.94s)]
*  do you like this museum? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=380.18s)]
*  And he's like kind of playing dumb [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=383.18s)]
*  with me. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=385.06s)]
*  He's like, what kind of museum is [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=385.7s)]
*  this? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=387.34000000000003s)]
*  And I'm like, it's a Jewish museum. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=387.84000000000003s)]
*  And he asks, do you think that's [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=390.54s)]
*  why they did it in reference to [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=392.74s)]
*  the gunshots we had heard? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=394.66s)]
*  And I was like, yeah, maybe, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=396.66s)]
*  I don't know, but I don't think so. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=399.02s)]
*  I hope not. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=401.82s)]
*  And that's when he reaches into his [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=403.78000000000003s)]
*  bag and pulls out a keffiyeh and [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=406.58s)]
*  says to me, I did it. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=409.02s)]
*  I did this for Gaza. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=410.86s)]
*  The police also shared that he had [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=413.02s)]
*  confessed to the murders and [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=416.9s)]
*  said that he did it on behalf of [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=420.18s)]
*  Palestine and what's happening in [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=423.26s)]
*  Gaza, so counterproductive, so [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=426.38s)]
*  stupid, accomplishes absolutely [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=429.46s)]
*  nothing. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=432.18s)]
*  Now, the suspect who's in custody, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=432.98s)]
*  as I mentioned earlier, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=435.18s)]

*  you are part of the problem. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=639.26s)]
*  Yeah, so first of all, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=642.14s)]
*  violence is always wrong, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=643.46s)]
*  especially if you're part of [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=644.86s)]
*  a peace movement. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=646.38s)]
*  And secondly, it's a sign of [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=647.34s)]
*  surrender and it's what I tell you [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=648.7s)]
*  guys every time they're shooting [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=650.42s)]
*  like this. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=652.02s)]
*  It's saying I'm so stupid, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=652.66s)]
*  I can't win this argument on my own [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=654.38s)]
*  and through- [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=656.42s)]
*  Strategy. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=657.38s)]
*  Strategy, exactly, political, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=658.46s)]
*  moral, rhetorical and [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=660.9s)]
*  every other way. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=662.5s)]
*  Now look guys, it's a super hard [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=663.66s)]
*  battle to win. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=665.18s)]
*  I understand that no one [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=666.02s)]
*  understands that better than we do. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=666.98s)]
*  We've been fighting this battle to [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=668.54s)]
*  peace to Gaza and to stop the [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=670.54s)]
*  slaughter, etc, right? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=672.14s)]
*  But giving up and [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=674.1s)]
*  then using violence just like [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=675.3s)]
*  the government of Israel is using [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=677.18s)]
*  now, how does that help? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=679.3s)]
*  No, it's a sign of surrender and [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=681.26s)]
*  I hate the weakness involved in [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=683.46s)]
*  that, let alone the immorality, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=685.62s)]
*  right? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=687.98s)]
*  So now second of all, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=688.86s)]
*  lumping in, so Jewish Americans [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=690.1s)]
*  with these folks is a thousand [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=692.3s)]
*  times wrong and we've said it [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=694.38s)]
*  a thousand times with the actions [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=696.38s)]
*  of a foreign government, right? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=698.86s)]
*  So while we say that a thousand [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=701.1800000000001s)]
*  times, I hope that people will also [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=702.94s)]
*  say lumping in Palestinians with [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=705.1s)]
*  this guy is also wrong. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=707.1800000000001s)]
*  All Palestinians didn't do [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=709.7s)]
*  this shooting, in fact, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=710.7800000000001s)]
*  no Palestinians did this shooting. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=711.7s)]
*  Lumping in all peace protesters [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=713.38s)]
*  with a guy who was violent makes [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=715.0600000000001s)]
*  no sense, but will mainstream media [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=716.6600000000001s)]
*  do both of those things, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=718.7s)]
*  overwhelmingly, over and [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=720.1400000000001s)]
*  over and over again? [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=721.82s)]
*  They will, from this day to [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=724.1400000000001s)]
*  the last day, pretend that this guy [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=725.86s)]
*  represents peace protesters and [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=727.94s)]
*  Palestinians, etc. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=729.86s)]
*  In fact, it's already all over [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=731.1800000000001s)]
*  media and every Israeli supporters [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=732.86s)]
*  on camera are going, we see we've [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=735.0600000000001s)]
*  got to do more violence against [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=737.0600000000001s)]
*  the Palestinians. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=738.94s)]
*  We'll get to that later in [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=740.74s)]
*  the program, some of the most [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=741.86s)]
*  disgusting things I've ever heard, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=743.1800000000001s)]
*  right? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=744.86s)]
*  So now, two things can be true at [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=745.3800000000001s)]
*  the same time. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=747.6600000000001s)]
*  So we've talked about the Armenian [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=749.86s)]
*  genocide many times before, right? [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=752.0200000000001s)]
*  And so after the Armenian genocide, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=754.34s)]
*  there was a string of terrorist [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=756.78s)]
*  acts by Armenians. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=758.94s)]
*  Now, some were directed at people [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=760.3s)]
*  who had committed the genocide, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=762.14s)]
*  like Israel went after some of [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=763.98s)]
*  the people who did the Holocaust. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=765.62s)]
*  And so a lot of people understand [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=767.74s)]
*  why that happened, right? [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=769.14s)]
*  But then, some of the radicals in [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=770.38s)]
*  that community kept going and [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=772.02s)]
*  they started killing Turkish [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=773.5s)]
*  diplomats all the way into [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=775.0600000000001s)]
*  the 1970s, right? [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=776.26s)]
*  And so that was a terrible thing to [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=777.58s)]
*  do, counterproductive, violent, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=779.3s)]
*  wrong. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=781.14s)]
*  Does that mean the Armenian [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=781.66s)]
*  genocide didn't happen? [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=782.82s)]
*  No, it doesn't mean that at all. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=783.98s)]
*  Two things can be true at [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=785.26s)]
*  the same time. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=786.3399999999999s)]
*  The Armenian genocide did happen and [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=787.02s)]
*  was terrible, and [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=789.06s)]
*  the terrorism was also terrible, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=790.02s)]
*  okay? [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=791.9399999999999s)]
*  And so in this case, is the slaughter [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=792.78s)]
*  and the genocide happening in Gaza? [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=794.8599999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=796.6999999999999s)]
*  Is this shooting terrible? [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=797.5799999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=798.8199999999999s)]
*  Both of those things are true at [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=800.0999999999999s)]
*  the same time, because what I'm [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=801.4599999999999s)]
*  seeing all over American media [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=802.9799999999999s)]
*  instantly as we expect it is, well, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=804.42s)]
*  since this guy, this one guy did [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=806.3399999999999s)]
*  this act of violence, you see why [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=808.26s)]
*  everyone in Gaza had it coming. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=810.38s)]
*  No, I don't see that at all. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=812.38s)]

*  Israel will use this viciously. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=915.46s)]

*  supposed to be? [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=934.74s)]

*  lead to a ceasefire? [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=938.7800000000001s)]
*  And by the way, Cenk, [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=940.7s)]
*  the one thing that I really want to [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=941.7800000000001s)]

*  have people like Pierce Morgan, [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=945.62s)]

*  we were all seeing in Gaza what it [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=950.0600000000001s)]

*  a genocide. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=954.1600000000001s)]
*  Just yesterday though, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=954.9s)]

*  you know what Mehdi, I now want to [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=959.1s)]
*  agree with you and [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=962.06s)]
*  he called it a genocide. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=963.06s)]

*  use violence to get your political [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=967.6999999999999s)]

*  a disastrous idea because it has [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=977.54s)]
*  consequences. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=979.74s)]
*  It's not like, okay, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=981.5s)]
*  what do you mean? [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=982.78s)]

*  not part of us, okay? [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=990.1s)]
*  Second of all, it doesn't matter [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=991.62s)]
*  what you think, it matters what [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=993.5400000000001s)]
*  the people in power think and [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=995.3000000000001s)]
*  can we move them or [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=996.82s)]
*  can we not move them? [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=997.74s)]
*  because whether we like it or not, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=999.02s)]
*  they're the ones making [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=1000.7s)]
*  the decisions. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=1001.82s)]
*  So we had made a great momentum and [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=1002.78s)]
*  in the most unfortunate, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=1005.1s)]
*  horrific ways because Israel is [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=1007.02s)]
*  literally starving 2 million people [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=1009.26s)]
*  right now as we speak. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=1011.82s)]
*  And so people were so horrified, [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=1013.0600000000001s)]
*  their consciences shocked by it. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=1015.3000000000001s)]
*  And then this moron comes along and [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=1017.86s)]
*  he's like, I'll kill two Israelis [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=1020.3000000000001s)]
*  in America. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=1022.74s)]
*  So now all those people, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=1024.06s)]
*  I guarantee you, look, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=1025.78s)]

*  them 800 times over. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=1031.34s)]
*  And what they'll try to say now and [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=1032.82s)]
*  I guarantee you it's on all over [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=1034.6200000000001s)]
*  TV right now is, that's it, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=1036.26s)]
*  that's it. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=1037.82s)]
*  If you criticize Israel, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=1038.7s)]
*  you're just like this guy. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=1039.82s)]
*  That's exactly what they're doing [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=1041.06s)]
*  right now, go to social media. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=1042.3s)]
*  I mean, Barry Weiss is using these [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=1043.26s)]
*  two deaths, these two deaths, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=1045.46s)]
*  these two murders, okay, [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=1047.42s)]
*  as an excuse to try to censor [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=1049.06s)]
*  Americans in media who have been [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=1050.82s)]
*  critical of how Israel has been [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=1052.66s)]
*  prosecuted as well. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=1054.3799999999999s)]
*  Okay, let me ask Barry something [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=1055.5s)]
*  then, how about the 53,000 murders [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=1057.06s)]
*  that you celebrate and cheer every [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=1059.02s)]
*  day? [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=1060.94s)]
*  Does that mean we can silence you? [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=1061.46s)]
*  Because if two people getting killed [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=1063.5s)]
*  which is despicable, silence is [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=1065.46s)]
*  the great majority of Americans now [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=1067.26s)]
*  who are opposed to funding Israel's [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=1069.34s)]

*  people for murdering 53,000 people? [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=1073.58s)]
*  How about when you murdered over [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=1076.38s)]
*  16,000 children, are we allowed to [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=1078.46s)]
*  silence you then? [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=1080.8200000000002s)]
*  No, I don't want to silence you and [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=1081.9s)]

*  Same. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=1085.98s)]
*  Okay, so killing two people is [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=1086.5s)]
*  despicable, killing 53,000 people [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=1088.7s)]
*  including over 16,000 children, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=1091.38s)]
*  deeply, deeply despicable. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=1093.9s)]
*  And if you can't see that both of [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=1098.3400000000001s)]
*  those things are true, and [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=1100.02s)]
*  you think one of them is not true, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=1101.46s)]
*  I don't care which side you're on, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=1103.26s)]
*  there's something wrong with you. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3SWxWB_kE&t=1105.8200000000002s)]
