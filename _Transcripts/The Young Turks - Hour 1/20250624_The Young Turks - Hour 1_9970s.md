# Tara Palmeri Interview
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4)
*  MUSIC [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=0.0s)]
*  The nuclear material might not have been there. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=60.0s)]
*  Might not have been there. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=73.52s)]
*  All right, one of the young Turks, Cenk Ugranek, is here with you guys. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=104.52s)]
*  I feel better today because Trump has done some positive things today, which is a bit [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=124.47999999999999s)]
*  shocking. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=130.32s)]
*  So we'll see if it holds. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=131.32s)]
*  Brace for impact. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=133.08s)]
*  Yeah, I know, my God. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=134.08s)]
*  So I've been getting yelled at online all day. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=136.0s)]
*  So what's new? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=140.96s)]
*  I know, right? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=141.96s)]
*  You're saying that Trump enforcing a ceasefire against Israel is a good thing? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=142.96s)]
*  No, boo, we don't want Israel to have a ceasefire. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=148.24s)]
*  No, but wait, we do want Israel to comply with a ceasefire. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=152.48000000000002s)]
*  No, you have to hate Trump anyway. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=156.32000000000002s)]
*  Okay, all right. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=158.64000000000001s)]
*  Well, anyway, we'll adjudicate. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=159.64000000000001s)]
*  We'll sort that out, okay? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=160.84s)]
*  I think one of the best things that you can do to kind of understand this current political [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=162.56s)]
*  moment because a lot of things don't make sense if you're kind of operating based on [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=166.84s)]
*  the old partisan lens. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=172.23999999999998s)]
*  I wish that things were as cut and clear as they might have been in the early aughts, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=174.83999999999997s)]
*  but they're not. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=179.73999999999998s)]
*  They're not, and it's hard to make sense of how things are changing and realigning. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=180.73999999999998s)]
*  We'll talk about this tomorrow, so I have time to produce it. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=187.35999999999999s)]
*  Candice Owens was on Piers Morgan today for a one-on-one interview. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=190.08s)]
*  That interview blew my mind, okay, because everything she said was accurate. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=194.24s)]
*  Everything she said was true. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=199.36s)]
*  And everything she said is reminiscent of what you would hear from a left-wing show [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=201.08s)]
*  arguing against essentially aiding and abetting Israel in its genocide in Gaza, for instance. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=206.12s)]
*  Yeah, so I'll say it. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=212.44s)]
*  They had a whole giant Piers Morgan episode about this massive split in MAGA. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=214.0s)]
*  But I went on Kyle and Crystal just a couple of days ago, and they think there's no split [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=218.8s)]
*  at all. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=222.56s)]
*  No, there's definitely a split, right? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=223.56s)]
*  I mean, but that's what they said. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=224.56s)]
*  So I don't know if they're on this planet. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=226.96s)]
*  And when I asked them if they're on this planet, they seem to get mad. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=228.96s)]
*  And by the way, to be fair to them, they're representing their audience. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=233.84s)]
*  And their audience doesn't see it at all. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=237.48000000000002s)]
*  That's because they're not getting accurate information. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=239.92000000000002s)]
*  If you think there's no MAGA split in the country, you're a little cuckoo for Cocoa [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=243.08s)]
*  Puffs. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=247.28s)]
*  But I wouldn't say they're not getting accurate information. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=248.28s)]
*  I trust that Crystal and Kyle are giving accurate information. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=250.6s)]
*  I just mean in general. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=253.04s)]
*  Hold on, but what I think is an issue, and I was guilty of this. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=254.44s)]
*  This was an issue that I had in the way that I was covering stories of some years ago. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=259.0s)]
*  It's that you end up in a bubble and you don't even realize it, right? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=264.36s)]
*  That's definitely right. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=268.08s)]
*  And when you're in that bubble, there's certain information that's not getting to you. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=269.08s)]
*  You have to literally actively seek it out because of these algorithms serving up what [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=273.68s)]
*  the algorithm thinks you wanna know or thinks you wanna see. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=278.28000000000003s)]
*  And so it doesn't mean that you have to agree with everything that Candace Owens believes [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=282.08s)]
*  in. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=286.84000000000003s)]
*  Obviously we don't, but that interview was fire. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=287.84000000000003s)]
*  Everything she said in that interview was correct. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=291.6s)]
*  And if you can't give her credit for saying things that we on the left believe, you really [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=293.7s)]
*  have to ask yourself, how are you operating? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=298.96000000000004s)]
*  Are you operating based on supporting a specific tribe no matter what? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=301.04s)]
*  Yes, that's definitely what they're doing. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=306.0s)]
*  And if you do that, well then you're not driven by policy. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=307.40000000000003s)]
*  You're not driven by actually accomplishing the policies that we think will make the country [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=310.22s)]
*  better. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=314.32000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, look, it's not about Kyle and Crystal at all. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=315.32000000000005s)]
*  I mean, oftentimes, I think sometimes these days, it used to be oftentimes, they're usually [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=317.0s)]
*  among the more reasonable. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=322.8s)]
*  But these days, if you're on the left and you're watching any of the other shows, you're [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=325.56s)]
*  not getting accurate information at all. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=331.08s)]
*  They're telling you that the actual Trump voters are liars and they love war. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=333.4s)]
*  That's not true at all, right? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=338.8s)]
*  So some of the Trump voters will do whatever Trump wants, but a lot of them are actually [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=340.4s)]
*  into war. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=345.44s)]
*  And they're making it seem like almost all the other left wing shows, as if the most [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=346.56s)]
*  extreme Maggots guy represents all 77 million Trump voters. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=350.66s)]
*  And if you believe that, then you'll hate them. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=355.0s)]
*  Of course, you'll wanna call them fascists and racists and Nazis and all those things. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=356.96s)]
*  But that's maniacal. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=361.64s)]
*  No, as you get closer to the middle, there's a lot of former Obama voters, former Bernie [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=363.56s)]
*  voters, anti-war voters, anti-establishment voters. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=370.4s)]
*  And almost none of the other left wing shows are acknowledging that. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=374.4s)]
*  They're out in la la land. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=377.08s)]
*  And honestly, yes, most of the other left wing shows are totally lying to their audience. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=378.58s)]
*  And they're saying, no, no, no, there's no split. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=383.8s)]
*  They all will do whatever Trump wants. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=386.2s)]
*  They're all the same voter. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=388.28000000000003s)]
*  They're all hardcore Magga and they're all fascist. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=389.84000000000003s)]
*  And by the way, as Kyle pointed at me and said, yes or no, is Magga fascist? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=392.36s)]
*  Well, what an asinine question. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=398.16s)]
*  What do you mean by Magga? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=400.34000000000003s)]
*  And do you mean Trump voters? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=402.40000000000003s)]
*  Cuz no, not all Trump voters are fascist. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=403.64s)]
*  But if you say that on another left wing show, they'll lose their minds. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=405.94s)]
*  They'll say, no, you have to call them fascists. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=409.6s)]
*  I'm the purest, I'm the purest, I'm the most left. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=411.56s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=414.28000000000003s)]
*  Give me clicks, give me clicks. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=415.28000000000003s)]
*  I'm not interested in getting into the business of other shows and how they conduct business. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=416.6s)]
*  You do you boo, right? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=422.24s)]
*  But look, I think, I just think that there is an interesting dynamic at play when Breaking [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=423.4s)]
*  Points for instance, which I love. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=432.28s)]
*  I listen to and watch Breaking Points almost on a daily basis at this point. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=433.98s)]
*  Crystal knows better than anyone. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=438.4s)]
*  Sagar and Jettie is very critical of going to war in Iran, very critical. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=439.76s)]
*  He's not a left winger. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=446.2s)]
*  Yeah, how could you possibly say there isn't a split? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=447.2s)]
*  How could you possibly say that? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=449.65999999999997s)]
*  And what they'll do, I swear to God and I know it, they'll move the goalposts. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=451.56s)]
*  So look, you can look at it. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=455.56s)]
*  We put the interview up on tyt.com slash press. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=457.2s)]
*  And as you watch it, I just want you to notice what happens, right? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=459.71999999999997s)]
*  I say I don't agree with Trump. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=464.78s)]
*  And I say, but I think we can get some of the Trump voters. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=466.76s)]
*  Honestly, they're not listening at all. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=470.48s)]
*  Then they just go back to, so here's what's wrong with Trump. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=472.96s)]
*  And I'm like, yeah, I agree. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=475.8s)]
*  That's what's wrong with Trump. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=478.03999999999996s)]
*  So let's talk about how to get the voters in the middle. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=479.42s)]
*  They're like, okay, now here's what's wrong with Trump. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=481.32s)]
*  So I get frustrated. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=484.4s)]
*  I'm like, wait, are we having the same conversation here? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=485.4s)]
*  And so part of that is framing it as we're tougher and meaner on Trump voters. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=489.36s)]
*  We got them, right? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=494.8s)]
*  Cenk, look at him being soft on Trump voters. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=496.72s)]
*  That's not a real leftist. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=500.16s)]
*  And as Kyle said, look, man, I don't catch- [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=502.68s)]
*  Well, I mean, you're not a leftist, number one. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=504.72s)]
*  Yeah, right, but I'm on the left. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=506.96000000000004s)]
*  I'm massively on the left, right? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=509.52000000000004s)]
*  And leftists don't represent the majority of the left. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=511.92s)]
*  I mean, whatever words we use, right? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=515.16s)]
*  Radical left, whatever. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=517.0s)]
*  They're a small sliver, right? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=518.6800000000001s)]
*  But they always make it seem like we're the true left. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=520.88s)]
*  Well, the polling doesn't indicate that at all, at all, okay? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=523.64s)]
*  So Kyle was like, yeah, you're coddling. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=528.64s)]
*  How many use some profane language, etc.? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=531.5999999999999s)]
*  I'm okay, I'm a grown up. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=534.64s)]
*  That's fine, I don't care, right? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=535.8s)]
*  But by the way, if I said that to Kyle and I said, you know what? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=537.3199999999999s)]
*  By helping Trump and [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=541.5999999999999s)]
*  Magna win elections by driving away their voters, driving away the voters that are [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=543.64s)]
*  anti-war, anti-establishment in the middle, you're coddling their balls, Kyle. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=548.2399999999999s)]
*  Okay, it's okay, we're all adults here, right? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=552.8s)]
*  That's what he said. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=555.16s)]
*  But if I said that to him in the middle, I bet you he would have been super mad. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=556.24s)]
*  Is that how you call the balls? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=559.48s)]
*  I don't know, I think he did it that way. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=561.0s)]
*  I don't have enough experience with it. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=564.08s)]
*  Kyle seemed to demonstrate it pretty accurate, I guess. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=565.76s)]
*  Anyway, seriously guys, look, it is what it is. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=568.68s)]
*  We have differences of opinion these days. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=570.72s)]
*  I'm not saying cancel them, don't watch them. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=572.84s)]
*  I mean, and I just told you she watches Breaking Points. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=575.8s)]
*  I go on Breaking Points, I have these conversations. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=578.76s)]
*  I'm trying to have conversations where we discuss what is the best strategy to take [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=582.1600000000001s)]
*  power away from Trump and bring those anti-establishment, anti-war, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=587.76s)]
*  anti-corruption voters to our side. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=594.1600000000001s)]
*  And by our side, I don't mean establishment Democrat. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=597.36s)]
*  If you're going to go in that direction, they're never going to say yes. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=599.32s)]
*  And by the way, I also don't mean radical left, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=601.76s)]
*  because if you go in that direction, they're never going to say yes. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=603.5200000000001s)]
*  But if you go populist left, Cor Bernie, economic populism, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=606.72s)]
*  they will say yes. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=611.08s)]
*  So please, it's not about watch this show or that show, watch all the shows, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=612.4000000000001s)]
*  get all of the opinions, okay? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=616.48s)]
*  Make sure you're getting the facts. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=618.5600000000001s)]
*  And at the end of the day, think through, okay, it's easy for [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=620.44s)]
*  me to get tribal and say, I hate those guys. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=623.8000000000001s)]
*  That's an easy thing. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=628.08s)]
*  And by the way, Kyle said, you used to do that, and [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=629.2s)]
*  some of you guys wrote in yesterday and stuff. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=631.64s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, first of all, I do it to their politicians all the time. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=633.6800000000001s)]
*  You fight up, you look up, you fight the politicians, okay? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=636.4000000000001s)]
*  That's the difference. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=639.76s)]
*  I want to emphasize that. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=640.72s)]
*  I want to say it again, because people keep conflating [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=643.2s)]
*  the politicians with the voters. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=646.28s)]
*  I'm not interested in attacking voters. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=648.52s)]
*  I am interested in attacking the politicians. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=650.28s)]
*  Bingo. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=652.84s)]
*  And by the way, and look, Chris and [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=653.52s)]
*  Kyle are pretty good on this, not some of the other shows, but [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=655.28s)]
*  also holding the Democrats accountable, right? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=658.52s)]
*  Because if you don't hold the Democrats accountable, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=661.04s)]
*  you got no credibility. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=662.56s)]
*  So yeah, the Republicans are terrible and they're all the devil. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=663.64s)]
*  But the Democrats and [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=666.4399999999999s)]
*  Kamala Harris run perfect campaigns and Joe Biden's a saint. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=667.3199999999999s)]
*  You gotta be kidding me, no way. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=670.16s)]
*  But luckily, most people have moved on past that, right? [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=671.92s)]
*  And they were never in that camp in the first place. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=674.0s)]
*  So look, look around, watch everything, and [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=676.12s)]
*  then see what do you think is the better strategy? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=679.92s)]
*  And Kyle said that the better strategy and repeated online throughout is, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=682.4s)]
*  we're going to win the left and liberals and then win the left. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=686.4399999999999s)]
*  But that's what we've been trying to do and [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=690.24s)]
*  we just lost twice to Trump doing that same exact strategy. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=692.24s)]
*  You have to win the anti-establishment voters. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=696.36s)]
*  You do that through populist left. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=700.52s)]
*  I don't even think Kyle and Crystal would disagree with that. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=702.36s)]
*  I don't know if some of the radicals or the establishment guys will [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=705.12s)]
*  certainly disagree. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=708.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=709.6s)]
*  Maybe some of the radicals will disagree because you can't ever agree with [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=710.12s)]
*  anyone on the other side about anything, right? [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=714.24s)]
*  But overall, please use your mind. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=717.2s)]
*  Please, by that I don't mean it like in a derogatory way. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=719.36s)]
*  Use your own independent judgment. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=722.6s)]
*  Don't take my word for it. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=724.32s)]
*  Don't take Kyle's word for it. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=725.48s)]
*  Don't take Randall's word for it, okay? [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=726.6400000000001s)]
*  Think through what is the best strategy. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=728.8800000000001s)]
*  Is the best strategy to call the other voters fascist and drive them away? [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=731.1600000000001s)]
*  Or is the better strategy say, hey, if you actually do agree with us, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=735.8800000000001s)]
*  we're not going towards you, they're coming towards us. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=739.6s)]
*  Anti-establishment, anti-war, anti-corruption, then great, you're welcome. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=741.9200000000001s)]
*  Welcome to come here. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=747.2800000000001s)]
*  And I say that about the young Turks. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=748.24s)]
*  Yeah, if you're an independent voter and you believe in populism and [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=749.9200000000001s)]
*  you actually meant all those things, you are definitely welcome here. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=753.4s)]
*  And go ask the other left wing shows, are they welcome? [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=757.0s)]
*  Now that I've stated it this way, they'll seem like jackasses if they say they're [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=760.04s)]
*  not. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=763.16s)]
*  So they might pretend that they are, but every single day they're like, fascist, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=763.6800000000001s)]
*  go away, go away fascist, don't vote left, don't support the left. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=768.24s)]
*  Well, if you do that, yeah, they're not going to support the left, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=771.96s)]
*  they're going to go away just like you told them to. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=774.52s)]
*  One of the things that Candace Owens said today, and look, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=776.24s)]
*  it takes balls to say this. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=779.9200000000001s)]
*  I don't think I have the balls to say it, but she literally said, no, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=781.68s)]
*  I don't want regime change in, I think we should have a talk about regime change [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=785.3199999999999s)]
*  in Israel. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=789.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=790.4399999999999s)]
*  And then she talked about how she believes that Israel has carried out more [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=791.76s)]
*  terroristic acts than Iran has, which look, yeah, that was strong. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=796.4s)]
*  But my point is, she is willing to look at the broader picture, right? [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=801.56s)]
*  Not just what's happening at this moment, but [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=807.12s)]
*  historically with the formation of Israel, the wars that have been fought [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=810.16s)]
*  on behalf of Israel, and she's calling it like she's seeing it. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=815.44s)]
*  And so if there is a contingent of Trump voters, and she did vote for Trump and [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=819.2s)]
*  now she's speaking out against him because of what happened in Iran with [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=824.08s)]
*  the bombing of the nuclear sites and all that. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=828.44s)]
*  If there's a contingent on the right that consists of this anti-war ideology, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=831.2s)]
*  on the topic of preventing wars, I will work with them. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=837.76s)]
*  I will work with them, period. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=843.9200000000001s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=845.6s)]
*  I don't care if they're right wingers. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=846.32s)]
*  If they are legitimate in being anti-war, not wanting to engage in regime change [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=847.76s)]
*  on that specific issue, yes, I will work with them. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=852.96s)]
*  You want to know why? [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=856.8000000000001s)]
*  Because preventing war, to me, is more important than being pure to the left. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=857.8000000000001s)]
*  I don't care about the left. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=863.0400000000001s)]
*  I don't care about the right. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=864.4s)]
*  I care about results. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=865.64s)]
*  And I'm sorry, this false dichotomy, this BS like tribalism, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=866.92s)]
*  has only hurt the country. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=871.8s)]
*  On areas where we can work together, we should work together. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=874.28s)]
*  And I do think that there's a contingent on the right, voters and yes, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=877.0s)]
*  a few media folks who are sick of the regime change wars. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=880.88s)]
*  They're sick of the forever wars, and they're not full of crap, okay? [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=884.6s)]
*  Because they literally say things publicly that could ruin them, but [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=887.8s)]
*  they say it anyway. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=891.52s)]
*  Yeah, so look, a couple things here. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=892.64s)]
*  So on that interview, there was times where Candice went too far. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=894.96s)]
*  Yes, supporting Kanye West and all that nasty shit. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=899.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't even get to that part. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=901.84s)]
*  No, that's a disaster. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=903.08s)]
*  And even when she says, I want regime change in Israel, and [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=904.88s)]
*  Piers says, yeah, I mean, we should get rid of Netanyahu, also good so far. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=907.68s)]
*  And then she later talked about using the military in the context of Israel. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=911.68s)]
*  And I'm like, okay, bring it down, okay? [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=916.24s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=918.4399999999999s)]
*  Okay, so now having said that, she's saying some of the things that we on the left, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=919.24s)]
*  me, Amy Goodman, Bernie Sanders have been saying for 20 years. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=924.2800000000001s)]
*  But we couldn't get anybody to pay attention, and [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=928.6400000000001s)]
*  this sucks about American media. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=930.24s)]
*  It's super toxic about American media, but it's true. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=932.0400000000001s)]
*  If you say it on the left, they're never going to pay attention. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=935.96s)]
*  The minute anyone on the right says, they're like, [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=938.6800000000001s)]
*  that's such an interesting point. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=941.1600000000001s)]
*  You know what? [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=943.72s)]
*  And we'll talk about it later in the show. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=944.72s)]
*  Tom Massey, Candace Owens, when they say, hey, what has Israel done for us? [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=946.04s)]
*  We've been asking that question for 20 years on the left, and [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=951.24s)]
*  nobody paid attention. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=954.36s)]
*  The minute those two ask the question, the American media is like, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=955.16s)]
*  wait a minute, that is a provocative question. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=958.6s)]
*  What has Israel done for us, right? [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=961.76s)]
*  And the answer is zero, nothing, nothing. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=964.2s)]
*  They've taken, taken, started wars, etc. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=966.24s)]
*  So okay, guys, this is last thing here, simple concept. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=968.92s)]
*  But it hasn't been treated as a simple concept. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=974.12s)]
*  You can agree with some things and [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=976.8s)]
*  disagree with other things about a person. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=979.1999999999999s)]
*  And I'm saying it like I'm almost being patronizing, right? [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=982.28s)]
*  I get it. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=986.4399999999999s)]
*  But that's because so many people say back, no, you can't. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=987.28s)]
*  You either have to be 100% for Trump or 100% against Trump. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=991.4399999999999s)]
*  Same thing for Candace Owens, Tucker Carlson, etc. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=995.3199999999999s)]
*  If you even give them credit on a thing where they're agreeing with you, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=998.04s)]
*  no, that's toxic, terrible, normalizes, blah, blah, blah. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1002.0s)]
*  They make up a bunch of words. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1006.36s)]
*  So you're legitimizing, platforming. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1008.0s)]
*  There's no normalizing, okay? [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1009.5600000000001s)]
*  Candace Owens, it has been normalized, okay? [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1011.6800000000001s)]
*  She has a massive audience, massive platform. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1014.1600000000001s)]
*  There's nothing Cenk and [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1017.5600000000001s)]
*  I can do that further normalizes Candace Owens. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1019.0400000000001s)]
*  She's wildly popular. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1021.6800000000001s)]
*  No, it goes to a super arrogant sense of entitlement that I think actually comes [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1023.6s)]
*  more from the establishment Democrats. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1027.56s)]
*  And it was perfectly illustrated in the Kamala Harris, [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1030.24s)]
*  Joe Rogan situation. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1033.16s)]
*  They're like, Kamala shouldn't go on. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1034.76s)]
*  It would normalize, it would platform Joe Rogan. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1036.52s)]
*  He has 39 million subscribers. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1039.8400000000001s)]
*  He would literally be platforming Kamala Harris, not the other way around. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1042.5600000000002s)]
*  And they're like, no, don't do it. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1047.8000000000002s)]
*  No, but then you're stuck in your own little cave and nobody's platforming you and [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1049.92s)]
*  you're like, I haven't platformed anyone. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1054.24s)]
*  Yeah, that's why no one have heard from you. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1056.28s)]
*  Okay, so he's giving you an opportunity to make your case. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1057.92s)]
*  And that's another thing I was surprised by. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1061.76s)]
*  I thought that they would see the bro shows are an open rebellion, right? [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1063.3200000000002s)]
*  Rogan again today, beating up Trump on immigration, not even the wars, right? [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1068.24s)]
*  Tim Dillon, Theo Vaughn massively beating up Israel and saying, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1073.44s)]
*  what are they doing for us and get out of the wars, etc. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1077.6000000000001s)]
*  I'm like, and they're like, nope, I don't see it. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1079.72s)]
*  And they said that Rogan was like, I don't know, I don't want to paraphrase. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1081.76s)]
*  You can watch the interview for yourself tyt.com slash press. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1085.4s)]
*  But he put Rogan in the same batch as Maga, I believe. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1089.5600000000002s)]
*  I'm like, no, no, no, [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1093.64s)]
*  Rogan has a whole bunch of right wing positions I don't agree with. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1094.92s)]
*  But he's not Maga, that's a different category. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1099.0s)]
*  He's in the bro sphere. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1102.0800000000002s)]
*  They're more independent, they're not in that same category. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1103.48s)]
*  They agree, there's a lot of overlap, right? [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1108.0800000000002s)]
*  But on war, and even on immigration, he's like, [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1110.52s)]
*  why are they kidnapping people off the streets in the middle of the country, right? [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1113.6s)]
*  He's actually been good on the topic of immigration. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1116.28s)]
*  I remember Rogan got a lot of backlash in Trump's first term because he hated [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1119.24s)]
*  Trump's immigration policies and spoke out against it. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1124.32s)]
*  So look, I think Americans are a lot more complicated and [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1127.9599999999998s)]
*  complex than all left or all right. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1132.08s)]
*  I think most people are a mix of some conservative views, some liberal views, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1134.9599999999998s)]
*  some far left views, some far right views. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1141.04s)]
*  It's a mix. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1143.68s)]
*  Ordinary people are a hodgepodge of political views. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1144.64s)]
*  And so I think the issue that I have in general is this effort or [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1148.0s)]
*  this obsession to impugn people's character based on their views on one issue or [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1153.36s)]
*  their opinion on one issue or the other. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1160.36s)]
*  Or which side they're on. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1162.68s)]
*  Or which side they're on, yeah. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1163.84s)]
*  It's just pure, pure tribalism. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1164.84s)]
*  It's like tribalism crack. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1167.12s)]
*  So you know you're on tribalism crack when the other side comes to you and [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1169.1599999999999s)]
*  you reject them. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1174.0s)]
*  We're not going to them. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1176.1999999999998s)]
*  They're like, you're doing the strategy Kamala Harris and [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1177.4799999999998s)]
*  Joe Biden did where they tried to get Republicans in the suburbs. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1179.8s)]
*  No, they did that strategy by wrapping their arms around Dick Cheney, [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1182.7199999999998s)]
*  Liz Cheney, and conservative corporatist positions. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1187.36s)]
*  That's a terrible strategy. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1191.2399999999998s)]
*  No, but when the other side comes to you and goes, you're right, [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1193.2399999999998s)]
*  we're anti-war, you're right, we like the idea of anti-corruption. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1195.84s)]
*  Yeah, you could say, hey, you picked the wrong guy for that, Donald Trump. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1198.8s)]
*  But the right guy is Bernie Sanders and others. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1201.9199999999998s)]
*  You could have that conversation like grownups and like human beings, or [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1203.84s)]
*  you could do what a lot of the other left is doing. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1207.6s)]
*  Fascist, wrong tribe, I hate you, right? [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1209.96s)]
*  Well, then that brother isn't going to have a conversation with you. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1214.72s)]
*  Right. And he's not going to come to your side. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1217.3999999999999s)]
*  Again, I find it so obvious, but yet there is a real massive school of [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1219.8799999999999s)]
*  thought that says, no, don't try to get those voters to come to your side. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1226.28s)]
*  Call them evil and shun them. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1231.32s)]
*  And shun Rogan when he agrees with you, shun Candace Owens, shun Tucker, [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1234.68s)]
*  shun all of them, even when they take positions that weren't like textbook, [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1238.72s)]
*  left-wing anti-war positions, right? [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1243.64s)]
*  Yeah, look, guys. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1245.76s)]
*  And that's just, to me, that's mental. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1246.48s)]
*  But if you think that makes sense, okay, good, [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1248.48s)]
*  there's tons of left-wing shows that are doing that. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1250.6s)]
*  You'll be thrilled. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1253.0s)]
*  You'll go on there and they'll just, they agreed with us. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1254.04s)]
*  They're liars. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1257.16s)]
*  They're fascists. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1258.52s)]
*  We drive them away. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1260.68s)]
*  We drive all their voters away. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1261.8s)]
*  My God, there's dozens of shows like that. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1263.52s)]
*  So you'll enjoy that. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1265.68s)]
*  So look, the final thing I'll say is, I became politicized in the lead up to [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1266.32s)]
*  the preemptive war in Iraq. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1271.64s)]
*  And at that time, and for a long time after that, every single Republican, [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1273.64s)]
*  we're talking about voters, members of the media and the politicians, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1279.96s)]
*  were neocons, every single one of them. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1285.0800000000002s)]
*  There wasn't an anti-war conservative to be found. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1287.72s)]
*  And it brings tears to my eyes that today that has changed. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1292.16s)]
*  That is a good thing. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1296.24s)]
*  Because we have to end this paradigm. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1297.72s)]
*  It is crushing our country. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1300.3600000000001s)]
*  And so look, if you think I'm a bad person, if you think Cenk's a bad person for [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1302.6000000000001s)]
*  being willing to work with anyone on the right who agrees with our anti-war stance. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1306.04s)]
*  Then you can go ahead and think we're bad people. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1311.24s)]
*  I really don't give a damn. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1312.96s)]
*  Yeah, I could. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1314.12s)]
*  Because I want to see results. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1314.64s)]
*  I want to see change and you're not going to get it by living and [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1316.08s)]
*  dying in an echo chamber. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1319.48s)]
*  Because of that, I'm forced to say one super last thing, guys. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1320.92s)]
*  Of course. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1323.72s)]
*  Of course. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1324.2s)]
*  So guys, I covered the Iraq war. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1325.52s)]
*  Young Turks was on the air in 2002 in the lead up to the Iraq war. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1327.64s)]
*  And so that was Ben Manquist and I back then. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1331.48s)]
*  And we were one of only two national shows against Iraq where the other one was by [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1333.6s)]
*  the legend, Amy Goodman. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1339.1599999999999s)]
*  So Democracy Now and the Young Turks going no, don't go in, don't go in. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1341.6s)]
*  And they were doing the same exact playbook as they are in Iran now, right? [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1345.6799999999998s)]
*  Now here we are, we both survived alone survivors of original digital media, right? [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1349.6399999999999s)]
*  And so and now we're both against the Iran war and [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1355.3999999999999s)]
*  tip of the hat to Amy Goodman, total legend. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1358.1599999999999s)]
*  We appreciate you sister, okay? [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1360.6s)]
*  Still going strong, buddy. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1362.36s)]
*  Yeah, and so now that is why what Ana said, [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1363.1599999999999s)]
*  if you didn't live through it, you don't know it. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1368.04s)]
*  I was tearing my hair out in the lead up to the Iraq war. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1371.56s)]
*  They didn't attack us. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1375.1599999999999s)]
*  They didn't attack us, it's a lie. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1376.8s)]
*  And the weapons of mass destruction, that's not even true. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1379.1599999999999s)]
*  And we're not going to be greeted as liberators, it's crazy, right? [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1381.6799999999998s)]
*  And at the time, there wasn't a single Republican you could find. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1386.12s)]
*  Every Republican was pro-war. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1389.9199999999998s)]
*  Correct. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1391.64s)]
*  And anytime you say, you saw your best friend Saddam Hussein, support the troops. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1392.14s)]
*  That's what everyone on the right would say. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1396.68s)]
*  And almost everyone in the middle because of so [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1399.1200000000001s)]
*  much brainwashing by mainstream media, right? [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1401.0400000000002s)]
*  Now we have allies on the right and it's unbelievable. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1403.76s)]
*  It's a great thing that they're allies. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1408.44s)]
*  And even in this preposterous fantasy land thinking that they're all lying in [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1411.96s)]
*  unison, who cares? [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1416.76s)]
*  because they're telling their viewers to be anti-war. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1419.0s)]
*  They're telling their viewers, [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1423.12s)]
*  be careful about Israel driving this agenda like they did in the Iraq war. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1424.32s)]
*  So all of those viewers and voters are getting that message. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1428.8799999999999s)]
*  And now we have allies and tons of people on our side are trying to drive [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1432.64s)]
*  those allies away. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1437.64s)]
*  Having fought with no allies at all against the Iraq war, trust me, [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1439.48s)]
*  you're in infinitely better shape with allies. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1443.68s)]
*  And then they'll say, yeah, but what good does it do? [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1447.0s)]
*  Well, without allies, without Maggie pushing back, [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1450.28s)]
*  would Donald Trump have been as clear about Israel, [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1453.24s)]
*  you're going to do the ceasefire, you're going to bring your planes back? [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1457.84s)]
*  Maybe he would have, and maybe he wouldn't have. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1461.0s)]
*  And would he have been, remember when he first said we're going to put ground [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1464.24s)]
*  troops into Gaza, Maggie pushed back ferociously, and he reversed it in 24 hours? [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1467.36s)]
*  Again, if you watch those shows, you don't know that probably. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1472.3999999999999s)]
*  Because they don't tell you when it works, right? [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1475.28s)]
*  So I do know having half of MAGA push back against this, or [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1479.04s)]
*  half of Trump's voters overall push back against this, [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1483.92s)]
*  is definitely at least a little helpful. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1488.4s)]
*  So that we get to a moderation and don't bring ground trips into Gaza or [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1491.44s)]
*  Iran and get enmeshed in a terrible war. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1495.24s)]
*  And at the very least guys, get caught trying, [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1498.0s)]
*  trying to build an alliance to stop a war. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1501.8s)]
*  Because policy is infinitely more important than which tribe you're in. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1505.08s)]
*  100%. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1509.44s)]
*  All right, we gotta take a break when we come back. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1510.4s)]
*  Some updates on the ceasefire between Israel and Iran. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1512.32s)]
*  Lot of news to get to, so stick around, we'll be right back. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1516.56s)]
*  We didn't blow up diplomacy. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1519.32s)]
*  Yes you did, yes you did. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1520.96s)]
*  All right, back on TYT here. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1523.68s)]
*  We're almost out of seats for [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1554.24s)]
*  the Brave New Films screening tomorrow night here in LA. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1555.4399999999998s)]
*  Robert Greenwald and I will do a little bit of Q&A after the movie screening. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1559.6399999999999s)]
*  I'll be at the movie screening obviously from the beginning to end. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1566.76s)]
*  So tyt.com slash events, it's free. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1570.9599999999998s)]
*  So if you're in the neighborhood, come by, there's a couple of seats left. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1573.4399999999998s)]
*  tyt.com slash events and that's Gaza Journalists under fire tomorrow night here [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1577.76s)]
*  in LA, okay, wait, no, today's Tuesday, sorry, Thursday night, [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1584.0s)]
*  Thursday night in LA, okay. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1587.44s)]
*  Yeah, okay, and so I'm going to read you guys different points of view and [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1592.68s)]
*  I'm reading it blind, except I read the first one. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1596.04s)]
*  Embedded Dude says, I live in an 80% Maggot town and [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1597.88s)]
*  I've yet to meet one who isn't 100% behind Trump, but I guess I'm in a bubble. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1600.8s)]
*  So brother, yes and no, in your neck of the woods, [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1606.08s)]
*  it might be that way or it might seem that way, right? [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1610.0s)]
*  But in other areas, it's not like that at all. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1615.04s)]
*  There's Trump voters all across the country. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1616.72s)]
*  And if in a town that is mainly Trump voters, [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1618.8799999999999s)]
*  they're more likely to be in unison, right? [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1621.36s)]
*  So that doesn't invalidate your experience. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1624.1599999999999s)]
*  Your experience is also true. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1627.44s)]
*  But two things or many, many things can be true at the same time. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1629.2s)]
*  So other people are not having that same experience that you are, right? [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1632.64s)]
*  And some are, again. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1636.48s)]
*  Robert V writes in Bernie Sanders foreign policy resonates with 90% of Maggot. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1638.5200000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know what the number is, but it's big. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1643.8000000000002s)]
*  It's big, that's why you had a lot of Bernie voters switch over and [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1645.68s)]
*  vote for Trump. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1648.3200000000002s)]
*  And the mainstream media hates that and says, yeah, that's because they love Trump. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1649.5600000000002s)]
*  No, they just were anti-war, anti-establishment. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1653.0800000000002s)]
*  Compass 1981, again, it doesn't mean that Trump is, [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1656.1200000000001s)]
*  it's just that he was at least offering up the marketing that he was. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1659.04s)]
*  Compass 1981 says, I was camping all weekend, [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1663.56s)]
*  disconnected from the world for a few days. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1665.68s)]
*  I came down from the mountain yesterday to this crap storm. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1667.08s)]
*  I seriously consider turning around and heading back to the mountains. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1671.04s)]
*  Well, we do have good news on it today, so we'll get to that in a minute. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1673.64s)]
*  Cenk's left tricep infuses, [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1677.2s)]
*  I just don't understand Kyle and Crystal attacking us. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1678.52s)]
*  They can approach change the way they want. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1681.08s)]
*  We do it our way. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1683.2s)]
*  Both can do good and move the goalposts. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1684.52s)]
*  The attacks help no one. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1686.92s)]
*  Yeah, look guys, you can watch the interview and [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1688.8s)]
*  I'm not sure that I would even frame it as Kyle and Crystal attacking us. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1691.24s)]
*  But we have a significant disagreement. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1694.64s)]
*  And that's okay as long as we don't accuse each other of like grifting or [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1697.6s)]
*  having ulterior motives. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1702.48s)]
*  Okay, we disagree and we disagree strongly. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1704.2s)]
*  So it's okay. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1706.8799999999999s)]
*  Okay, Irish Fiddles Dragon says, my understanding Candace Owens was [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1709.0s)]
*  a progressive commentator historically before making an abrupt and lucrative shift. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1711.72s)]
*  Maybe she's getting an itch on her conscience. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1716.84s)]
*  That's Candace Owens. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1720.12s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1721.9199999999998s)]
*  I think for Candace Owens, she started to be a little critical of Israel. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1723.6399999999999s)]
*  And then she got the kind of backlash that quite honestly we're used to. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1728.8s)]
*  And that made her want to dig in more. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1732.8799999999999s)]
*  And then she started learning more. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1734.8799999999999s)]
*  And then she realized, wait a minute, I've been hating Muslims all this time. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1736.4399999999998s)]
*  Because I've been told that they're the dangerous, [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1740.48s)]
*  evil terrorists who are coming for all of us. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1743.32s)]
*  Seems like a bit of a narrative was built to support [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1746.2s)]
*  what Israel wants to do in the Middle East. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1750.44s)]
*  And so I actually think it came organically. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1752.16s)]
*  And this is what happens, by the way, when someone faces the kind of backlash [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1755.4s)]
*  she faced makes people more curious about what's really going on. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1759.64s)]
*  All right, so there's like a million comments and [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1776.2s)]
*  I'll keep reading them throughout the show. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1779.1200000000001s)]
*  I'll just read one here and then we'll get to the news. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1781.44s)]
*  David Rodriguez wrote, I've lived in a hard right area all my life. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1784.96s)]
*  I've never once shifted right. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1789.96s)]
*  I've talked to so many right leaning people along the years about politics. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1791.8400000000001s)]
*  And they're not psychos, they're human beings. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1795.44s)]
*  Yes. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1797.64s)]
*  Okay, I mean, it's not like I'm a psycho. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1798.16s)]
*  I'm a psycho. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1800.0800000000002s)]
*  I'm a psycho. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1801.0800000000002s)]
*  I'm a psycho. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1802.0800000000002s)]
*  I'm a psycho. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1803.0800000000002s)]
*  Human beings. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1804.12s)]
*  Yes. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1804.8799999999999s)]
*  Okay, I mean, it's such a simple thing. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1805.6s)]
*  But these days if you say like MAGA is our human, [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1807.4399999999998s)]
*  that literally triggers some people, right? [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1811.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah, if you say you believe in people power, then prove it. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1813.76s)]
*  That's it. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1817.32s)]
*  That's interesting too. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1818.24s)]
*  Doesn't mean you have to agree with them on most of the things. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1819.28s)]
*  I just want to keep saying that, [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1822.28s)]
*  because people want to live in a black and white world. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1824.3999999999999s)]
*  Okay, let's keep going. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1826.0s)]
*  All right, let's get to the news. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1826.9199999999998s)]
*  This was a surprising thing to wake up to, but nonetheless, take a look. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1828.84s)]
*  We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1833.32s)]
*  hard that they don't know what the f*** they're doing. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1837.52s)]
*  Do you understand that? [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1840.8s)]
*  I do, I do understand that. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1843.3999999999999s)]
*  That was President Donald Trump. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1845.12s)]
*  And as of this morning, it seemed as though the ceasefire deal between Iran and [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1846.76s)]
*  Israel was basically off. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1852.0s)]
*  And that was what Trump was responding to. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1854.48s)]
*  He was frustrated by it. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1856.3999999999999s)]
*  But what was even more surprising was the tough talk that he had for Israel. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1858.36s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1864.84s)]
*  Israel, as soon as we made the deal, they came out and [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1866.84s)]
*  they dropped a load of bombs, the likes of which I've never seen before. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1869.48s)]
*  The biggest load that we've seen. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1873.16s)]
*  I'm not happy with Israel. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1875.0s)]
*  When I say, okay, now you have 12 hours, [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1876.84s)]
*  you don't go out in the first hour and just drop everything you have on them. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1879.88s)]
*  So I'm not happy with them. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1883.24s)]
*  I'm not happy with Iran either. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1885.0s)]
*  But I'm really unhappy if Israel's going out this morning because the one rocket [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1886.8s)]
*  that didn't land that was shot, perhaps by mistake, that didn't land. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1891.28s)]
*  I'm not happy about that. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1895.6s)]
*  So he's referring to Iran allegedly shooting a rocket or [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1898.12s)]
*  a missile that may have been shot accidentally. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1902.52s)]
*  It didn't hurt anyone, it didn't damage anything. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1906.0s)]
*  And then in response to that, Israel basically does what Israel usually does, [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1908.6399999999999s)]
*  overreact, over respond and use disproportionate force. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1914.28s)]
*  Now, that's the reason why he had harsher words for Israel. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1919.84s)]
*  And to be honest with you, I don't think I've ever heard an American president [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1922.8s)]
*  be so critical of Israel openly, overtly. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1928.16s)]
*  You'll read about what they have to say about Israel behind the scenes, maybe. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1931.32s)]
*  But in this case, wow. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1935.88s)]
*  Now, let me just quickly say, Cenk, before I go to you. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1937.72s)]
*  The ceasefire is back on. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1940.64s)]
*  I still think it's a little bit fragile considering the fact that we all know that [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1943.36s)]
*  Israel wants a regime change war. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1947.6799999999998s)]
*  That's what they want. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1949.6799999999998s)]
*  Now, their statements later in the day made me think maybe this will hold. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1951.08s)]
*  I don't want to get too hopeful because every time I get too hopeful, [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1956.6799999999998s)]
*  things fall apart. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1959.1999999999998s)]
*  But Cenk, I'm curious what you think. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1960.12s)]
*  No, I'm going to go way further. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1961.84s)]
*  I loved it. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1962.9599999999998s)]
*  It's the first time I've ever seen an American president do that in my lifetime. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1964.1999999999998s)]
*  And so, okay, now the usual caveats and then I'll get back to why I loved it. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1967.52s)]
*  That doesn't mean I love Trump. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1973.44s)]
*  That doesn't mean I agree with everything Trump does. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1974.8799999999999s)]
*  That doesn't mean that I agreed with Trump when he dropped bombs on Iran. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1977.04s)]
*  It doesn't mean that I have a mind meld with everything Trump does just because I agree [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1980.44s)]
*  with one thing he did. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1986.56s)]
*  Okay, now back to our regular programming. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1987.8s)]
*  Okay, so did you ever see Biden going, both these countries, Israel and Iran, are effing [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1990.12s)]
*  around, right? [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1997.12s)]
*  No, he would never say that about Israel. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=1998.68s)]
*  And so him yelling at Israel, this is just unprecedented. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2001.2s)]
*  I mean, show me an American president who yelled at Israel in my lifetime. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2005.32s)]
*  NBC News reported today that the Israelis were stunned, stunned by- [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2009.72s)]
*  Yes, yes, okay. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2014.1200000000001s)]
*  And so, look guys, it's not just standard caveats. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2017.4s)]
*  It's true. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2020.96s)]
*  He started the war in the first place. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2021.96s)]
*  He shouldn't have done that, right? [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2022.96s)]
*  He shouldn't have dropped the bombs. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2023.96s)]
*  And I was furious with him. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2024.96s)]
*  I mean, we were on tape. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2025.96s)]
*  You saw it when it happened. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2027.52s)]
*  When he does terrible things, you massively criticize him, right? [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2029.2s)]
*  Now when he's doing the right thing and going, okay, well, now we're gonna do a ceasefire. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2033.54s)]
*  And Israel, this ceasefire also applies to you. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2037.78s)]
*  Then you go, okay, attaboy, finally an American president, right? [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2042.52s)]
*  Because every time there's a ceasefire, if you don't know this, Israel breaks it. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2046.14s)]
*  Is it every single time? [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2052.0s)]
*  No. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2053.48s)]
*  Is it almost every time? [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2054.48s)]
*  Yes, okay? [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2055.48s)]
*  So what Israel did this time was the same as they've always done. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2056.62s)]
*  They're like, ceasefire, great. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2059.66s)]
*  We'll get to keep bombing him. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2061.2s)]
*  They dropped 100 bombs on Tehran after the ceasefire. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2062.3399999999997s)]
*  That's why Trump was furious. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2067.06s)]
*  Right. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2068.42s)]
*  He said, he's like, I said ceasefire. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2069.42s)]
*  So I mean, we're gonna give you the details. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2071.7s)]
*  He called Netanyahu, etc., right? [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2073.42s)]
*  But for an American president to say no, Israel was wrong. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2076.14s)]
*  Because the framing of the question, the media as always was like, are you gonna yell at [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2080.56s)]
*  Iran for breaking the ceasefire? [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2084.96s)]
*  And that's when Trump said, no, they both broke it. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2087.12s)]
*  And I'm more mad at Israel. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2090.48s)]
*  And I've never seen it. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2092.4s)]
*  I've never seen it either. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2093.68s)]
*  Yeah, so- [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2094.68s)]
*  Right? [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2095.68s)]
*  Normally what an American president would do is, yes, Iran broke the ceasefire. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2096.68s)]
*  They'd lie on behalf of Israel. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2099.16s)]
*  They say, yes, Iran broke the ceasefire. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2101.12s)]
*  We hate Iran. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2102.76s)]
*  We're thinking of going back and bombing them again. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2103.76s)]
*  And of course, Israel's right about everything. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2106.32s)]
*  The very fact that an American president is saying that Israel is wrong is unprecedented. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2108.52s)]
*  And it's an enormous relief. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2115.0s)]
*  He could turn around any minute now. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2117.06s)]
*  But for now, I'll take it. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2119.3199999999997s)]
*  Okay, so luckily, the ceasefire appears to be holding for now, okay? [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2121.56s)]
*  So as of this morning, the Wall Street Journal reported that Israel confirmed the ceasefire, [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2126.7999999999997s)]
*  saying that it had achieved its war aims, having removed a dual existential threat from [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2131.6s)]
*  Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile programs. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2138.3999999999996s)]
*  So they want to claim victory. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2142.32s)]
*  And if that's what we need to allow them to do, just so they step back and stop warring [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2144.2000000000003s)]
*  with Iran, great. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2148.8s)]
*  Yes, you guys won. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2149.8s)]
*  You guys did everything you wanted to do. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2150.96s)]
*  Iran's foreign minister had said that his country would stop its attacks as long as [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2153.6400000000003s)]
*  Israel stopped theirs. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2158.0s)]
*  In addition to that, and much to the chagrin of neoconservatives like Mark Levin, Trump [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2160.54s)]
*  made clear that the US was not seeking regime change in Iran. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2168.04s)]
*  Now remember, over the weekend, he flirted with the idea of regime change in Iran. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2173.44s)]
*  But I think something happened between then and now. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2178.7200000000003s)]
*  Likely a contingent of his supporters were like, we didn't vote for this. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2182.88s)]
*  You said that you weren't gonna start new wars. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2187.04s)]
*  This is a new war. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2188.7400000000002s)]
*  So he might have backed off for that reason. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2189.82s)]
*  But we don't know for sure, obviously. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2191.84s)]
*  Israel has lifted nearly all wartime restrictions on civilian movement and economic activity [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2193.84s)]
*  in Israel. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2199.1600000000003s)]
*  And the Israeli airport authority said Ben Gurion and Haifa airports are returning to [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2200.88s)]
*  full activity. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2206.32s)]
*  They wouldn't do that if they intended to start bombing Iran again. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2207.32s)]
*  But what should be concerning is what the Wall Street Journal also reported about how [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2212.86s)]
*  Israel is now gonna shift its attention back to Gaza. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2217.6800000000003s)]
*  Now, let me be clear. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2220.1600000000003s)]
*  The slaughter has continued in Gaza. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2221.48s)]
*  That hasn't stopped. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2223.2s)]
*  Every single day, there's new reports about dozens of civilians getting shelled at, shot, [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2224.7999999999997s)]
*  killed by IDF soldiers. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2229.96s)]
*  And you also have the chief of staff for the IDF saying, we have concluded a significant [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2232.68s)]
*  phase. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2238.4399999999996s)]
*  Now the focus shifts back to Gaza to bring the hostages home and to dismantle the Hamas [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2239.4399999999996s)]
*  regime. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2245.3199999999997s)]
*  So I'm worried about things getting even more brutal for Palestinians in Gaza. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2246.3199999999997s)]
*  We can talk about that in just a minute. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2251.22s)]
*  But Cenk, I was unfortunately juggling my mom in the hospital and the news today. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2252.8199999999997s)]
*  But tell me about the conversation that Trump had with Bibi Netanyahu. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2259.4199999999996s)]
*  Yeah, the sources from both mainstream media and MAGA media saying that he ripped Netanyahu [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2264.22s)]
*  a new a-hole. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2271.7s)]
*  Yes. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2272.7s)]
*  Okay, and not like when Biden would fake, I am so mad at you. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2273.7s)]
*  How big do you want the check to be? [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2278.8999999999996s)]
*  Right? [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2280.7s)]
*  Now to be fair to Biden, he did not want to attack Iran, right? [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2281.7s)]
*  So fair is fair on all of that. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2284.54s)]
*  So now, in terms of what's the next part of this is, I'm really worried about it. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2286.38s)]
*  So the good news is that it appears Israel actually does want to stop the war with Iran. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2293.1s)]
*  Which I'm super afraid to say, because again, they could change any second now and they [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2299.8599999999997s)]
*  usually love war. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2304.94s)]
*  And they leaked intel today, not Israel. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2306.3399999999997s)]
*  They leaked it from our intelligence, but half the time that's usually fake Israeli [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2309.74s)]
*  intelligence. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2313.66s)]
*  Either way, I don't know if it's real or fake, but they say, I don't think we got all the [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2314.66s)]
*  uranium. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2317.7799999999997s)]
*  I think we, I'm not saying we gotta go back, but CNN is reporting that and the pundits [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2318.7799999999997s)]
*  are all going, we gotta go back, we didn't get all the uranium. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2324.58s)]
*  God, they're the worst. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2327.14s)]
*  Right, so it's possible that Israel doesn't really want peace and they might wanna keep- [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2328.14s)]
*  No, no, it's not Cenk. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2331.7799999999997s)]
*  No, no, no, no, let me finish. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2332.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I hear you. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2334.02s)]
*  No, there's two potential objectives that they have, right? [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2335.2999999999997s)]
*  Well, they've stated those two objectives, so they're not potential. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2339.7s)]
*  So the question is, are they gonna try to pursue both or only one of them, right? [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2342.54s)]
*  And why would they only pursue one of them? [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2346.54s)]
*  One of their objectives was not the nuclear stuff. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2348.3399999999997s)]
*  They don't have a nuke, they knew that they weren't gonna have a nuke. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2350.62s)]
*  It was for regime change. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2353.3799999999997s)]
*  So they didn't get regime change in Iran. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2354.74s)]
*  They did destroy those facilities and they struck back, but are they satisfied with that [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2356.8199999999997s)]
*  or are they gonna get greedy and push and push? [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2363.3799999999997s)]
*  But the second objective, don't lose track of this, is a bigger objective for Israel, [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2365.66s)]
*  which is, hey, I just destroyed Hamas, the whole idea of dismantling, literally all Hamas [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2369.7799999999997s)]
*  leaders are dead. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2374.5s)]
*  Okay, they destroyed Hezbollah, literally all of Hezbollah's leaders are dead. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2375.5s)]
*  So they have new leaders because that's what happens when you kill their leaders, right? [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2378.8999999999996s)]
*  But they decimated them as much as they could possibly decimate them. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2382.3799999999997s)]
*  They cleared out Western Syria, they cleared out Southern Lebanon, and now they've cleared [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2385.8399999999997s)]
*  out any offensive capabilities of Iran. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2389.3399999999997s)]
*  So now, militarily, there's no one to defend the Palestinians. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2392.2599999999998s)]
*  Yes, thank you. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2395.38s)]
*  Okay. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2396.6600000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2397.6600000000003s)]
*  So now you could say, hey, they shouldn't have defended them that way, and it's terrorism, [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2398.6600000000003s)]
*  and it's awful, etc. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2400.98s)]
*  Okay, no problem, okay? [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2401.98s)]
*  But that is what was happening. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2403.94s)]
*  And so now without that, Israel thinks free reign, total ethnic cleansing, drive them [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2405.58s)]
*  into the desert. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2412.1s)]
*  And this is, again, not speculation, it's not anti-Semitic, their cabinet voted on it. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2413.82s)]
*  And if it's anti-Semitic, then their cabinet is anti-Semitic. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2418.26s)]
*  Because they voted on it that they're going to conquer Gaza and take all of it for Israel [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2420.66s)]
*  to set up greater Israel, right? [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2425.54s)]
*  Yes, yep. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2427.3799999999997s)]
*  So now they think, okay, now we've decimated any defense they might have had, and Trump [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2428.3799999999997s)]
*  will let us do whatever we want as long as we're not bothering him. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2433.7s)]
*  So now we get to finish the genocide, okay? [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2437.7799999999997s)]
*  And so that is probably their number one motive and why they don't mind backing off from Iran [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2440.94s)]
*  at this point. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2445.96s)]
*  But like I said, they might get greedy and go, nah, now we want both. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2448.18s)]
*  We want regime change and to ethnically cleanse Gaza, so they might agitate for more war. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2453.22s)]
*  So we don't know that yet, and we'll see how the developments are going. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2459.22s)]
*  But you could tell that Netanyahu was relatively okay with the ceasefire. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2462.04s)]
*  And by the way, also because he wasn't gonna listen to it. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2467.14s)]
*  He thought that ceasefire means they stop attacking, and the American president lies [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2470.1s)]
*  for me and I get to keep attacking, right? [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2474.2999999999997s)]
*  So he didn't expect that Trump would say, no, you stop too. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2476.74s)]
*  He was genuinely shocked by that. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2479.8199999999997s)]
*  So okay, but it seems like he might not mind banging away. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2481.9199999999996s)]
*  How do I know that? [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2485.8199999999997s)]
*  Cuz Mark Levin, who basically is, I mean, he's Israel first, obviously. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2486.8199999999997s)]
*  He's a neocon, he's a war hawk, etc. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2490.3799999999997s)]
*  So he was like, this is terrible, I hate the world, Jesus, right? [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2493.18s)]
*  And then afterwards he put out a tweet going, I so hate it, but Netanyahu says it's okay. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2497.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, that's right, shut up, bitch. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2503.74s)]
*  So since he's a little puppy dog bitch for Netanyahu, when he goes, that's okay, that [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2505.7s)]
*  means Netanyahu's told him, hey, go tell sucker Americans that it's okay. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2510.8199999999997s)]
*  I'm now delivering a message through you, but you're American. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2515.9399999999996s)]
*  Go get them, Mark, they still think you're an American, that's hilarious, go ahead. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2519.22s)]
*  Now back to Trump's motivations and what might have persuaded him. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2524.1s)]
*  Polling indicated that Americans felt a certain way about going to war with Iran, bombing [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2529.8999999999996s)]
*  Iran. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2535.18s)]
*  Let's take a look at what our good friend Harry Enton had to say about it. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2536.18s)]
*  Things are moving quite quickly, but these are initial readings. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2540.8599999999997s)]
*  And I will say from a historical perspective, I am surprised that the net approval rating [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2543.02s)]
*  is so low on these strikes. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2546.8999999999996s)]
*  And it's in two different polls, it's our CNN SSRS poll, 12 points underwater, one thumbs [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2548.3399999999997s)]
*  down. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2552.62s)]
*  How about the Reuters-Ipsos poll? [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2553.62s)]
*  Look at that, the exact same reading, minus nine points underwater, two thumbs down. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2554.7799999999997s)]
*  Normally, these airstrikes rate quite highly, but this one, you go back through history, [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2559.1s)]
*  rates as the lowest that I could possibly find on the historical record. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2563.94s)]
*  How about Republican opinion on this? [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2567.94s)]
*  Yeah, I think there's this idea, okay, maybe the MAGA base wouldn't necessarily like this. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2569.5s)]
*  Look, this is Donald Trump's Republican Party. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2574.34s)]
*  That's why I think it's so important to note GOP on the US airstrikes in Iran, 76% in the [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2577.7400000000002s)]
*  average of the two polls approved, compared to just 18% who disapprove. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2582.06s)]
*  Now I will note that is a bit higher than Donald Trump's disapproval rating within the [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2585.62s)]
*  Republican Party. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2588.94s)]
*  But overall, Republicans are with Donald Trump on this. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2590.06s)]
*  Tucker Carlson be darned. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2593.42s)]
*  Tucker Carlson be darned. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2596.5s)]
*  Now I wish that same poll got into the idea of a protracted or prolonged war with Iran [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2597.98s)]
*  over their alleged nuclear program, which it was never really about their nuclear program. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2605.26s)]
*  How do Republican voters feel about a regime change war? [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2609.54s)]
*  I still believe that the majority of Republican voters probably would back a regime change [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2612.2200000000003s)]
*  war in Iran. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2616.62s)]
*  But I think the percentage who would not back it would increase significantly if we're talking [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2617.62s)]
*  about a long forever war in an effort to change the regime in Iran. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2622.78s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, no, no, this is one I've given to Harry Antin a lot of credit before, but [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2627.6200000000003s)]
*  this is one where he's massively biased. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2632.7000000000003s)]
*  I don't know if it's him or CNN, but it's comical. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2635.5400000000004s)]
*  So first off, he's like, I don't know why it's so low. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2638.9s)]
*  I mean, what the hell? [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2641.46s)]
*  Of course we should bomb Iran. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2642.82s)]
*  Harry, you're saying it out loud. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2644.2200000000003s)]
*  We can hear you when you say, I don't know why it's so low. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2646.94s)]
*  I need it to be higher. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2649.94s)]
*  Attack, CNN's telling me in my ear attack, okay? [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2651.94s)]
*  But that's not even the big tell. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2655.62s)]
*  The big tell was in the second poll. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2657.44s)]
*  They said in a combined average of CNN and Rogers, and I was checking the bottom as he [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2660.14s)]
*  was saying that to see what the source was. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2665.02s)]
*  Because I know in the CNN poll, more Republicans disagree with Trump. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2667.38s)]
*  They did an average to lessen the effect of their own poll. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2672.5s)]
*  To be fair, every time we use a Harry Antin clip, he does do averages, to be fair. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2677.18s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2683.58s)]
*  Doesn't he? [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2684.58s)]
*  No, he sometimes does a poll and he did on this issue too. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2685.58s)]
*  And then he'll say, and most of the polls are like this. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2689.46s)]
*  Sometimes he'll use averages. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2692.54s)]
*  A lot of times he'll use a single poll. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2693.54s)]
*  I haven't seen him combine just two polls like that. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2695.58s)]
*  To be fair, they were on the same issue. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2698.46s)]
*  Right. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2699.8199999999997s)]
*  I can see why he would combine them. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2700.8199999999997s)]
*  But I noticed that the CNN poll came out more MAGA disagreeing with Trump. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2702.18s)]
*  And I remember thinking because we covered this once before, I wonder if they'll report [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2709.68s)]
*  that. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2714.8199999999997s)]
*  And what do they do? [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2715.8199999999997s)]
*  They didn't report it by itself. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2716.8199999999997s)]
*  They put it together with the Reuters poll to drive up the number. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2718.18s)]
*  Because what they're basically saying is, now Donald Trump, if you want to make your [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2720.98s)]
*  base happy, still attack Iran. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2724.0s)]
*  I mean, attacking Iran is a really, really good idea. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2725.3799999999997s)]
*  I don't know why these overall numbers are low. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2727.8199999999997s)]
*  But remember, among your base, not bad, not bad. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2729.74s)]
*  Keep going, keep going. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2731.92s)]
*  Come on, man, come on. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2732.92s)]
*  You're being super obvious. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2734.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2736.16s)]
*  And this is, of course, the same CNN that we showed you yesterday. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2737.16s)]
*  Immediately brought on a general to say, Trump was brilliant and decisive, and these strikes [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2740.08s)]
*  are great. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2746.92s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2747.92s)]
*  And I saw another clip just earlier today where they had this hilarious thing. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2749.52s)]
*  They're like Marjorie Taylor Greene, it's in one of our stories today. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2754.16s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor Greene seems to be splitting and saying that the real MAGA is against the [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2758.52s)]
*  war and she's attacking neocons. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2762.6s)]
*  And then CNN goes to a neocon pundit. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2764.7200000000003s)]
*  And the pundit goes, there are no neocons. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2767.92s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2770.8s)]
*  And MAGA does whatever Trump wants and Trump is for the war. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2772.64s)]
*  Okay, okay. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2776.0s)]
*  So- So why don't we do this? [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2777.0s)]
*  Why don't we take a break, come back, and we're gonna show you that clip. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2779.76s)]
*  You're gonna see exactly how it went down. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2783.2400000000002s)]
*  It is an incredible story. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2785.2000000000003s)]
*  There is that split in the Republican Party, the anti-war versus the pro-war. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2787.16s)]
*  And we're gonna provide the proof. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2793.56s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2796.72s)]
*  They dropped the load, the biggest load that we've seen. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2797.72s)]
*  All right, back on TYT. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2827.72s)]
*  So a ton of comments to get through, a lot of them are great and some of them are challenging [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2830.52s)]
*  and I wanna do those even more. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2833.7599999999998s)]
*  First, Christina Lisa Brown said, love peace blessings to Anna and her fam. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2835.16s)]
*  Thank you for saying that, Christina. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2838.64s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2839.64s)]
*  This is on Super Chat. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2840.64s)]
*  Brighousemama98 said, I watch Kyle and Crystal and TYT. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2841.64s)]
*  It just seems like Cenk is more combative with leftist than the right. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2844.3999999999996s)]
*  I agree more with Cenk overall, but why not afford the same tone to our friends than we [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2847.52s)]
*  do with Republicans? [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2851.4399999999996s)]
*  Can I explain it real quick? [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2852.8799999999997s)]
*  I know I'm a nerd. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2854.56s)]
*  I think it's because we get attacked by the left a lot. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2855.96s)]
*  And it's not just like, we disagree with you. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2860.2400000000002s)]
*  It's your character is wanting. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2863.76s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2867.2000000000003s)]
*  So you respond to the people who attack you and the left attacks us the most. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2868.6800000000003s)]
*  No, no, that's true, but it's beyond that. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2874.48s)]
*  Cuz the right attacks us on a whole bunch of things too. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2878.08s)]
*  You read my ex comments, my God, the right attacks me in a thousand ways, right? [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2880.52s)]
*  But they attack us on things we actually believe, whereas the left attacks us on things they [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2885.16s)]
*  think we believe. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2889.8799999999997s)]
*  They're making up. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2891.6s)]
*  Yeah, I got you. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2892.6s)]
*  But specifically, when I'm in the interviews, and you can see this with your own eyes, you [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2893.6s)]
*  go back and watch old ones or the new ones that come up, right? [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2897.7599999999998s)]
*  I never lose my cool unless the other person is attacking me and not letting me respond. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2901.7599999999998s)]
*  So it's not about left or right for me when I'm in the middle of an interview, okay? [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2909.04s)]
*  So Lex Friedman never interrupts, gives me an opportunity to answer then ask the next [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2912.96s)]
*  question. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2919.12s)]
*  Agree or disagree, I don't even know what Lex's positions are, but we have a civil conversation. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2920.12s)]
*  Every time somebody has a civil conversation, I'm civil back. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2923.96s)]
*  I'm not gonna randomly yell from no reason out of nowhere. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2926.64s)]
*  And the number one place you see this is not with Colin Crystal, it's on Piers Morgan. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2930.64s)]
*  When an Israeli, the minute I start talking, they start talking over me so that I can't [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2935.32s)]
*  get my points out. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2939.68s)]
*  And I'm like, okay, if you're gonna talk over me, then I'm gonna talk over you. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2940.68s)]
*  And trust me, I'm gonna be louder than you, okay? [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2943.0s)]
*  So that's why. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2946.2799999999997s)]
*  And Kyle and Crystal, I don't think that they were trying to do it. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2947.3999999999996s)]
*  I don't think they were trying to agitate me. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2950.44s)]
*  But they constantly talked over me, interrupted me, and yelled at me, so that I couldn't get [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2952.24s)]
*  my point out unless I raised my voice. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2957.0s)]
*  So I'm just giving back what I'm receiving, that's why. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2959.16s)]
*  I'm not because I'm particularly hostile to them. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2962.04s)]
*  I just match the tone of the interviewer or the debater, that's all. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2964.6s)]
*  Joe Heiko writes in, Cenk, they're guilty of what you used to be guilty of. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2969.76s)]
*  We think you're racist because you voted for Trump, that's a quote from me. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2973.0s)]
*  Joe, see, that's a legitimate criticism. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2975.84s)]
*  I did say that, right? [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2977.6400000000003s)]
*  And I think that is the wrong approach. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2979.8s)]
*  And by the way, it's okay to learn from things. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2982.5600000000004s)]
*  And by the way, part of my book, I attack Republican voters. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2984.6800000000003s)]
*  And it's true, it's factual. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2989.8s)]
*  If you read the chapter two of my book, chapter three, I'm sorry, it's literally called Why [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2991.32s)]
*  Republicans Suck, okay? [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2996.7599999999998s)]
*  And justice is coming. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=2998.7599999999998s)]
*  But especially after you lose the popular vote, what it'll do is drive voters away. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3001.24s)]
*  So even if correct, it's the wrong strategy at this time. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3007.56s)]
*  But overall, I realized, no, it's not even correct. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3012.18s)]
*  Yes, some of their voters are that way. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3014.9599999999996s)]
*  But generally speaking about all voters in that way is not accurate and is definitely [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3017.5s)]
*  not helpful. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3021.8399999999997s)]
*  So I was wrong to say that earlier on strategy grounds alone, let alone everything else. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3022.88s)]
*  Okay, Colin Gribbin said, it's funny how Trump after getting back in office is discovering [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3028.8s)]
*  things that literally everyone else in America knew that Israel is partially responsible [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3032.44s)]
*  for provoking conflicts and that Putin has no interest in peace. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3036.1600000000003s)]
*  Now, that is a very accurate statement. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3039.44s)]
*  All right, back on TYT, Cenk, Ana and Sarah Ganab. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3052.88s)]

*  We appreciate you guys, Ana. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3081.84s)]
*  Let's get to our next story. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3083.36s)]
*  Marjorie Teller-Green has to be one of the dumbest people to ever serve in the House [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3085.6400000000003s)]
*  of Representatives. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3090.28s)]
*  The stupidity that comes out of that woman's mouth is hard to imagine. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3091.28s)]
*  I can't believe that Fox News allows one of their hosts to go around and call me names [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3095.4s)]
*  on his social media. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3101.2000000000003s)]
*  That is so unprofessional and it really speaks to what kind of media company Fox News is. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3102.76s)]
*  His screeching is absolutely unbearable. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3109.44s)]
*  But I think Fox News needs to reel him in. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3112.64s)]
*  I think his screeching is hilarious and I sometimes watch for comedic effect, honestly. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3117.16s)]
*  But who you just heard from is Representative Marjorie Taylor-Green, a Republican Congresswoman. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3122.52s)]
*  Speaking about Mark Levin, a neocon who has never met a war, especially in the Middle [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3128.16s)]
*  East that he didn't love. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3133.7599999999998s)]
*  And has been pushing for a regime change war in Iran on behalf of Israel. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3135.6s)]
*  Now this right wing feuding continues, this time between Warhawk Mark Levin and Magadharling [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3140.16s)]
*  Marjorie Green. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3147.2799999999997s)]
*  And their battle is reaching a fever pitch, this week especially, as you have Mark Levin [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3148.3999999999996s)]
*  agitating for this ongoing war in Iran and Green calling for peace. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3156.6s)]
*  So on Matt Gaetz's show, Green pressed Fox News to basically reel in Levin after he called [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3161.64s)]
*  her a shameless nitwit for opposing bombing Iran's nuclear sites. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3171.68s)]
*  And as we'll get into shortly, Levin also would love for the war to expand beyond just [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3178.16s)]
*  bombing nuclear facilities. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3183.72s)]
*  Levin also argued that the MTG Gaetz Carlson side of the party was more representative [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3185.84s)]
*  of MAGA as a whole, so take a look. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3192.6000000000004s)]
*  Reaction to Mark Levin saying we aren't real MAGA because we don't want a regime change [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3197.6000000000004s)]
*  war in Iran. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3201.88s)]
*  He was a never Trumper from the beginning. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3202.88s)]
*  He hated Donald Trump. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3205.1200000000003s)]
*  He was totally against him and tried to stop him from becoming president. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3206.8s)]
*  But yet now somehow Mark Levin is the voice of MAGA. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3210.76s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3214.52s)]
*  Matt, you and I, Tucker Carlson, Steve Bannon, all of us that have been fighting hard to [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3215.52s)]
*  stay on these America first policies and stay out of foreign wars, we're MAGA. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3221.24s)]
*  We're the voice of MAGA and the people totally agree with us. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3226.68s)]
*  So it doesn't matter what Mark Levin actually has to say. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3230.96s)]
*  People don't watch his show. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3235.44s)]
*  I don't know anyone that watches his show. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3236.72s)]
*  Again, some people do watch to laugh at him. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3241.0s)]
*  But Levin did not take kindly to what Marjorie Taylor Greene had to say there. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3243.16s)]
*  He writes on X, MTG, God, you were stupid. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3246.88s)]
*  And you keep banging your head against the wall. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3249.96s)]
*  Thankfully, the President of the United States ignored you and hit the Iranian nuclear sites. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3252.92s)]
*  You seem very upset about it. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3257.96s)]
*  I'm not going away. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3259.64s)]
*  You're on my radar. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3261.2s)]
*  To which Greene responded, this is extremely sick and disturbing. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3262.7599999999998s)]
*  Please read to the end. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3267.24s)]
*  You have the exact same tone and language that the psychopaths use that send me death [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3270.0s)]
*  threats every single day. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3275.72s)]
*  You should be fired from Fox News and shame on Fox if they condone this. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3277.72s)]
*  I am for peace. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3281.72s)]
*  I oppose war, including wars, Israel wages. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3282.8799999999997s)]
*  Should I feel that my life is in danger now too? [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3286.8399999999997s)]
*  What about President Trump, who strongly rebuked Israel this morning for continuing to attack [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3290.0s)]
*  Iran? [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3295.48s)]
*  And Marjorie Taylor Greene is right about one thing. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3297.12s)]
*  Levin isn't about peace. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3299.28s)]
*  And Tucker Carlson, by the way, exposed something pretty interesting about him on his podcast [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3301.6800000000003s)]
*  recently. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3306.5600000000004s)]
*  Let's take a quick look at that and then we'll go to Cenk. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3307.5600000000004s)]
*  Nobody's dragging us into anything. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3310.7200000000003s)]
*  It's not the Jews. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3312.32s)]
*  It's not Israel again. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3313.44s)]
*  No. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3315.6400000000003s)]
*  Long range, intercontinental ballistic missiles with nuclear warheads are for you and me and [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3316.6400000000003s)]
*  your children and your grandchildren. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3326.1200000000003s)]
*  That's what's airing on Fox. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3328.28s)]
*  By the way, that same person, Mark Levin, who was a totally minor player in Fox World [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3330.0800000000004s)]
*  up until recently, I can tell you firsthand, suggested today that we send nuclear weapons [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3335.7200000000003s)]
*  to Ukraine too. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3342.1600000000003s)]
*  But I should just make it clear. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3343.1600000000003s)]
*  In the last clip that we played, he said, intercontinental ballistic missiles armed [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3346.7200000000003s)]
*  with nuclear warheads are meant for you. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3351.1000000000004s)]
*  They're going to kill you, the mullahs. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3353.2000000000003s)]
*  They aren't going to send us and have intercontinental ballistic missiles. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3356.52s)]
*  It doesn't have nuclear warheads. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3359.2s)]
*  All of this is, it's deranged. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3360.94s)]
*  Yeah, pretty deranged. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3364.52s)]
*  You know what else is deranged? [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3367.7s)]
*  Pretending that they are not disagreeing. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3369.22s)]
*  A lot of people on the left say there's no disagreement. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3372.34s)]
*  No, disagreement's real. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3374.8s)]
*  It is. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3376.56s)]
*  I mean, it's obviously real. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3377.56s)]
*  It's the most, Piers Morton just did a whole episode on the split in the Maggott Coalition. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3378.56s)]
*  But if you listen to other shows, they'll tell you don't believe your lying eyes. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3384.34s)]
*  I don't know, well, some of them, not all of them also told you that Joe Biden was young. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3389.02s)]
*  Okay, so yeah, no, there's clearly a huge split here. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3392.98s)]
*  And this split's not difficult to ascertain, right? [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3397.1000000000004s)]
*  What's going on here? [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3400.1800000000003s)]
*  The Israel first crowd always wants us to do whatever Israel wants, right? [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3401.7000000000003s)]
*  And Mark Levin is a despicable person on 100 different levels, including when he says, [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3405.98s)]
*  it's against Israel, it's against the Jews. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3411.1400000000003s)]
*  No, no, don't conflate the two, you're gonna drive up anti-Semitism, you smug. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3413.9399999999996s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3417.58s)]
*  Right? [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3418.1s)]
*  No, nobody's saying anything against the Jews. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3418.7799999999997s)]
*  And as I've said a billion times, some of the best fighters for [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3420.8599999999997s)]
*  peace in America are Jewish Americans. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3424.54s)]
*  So this has nothing to do with the Jews. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3426.58s)]
*  But when you bring it in, you're ironically doing the anti-Semitic trope of all Jews have [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3427.74s)]
*  dual loyalty to Israel. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3432.74s)]
*  No, brother, that's you, not other Jews, okay? [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3434.14s)]
*  You're doing projection, because you would love to serve Israel. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3437.2599999999998s)]
*  So why don't you move to Israel and sit in Tel Aviv and tell us all these wonderful things. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3441.06s)]
*  But leave my Jewish friends and family out of this, okay? [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3445.7s)]
*  You got no right to talk about them like that. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3448.46s)]
*  Okay, so now we go to Tucker and I was writing it down as he said it. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3450.46s)]
*  Wait, Iran doesn't have intercontinental ballistic missiles or nukes or warheads. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3457.18s)]
*  So we're all about to get murdered by weapons they don't have. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3462.9s)]
*  Why? [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3467.3s)]
*  Because this is, and now this is again, it's literal, [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3468.1s)]
*  it's not some sort of trope or anything. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3470.2599999999998s)]
*  Israel's leaders and predominantly Benjamin Netanyahu for [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3472.14s)]
*  the last 33 years is on tape saying they're going to kill us all. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3475.54s)]
*  They're going to, Iran is going to nuke America. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3479.18s)]
*  America's in danger. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3481.86s)]
*  Any minute now, any minute now, any minute now for 33 straight years. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3483.8199999999997s)]
*  So obviously Israel wanted us to attack Iran and [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3487.5s)]
*  Mark Levin wants us to do whatever Israel wants. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3491.3399999999997s)]
*  And Tucker Carlson, Marjorie Taylor Greene are saying something that's logical if [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3494.94s)]
*  you're a right winger. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3498.1800000000003s)]
*  When your movement is called America First, they're saying, wait, [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3499.5s)]
*  why don't we take care of America First and have a conversation about, wait, [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3504.9s)]
*  does this help us or not help us? [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3508.94s)]
*  How does it help us? [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3510.9s)]
*  Let's just talk it through. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3512.3s)]
*  And that's when Mark Levin and all the Israel First guys jumping in. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3513.94s)]
*  I don't know what I just heard. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3516.7400000000002s)]
*  I don't know what I just heard. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3519.98s)]
*  In fact, I want to just show you another perfect example of this. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3522.38s)]
*  And look, oftentimes when we talk about the pro-war propaganda, [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3525.58s)]
*  it's usually in the context of Fox News. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3529.42s)]
*  And to be fair, Fox News has had wall to wall pro-war propaganda ever since [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3531.3s)]
*  the idea of bombing Iran or doing a regime change war in Iran started. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3536.1400000000003s)]
*  With that in mind though, also consider that CNN likes to air this type of [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3542.58s)]
*  pro-war propaganda quite often as well. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3546.7000000000003s)]
*  And you're going to get a little taste of it right here. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3549.3s)]
*  The individual that you're going to hear from is conservative commentator [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3551.9s)]
*  Jonah Goldberg responding to Marjorie Taylor Greene. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3555.14s)]
*  Let's watch. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3558.02s)]
*  She posted on X, it feels like a complete bait and [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3559.62s)]
*  switch to please the neocons, Wanger's Military Industrial Complex contracts and [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3563.54s)]
*  neocon TV personalities that MAGA hates and who work with Trumpers. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3568.5s)]
*  Yeah, well, that's stupid. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3573.7000000000003s)]
*  I mean, part of the thing is, we just, what, a month ago, [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3576.7400000000002s)]
*  Laura Loomer purged the last alleged neocons from the White House. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3580.94s)]
*  There are no neocons, whatever she thinks a neocon is, [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3585.1800000000003s)]
*  other than some sort of perfidious bagel-snarfing warmonger. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3588.26s)]
*  There are none in the White House, right? [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3591.6600000000003s)]
*  They've all been purged. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3593.14s)]
*  Anyone who's suspected of neocon, of being a neocon has been purged. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3594.14s)]
*  This isn't the Nikki Haley people making these calls. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3597.94s)]
*  This is Trump and his team doing this. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3600.34s)]
*  Okay, so Jonah Goldberg is playing dumb because as we know and [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3604.2200000000003s)]
*  as we've seen through her posts on X, Laura Loomer is a neocon and loves neocons and [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3607.86s)]
*  lied about the fact that she has a problem with neocons and got Trump to purge them. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3614.02s)]
*  If you remember, we were skeptical about that whole narrative, right? [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3619.02s)]
*  But at the same time, who serves in Trump's administration, [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3623.9s)]
*  I've learned doesn't actually matter, okay? [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3628.1800000000003s)]
*  What matters is who spoke to Trump last. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3630.26s)]
*  Because remember, Trump had dinner or lunch, I can't remember, it doesn't matter. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3633.94s)]
*  He met with Mark Levin right before he started making really bad decisions in [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3638.9s)]
*  the Middle East. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3643.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3644.78s)]
*  So no, that was hilarious because they read a quote about neocon TV personalities. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3645.82s)]
*  And then a neocon TV personality comes out and says there are no neocons. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3651.58s)]
*  Right. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3655.34s)]
*  And there are none in the White House. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3656.1s)]
*  And there are none in the White House, why? [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3658.46s)]
*  Because Laura Loomer purged them. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3660.46s)]
*  Laura Loomer is a neocon, she's Israel first. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3662.54s)]
*  100%. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3666.38s)]
*  So he's, I mean, what a hilarious liar Jonah Goldberg is. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3667.38s)]
*  I watched the rest of it, then he went on to say, you know what, [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3671.98s)]
*  I normally disagree with Trump, but this strike against Iran was a really good idea. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3674.86s)]
*  So really, now that he did something Israel wants, and [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3680.42s)]
*  neocon TV personality like you decided that you all of a sudden like Donald Trump. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3684.3s)]
*  Bingo. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3690.02s)]
*  Funny how that works against Israel's interest. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3690.54s)]
*  Terrible, I can't stand him in favor of Israel's interest. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3693.74s)]
*  Donald Trump is so good. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3698.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3700.86s)]
*  There are no neocons. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3701.38s)]
*  So let's do Jonah Goldberg a favor, okay? [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3702.2599999999998s)]
*  You're about to hear from Mark Levin, the guy who met with Trump, [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3705.66s)]
*  right before Trump decided to engage in this conflict with Iran. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3709.7799999999997s)]
*  So Levin not so happy about the ceasefire that was reached between Israel and [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3715.58s)]
*  Iran recently. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3721.14s)]
*  In fact, why don't we hear what he had to say? [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3722.46s)]
*  I hate this word ceasefire. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3725.34s)]
*  It really did. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3726.7799999999997s)]
*  The president hated it a few days ago too. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3727.2999999999997s)]
*  What's needed now is this in my humble opinion. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3729.54s)]
*  Iran should be forced to sign a surrender document, [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3732.18s)]
*  unconditional surrender. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3736.8199999999997s)]
*  They lost their nukes, they've lost their air force, [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3738.42s)]
*  they have no ground to air protection. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3740.62s)]
*  China didn't step in, Russia didn't step in, [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3742.74s)]
*  not a single Arab country stepped in. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3745.18s)]
*  The supreme Nazi is hiding in a bunker much like Adolf Hitler did. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3747.46s)]
*  Adolf Hitler wasn't thrown a life line. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3752.14s)]
*  He was going to be killed, so he committed suicide. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3754.1s)]
*  So he hates the word ceasefire. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3759.54s)]
*  He loves war, very, very upset. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3761.62s)]
*  He's like- There are no neocons. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3764.14s)]
*  There are no neocons. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3765.66s)]
*  And there are no neocons on TV or radio either apparently. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3766.74s)]
*  I mean, look, that was hilarious in a couple ways. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3770.46s)]
*  So first of all, he says- [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3772.78s)]
*  And they should be forced into an unconditional surrender. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3774.26s)]
*  Okay, so obviously they're never going to agree to that. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3778.42s)]
*  And hence permanent war. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3780.78s)]
*  That means you have to have ground troops for [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3782.78s)]
*  them to unconditionally surrender. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3784.42s)]
*  You have to find the Nazi in his bunker. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3786.6200000000003s)]
*  And so you have to go in with American troops. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3789.5800000000004s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3792.34s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3793.1000000000004s)]
*  Okay, hey, why doesn't Israel go in with their troops? [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3793.82s)]
*  That's anti-Semitic. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3795.98s)]
*  Now you can't have Israelis dying. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3798.1400000000003s)]
*  The Israelis are worth 1,000, 10,000, [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3799.9s)]
*  1,000,000 American. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3801.94s)]
*  I mean Arab. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3803.26s)]
*  I mean lives. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3804.3s)]
*  Okay, yeah, that's what I thought, Mark. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3805.78s)]
*  That's what I thought. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3806.98s)]
*  No, you want us to fight this war for you. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3807.7400000000002s)]
*  So the minute that Trump does a ceasefire, remember this is same [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3809.9s)]
*  Mark Levin for the last couple of days as Trump did the bombing was like, [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3812.58s)]
*  you have to listen to what Trump says. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3816.38s)]
*  Trump is MAGA. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3817.9s)]
*  Trump defines MAGA. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3818.86s)]
*  Trump is American bird. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3820.1s)]
*  And you have to listen to Trump. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3821.58s)]
*  The minute Trump says ceasefire, don't listen to Trump. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3823.34s)]
*  Listen to Israel instead. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3825.82s)]
*  Okay, we got him, Mark. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3827.86s)]
*  We got it. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3828.82s)]
*  For God's sake, move to Tel Aviv where you'll be happy, [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3829.94s)]
*  they'll be happy, everybody will be happy. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3832.3s)]
*  Look, to say that Jews have dual loyalty is absurd, absurd. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3835.38s)]
*  John Stewart talked about it the other day. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3840.7400000000002s)]
*  He's like, I have loyalty to Jersey. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3842.3s)]
*  That's where I grew up. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3845.2200000000003s)]
*  That's my homeland, right? [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3846.14s)]
*  I feel the same way, right? [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3847.58s)]
*  And our ethnic backgrounds are different. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3849.38s)]
*  Our cultural backgrounds are the same because we both grew up in New Jersey, [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3851.94s)]
*  right? [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3854.78s)]
*  So but for guys like Mark, they can't understand that because they do have [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3855.5s)]
*  dual loyalty and they think following Israel's orders is paramount, paramount. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3859.34s)]
*  Look, you're allowed to have that opinion and [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3865.98s)]
*  I'm sure there's some Norwegian Americans who think Norway's more important than America. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3868.06s)]
*  Norway's doing well. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3871.98s)]
*  It happens, it happens. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3873.54s)]
*  Norway doesn't need any help. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3874.7400000000002s)]
*  Okay. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3875.94s)]
*  Don't judge anybody else based on Mark Levin's comments or actions. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3876.46s)]
*  But he definitely is not anywhere near America first. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3879.6200000000003s)]
*  And lastly, CNN, at least for now, [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3883.46s)]
*  CNN is the one who brought on Jonah Goldberg. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3886.2599999999998s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3889.66s)]
*  I just wanted to, yeah, Jonah Goldberg, Mark Levin, etc, are neocons, I get it. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3890.2999999999997s)]
*  But CNN doesn't label him a neocon. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3894.8199999999997s)]
*  They let him pretend as if he's objective and then says this absurd Trumpian type of [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3897.22s)]
*  thing where he says there are no neocons. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3903.54s)]
*  And CNN doesn't challenge him at all because CNN is kind of neocon. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3906.02s)]
*  That's why they're playing around with their polls. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3911.18s)]
*  That's why all of a sudden they've got breaking news. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3913.3s)]
*  We did not destroy the nuclear facilities. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3916.34s)]
*  We have to go back in for more. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3918.6200000000003s)]
*  This is the same CNN that drove us into the Iraq war. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3920.5400000000004s)]
*  Abby Phillips' show, which is the prime time slot, is performing really well. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3924.9s)]
*  And I don't think that's an accident. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3929.46s)]
*  I think it's performing well because she consistently has a panel of [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3930.6200000000003s)]
*  diverse opinions debating each other each night. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3935.5s)]
*  And so- I'm shocked they let her do that. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3939.1800000000003s)]
*  I love it. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3940.94s)]
*  By the way, it's the most interesting show on CNN. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3941.62s)]
*  It is, it just is. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3943.74s)]
*  Yeah, because you're at least exchanging opinions. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3944.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3947.02s)]
*  Every once in a while a progressive sneaks on there or [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3947.54s)]
*  a populist sneaks on there. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3949.58s)]
*  A populist sneaking onto CNN is unheard of. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3950.9s)]
*  They generally speaking, they despise populists and they don't know that. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3954.34s)]
*  They just think like, they don't have credibility. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3958.2599999999998s)]
*  They don't have elite status. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3962.14s)]
*  Please go away. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3963.8199999999997s)]
*  Neocon, you have such elite status. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3964.94s)]
*  Really, do they? [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3967.38s)]
*  How did they earn it? [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3968.2999999999997s)]
*  Did you know that Jonah Goldberg was part of a magazine that sold to 87 or [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3969.38s)]
*  maybe 88 different people? [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3973.06s)]
*  Everyone online has audiences a thousand times, a million times larger than [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3975.82s)]
*  Bill Kristol, Jonah Goldberg, or any of these neocons. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3981.34s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3985.46s)]
*  Yeah, they have credibility according to CNN. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3986.1000000000004s)]
*  But hey, at least they do a one show. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3988.06s)]
*  All right, we gotta take a break. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3989.7400000000002s)]
*  When we come back, let's talk about podcasts, okay? [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3990.98s)]
*  Let's talk about podcasts. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3994.58s)]
*  Theo Vonn has Sassy Massey on, okay? [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3996.02s)]
*  Let's talk about their conversation. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=3999.18s)]
*  And a conversation I did not expect to hear on Tucker Carlson's show, [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4001.18s)]
*  full blown anti-war conversation with a former Fox News host. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4006.5s)]
*  We'll talk about who that host is, what they're saying, and [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4011.98s)]
*  more when we come back. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4013.8599999999997s)]
*  We keep our viewers informed while also providing perspective and [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4029.14s)]
*  insight on the news we cover. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4032.46s)]
*  So you understand not only what's happening, but [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4033.98s)]
*  also what's happening behind the scenes, the stories behind the stories. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4036.46s)]
*  We play musical chairs and put these children in one awful detention facility [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4040.3399999999997s)]
*  to the next. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4044.46s)]
*  That's what's happening at the border. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4045.14s)]
*  The things that got him banned, he's still spreading. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4046.54s)]
*  So presumably, I think it's reasonable to say that if you allow him back on [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4049.02s)]
*  the website, he's going to do it again. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4051.8199999999997s)]
*  Any legal voter that we deem not willing to vote for my side shouldn't vote because [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4053.18s)]
*  it'll replace me that's supposed to vote for my side. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4057.9s)]
*  That's not how voting works. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4060.54s)]
*  That's not how democracy works. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4061.54s)]
*  And while many people following today's political news can get discouraged about [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4062.94s)]
*  the direction of the nation and the world, that's not us. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4066.46s)]

*  The rising generation of young people are also overwhelmingly progressive in their [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4081.98s)]
*  political beliefs and policy objectives. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4085.58s)]
*  And they're increasingly flexing their muscle as voters and [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4087.82s)]
*  activists to demand change from our elected officials. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4090.78s)]
*  The traditional mainstream media is mostly AWOL. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4094.34s)]

*  have been captured by corporate interests. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4100.02s)]

*  even the truth from once trusted outlets, [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4104.66s)]

*  Well, I gotta say, I've been kind of impressed with podcasters, Theo Von and [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4293.7s)]
*  his willingness to speak out in regard to what he's been seeing in Gaza. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4298.34s)]
*  Just recently, he was approached by someone who asked, [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4303.26s)]
*  if you could say one thing, what would you say? [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4306.7s)]
*  He said free Palestine, so I love it. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4308.3s)]
*  Now, there's another story involving Theo Von and [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4310.94s)]
*  Thomas Massey that I wanted to get into. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4314.78s)]
*  So without further ado, let's get into it. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4316.74s)]
*  It starts to feel like America is just a shell company, an LLC for Israel. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4319.38s)]
*  I wouldn't send him a dime, that's my position. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4325.46s)]
*  I don't think whatever we're getting isn't worth it. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4329.02s)]
*  And don't ask me to articulate the benefit because I think the cost is greater [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4332.58s)]
*  than the benefit. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4337.18s)]
*  Everybody in Gaza at this point has to hate Israel, right? [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4338.86s)]
*  And by extension, those bombs, when they see American politicians go over there and [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4343.38s)]
*  sign the freaking bombs that are gonna kill women and children. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4347.62s)]
*  Thomas Massey is absolutely correct about that. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4352.98s)]
*  And that's the gentleman you heard in that clip yesterday. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4355.38s)]
*  Representative Thomas Massey, of course, joined Theo Von for [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4359.3s)]
*  a wide ranging interview that also happened to touch on the topic of Israel and [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4362.46s)]
*  what's currently going down in Gaza. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4368.26s)]
*  Now, we'll start with Massey's thoughts on the ongoing genocide in Gaza. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4370.98s)]
*  Let's watch him talk about the sheer scale of death and destruction. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4375.06s)]
*  What do we get from Israel, do you feel like? [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4380.740000000001s)]
*  We got a lot of countries that hate us, is one of the things we get. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4385.02s)]
*  Well, especially right now with this stuff in Gaza, [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4389.740000000001s)]
*  I think it's one of the worst PR campaigns I've ever seen in my life. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4391.780000000001s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense to me. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4396.26s)]
*  It's like, it gives their government this extremely evil [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4398.740000000001s)]
*  look to me, and I think to a lot of people. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4404.94s)]
*  Well, rough numbers, there are 2 million people in Gaza and [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4408.299999999999s)]
*  50,000 have been killed, that's 2.5%. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4412.86s)]
*  Like they've killed 1 in 40 people in Gaza. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4416.78s)]
*  If you did that in the United States, if you did 2.5% of 350 million, [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4419.9s)]
*  it'd be almost 10 million people dead in the United States. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4426.74s)]
*  Everybody in Gaza is at this point related to somebody who's been killed. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4430.9s)]
*  Like at least the first cousin had killed. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4435.94s)]
*  And then if you say how many have been maimed, [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4438.78s)]
*  it's probably three or four times that. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4440.66s)]
*  And I want to add to what Massey is saying there, because as he was talking [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4444.94s)]
*  about how everyone in Gaza who's still alive knows at least one family member [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4449.339999999999s)]
*  who died as a result of this current genocide. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4454.5s)]
*  I couldn't help but think about how Israel tends to respond to people who [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4457.179999999999s)]
*  are openly critical of the genocide that's happening in Gaza. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4462.0599999999995s)]
*  I think about people like Miss Rachel, right? [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4467.179999999999s)]
*  Miss Rachel who creates children's content, [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4470.94s)]
*  who is absolutely disgusted by the number of children who have died. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4474.0199999999995s)]
*  Number of children who have been maimed as a result of this genocide. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4479.34s)]
*  She hasn't said anything even close, even close to anti-Semitic. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4483.02s)]
*  She cares about the kids and she gives the kids a voice. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4489.54s)]
*  And she's been dealing with threats. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4493.3s)]
*  She's been dealing with all sorts of horrible treatment from [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4494.860000000001s)]
*  the defenders of Israel. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4498.9800000000005s)]
*  And if you're worried about the way the world perceives you, [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4501.14s)]
*  maybe don't terrorize people who are speaking out against the slaughter of [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4505.820000000001s)]
*  children. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4510.38s)]
*  Yeah, so a couple of things here. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4511.66s)]
*  First of all, a lot of truth telling there. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4515.18s)]
*  And again, I was on the air before the Iraq war, [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4517.18s)]
*  Young Ter Stold was shown Internet history. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4520.78s)]
*  And we never got any of this from Republicans. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4524.0199999999995s)]
*  We never got any of this from any other media. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4527.82s)]
*  It was just us and democracy now. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4530.22s)]
*  Every other media was massively pro-war. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4532.3s)]
*  They would never allow someone to say, hey, what do we get from Israel? [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4534.9s)]
*  Nothing but enemies. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4538.94s)]
*  I wouldn't give Israel another dollar. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4540.7s)]
*  These things were verboten. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4542.22s)]
*  You were never allowed to say that. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4544.18s)]
*  And so, and they could say, Cenk, that's so wrong. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4546.34s)]
*  It was just a coincidence that it was never set on air for [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4550.7s)]
*  about 18 years straight. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4553.5s)]
*  Okay, maybe it was a coincidence, okay? [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4556.22s)]
*  That it was perfectly legal, just nobody wanted to say it, right? [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4559.0599999999995s)]
*  And by legal, of course, what I mean is groupthink, [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4562.22s)]
*  the etiquette of that particular news organization. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4564.94s)]
*  And everybody in the building knew, [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4567.94s)]
*  you're not allowed to criticize Israel. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4569.54s)]
*  If you do, your career will be in massive jeopardy. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4571.22s)]
*  They could pretend that that's wrong, but [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4574.1s)]
*  ask anyone in media when you get them alone, is it true? [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4577.58s)]
*  They're like, yeah, [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4581.74s)]
*  I'm not going to say anything against Israel, are you nuts? [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4582.54s)]
*  Right? [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4585.18s)]
*  So, okay, so now we're in a different world, [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4586.1s)]
*  where people are actually saying things that are true and critical of Israel. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4588.3s)]
*  So, I mean, Theo Vann's kind of like an innocent guy. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4591.66s)]
*  He is, that's what I love, but that's what I love, [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4595.5s)]
*  because he gives the perspective of a normie, right? [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4597.74s)]
*  He's not a super hyper political guy. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4601.66s)]
*  He's just seeing what's happening, and [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4604.7s)]
*  he's telling us what he thinks about it. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4606.62s)]
*  Yeah, and I know Democrats now hate him and [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4609.42s)]
*  everyone in the brosphere because, my God, they had Trump on. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4611.62s)]
*  Well, everyone hates Democrats, so who cares what they hate? [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4615.18s)]
*  No, no, I know, I got you. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4617.34s)]
*  But Theo Vann is not some sort of weirdo, evil MAGA guy, [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4618.58s)]
*  who's part of a conspiracy to lie to everyone to get Trump elected. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4623.22s)]
*  No, he's a normie. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4626.14s)]
*  He's a normie, so a lot of times he doesn't know all the intricate details of [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4627.22s)]
*  the politics, right? [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4630.700000000001s)]
*  And he looked at it before the election like, yeah, [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4632.14s)]
*  the Democrats seem really fake, right? [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4635.22s)]
*  And they do, they do seem really fake, because they are. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4637.860000000001s)]
*  Now, that doesn't mean that you should have voted for Trump, but [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4641.06s)]
*  that's the same kind of like, and you could say, [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4643.54s)]
*  that's the direction where it went badly, right? [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4646.860000000001s)]
*  And that we don't agree with him on that. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4648.9800000000005s)]
*  But the good news is that when he goes in the direction of Israel, he's like, [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4650.74s)]
*  I don't know, it looks kind of evil that they're killing all those people. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4653.9s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4657.74s)]
*  So sometimes you need someone who is not like the world's greatest expert on news [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4659.54s)]
*  to just look at it with a fresh set of eyes. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4664.98s)]
*  Exactly, yes, yep. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4666.86s)]
*  And so, and when Massey says no more money to Israel, there's a faction of MAGA, [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4668.46s)]
*  and definitely not all of MAGA, but a faction that goes, hell yeah, [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4674.74s)]
*  the America First faction, right? [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4678.66s)]
*  Now, if Trump said it, if Trump said no more money to Israel, that's it, [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4680.58s)]
*  we're keeping the money home. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4684.38s)]
*  Which by the way, I talked to MAGA, so I know that's terrible, but [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4686.0199999999995s)]
*  what it happens is then you wind up learning their opinion. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4689.66s)]
*  And so whether it's for good or for bad, and a lot of times it's for bad. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4693.58s)]
*  But in this case, a lot of MAGA doesn't realize that Trump didn't end [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4696.54s)]
*  funding to Israel, they think he did. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4701.74s)]
*  Okay. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4704.46s)]
*  Why would they think that? [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4704.98s)]
*  Because they're misinformed, because they watch right wing shows, and [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4705.66s)]
*  right wing shows say, we cut all funding to the whole world. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4708.94s)]
*  No. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4712.9s)]
*  They never say, except Israel. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4713.339999999999s)]
*  Right, that's true. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4715.379999999999s)]
*  And Egypt, right? [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4715.94s)]
*  Yep. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4717.179999999999s)]
*  Since they never say that, a lot of MAGA thinks he already did cut funding to [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4717.7s)]
*  Israel. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4721.62s)]
*  Right. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4722.219999999999s)]
*  Okay, so now, but if Trump were to actually do that, come out and say, [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4722.74s)]
*  no, that's it, I said no funding to any country, including Israel, and [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4727.0199999999995s)]
*  we're not sending them any more money for this. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4730.86s)]
*  My God, he'd be, nor, all of MAGA would agree with him instantly. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4733.099999999999s)]
*  Then it would go from a faction to all of them. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4737.74s)]
*  So that's the whole right wing. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4740.099999999999s)]
*  We already had most of the left wing. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4741.58s)]
*  The only people that would be left are the people on TV, right? [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4743.26s)]
*  And Washington. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4746.219999999999s)]
*  So it would be the politicians and [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4748.9s)]
*  the television hosts versus the rest of us. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4750.74s)]
*  And that's a battle I want. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4753.62s)]
*  And then by the way, that's not an easy battle to win, [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4755.66s)]
*  because one of the problems with Trump is that he watches TV and only TV. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4759.46s)]
*  And he loves Fox News. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4763.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4764.38s)]
*  Still, yes. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4764.9s)]
*  He'll go on Fox News and Fox News will say, yeah, 98% of the country says you [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4765.58s)]
*  should be Israel's servant. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4769.82s)]
*  And people are like, I don't know, that's what the people want, right? [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4771.34s)]
*  So TV in Washington versus all the rest of us is a battle that I've been waiting [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4773.86s)]
*  for my whole life. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4779.18s)]
*  So with that in mind, let's talk about money. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4780.38s)]
*  Because money in politics serves a huge purpose in regard to getting our [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4783.26s)]
*  politicians to support Israel's causes. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4788.26s)]
*  And Thomas Massey weighed in on that during this conversation. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4790.9s)]
*  Take a look. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4793.9400000000005s)]
*  It's a weird amalgamation of combined interests. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4795.78s)]
*  There's a military industrial complex that is all in for everything APAC is for. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4799.18s)]
*  And before I banned APAC from my office, [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4805.82s)]
*  we used to have conversations that would go something like this. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4808.22s)]
*  You should be for the foreign aid that goes to Israel, because it all comes back [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4813.02s)]
*  to the United States in the form of military spending. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4817.34s)]
*  We're buying it all from American contractors. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4821.42s)]
*  And be like, no, that's not a convincing argument to me. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4824.7s)]
*  America doesn't make money off of war. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4828.74s)]
*  A few people in America do make money off of war, and [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4831.42s)]
*  they make a lot of money off of war. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4834.42s)]
*  So they want the music to keep going, they don't want the music to stop. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4836.46s)]
*  I think I'm going to donate money to Massey's campaign. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4843.099999999999s)]
*  Okay, I wouldn't go that far. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4845.42s)]
*  Why? [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4847.0199999999995s)]
*  You see the rest of the things he thinks. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4847.5199999999995s)]
*  No, no, he thinks all sorts of things I disagree with, okay? [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4849.22s)]
*  In that district, it's going to be a Republican. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4852.259999999999s)]
*  So do I prefer a neo conservative pro war Republican over Massey? [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4855.7s)]
*  Hell no, I don't. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4861.9s)]
*  Yeah, no, I got you. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4863.3s)]
*  I wouldn't go as far as giving him money. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4864.34s)]
*  But I appreciate that he's honest. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4866.0199999999995s)]
*  And look, that's the second thing that he just opened up that we never talk about, [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4868.58s)]
*  which is the military industrial complex. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4872.9s)]
*  Yes. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4874.38s)]
*  So they're like, again, I mean, [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4875.38s)]
*  there's a point I made on the Young Turks dozens of times. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4876.98s)]
*  But to see a right wing congressman make it on a popular online show so [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4879.86s)]
*  that it reaches not just the left wing but a lot of normies, it's beautiful, right? [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4884.66s)]
*  Part of the reason why Israel's so strong is not because of ridiculous anti-Semitic [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4890.299999999999s)]
*  tropes about Jews control the world or whatever. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4894.62s)]
*  No, no, you have met enough Jews, they can't control their own budget. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4896.58s)]
*  Just as friends of mine, but anyway. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4901.9s)]
*  So, but what is true is the military industrial complex is very much lined up [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4904.219999999999s)]
*  with AIPAC. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4909.06s)]
*  So they're like, okay, Israel keeps driving us into wars, and [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4910.06s)]
*  we make billions of dollars off those wars, sometimes trillions of dollars off of [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4913.5s)]
*  those wars. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4916.9800000000005s)]
*  So that is a super powerful combo. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4917.900000000001s)]
*  There's a third group that doesn't get as much involved in the lobbying from what [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4920.22s)]
*  I've seen in the reporting. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4923.5s)]
*  But that also benefits and they're also super powerful lobbying, [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4925.34s)]
*  that's the oil companies. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4928.22s)]
*  because they don't want war in North Korea, that doesn't help anybody, right? [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4929.580000000001s)]
*  But if war in the Middle East will also drive up oil prices. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4933.620000000001s)]
*  And it's the same cost, but a lot more profit for that same oil. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4937.98s)]
*  So the combination of those three lobbies is overwhelming in Washington DC and [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4943.219999999999s)]
*  super hard to fight. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4948.379999999999s)]
*  But you didn't even know you were fighting them until people like us and [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4949.94s)]
*  Massey started exposing them from the left and the right. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4954.0599999999995s)]
*  And so now the battle is joined a little bit, make it a lot more interesting. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4957.419999999999s)]
*  Real quick, we have a poll here in the live chat. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4961.0599999999995s)]
*  Will AIPAC become more or less influential in future elections? [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4964.62s)]
*  because I mean, in 2024, [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4968.98s)]
*  they were the number one donor to members of Congress. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4970.62s)]
*  So if you're saying no, no, no, they'll melt away, you don't know AIPAC, right? [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4974.3s)]
*  So I don't know if they're going to be more or less. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4980.74s)]
*  I do know the popular opinion is now for the first time building against them. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4983.22s)]
*  And that's great, not because they're for Israel, but [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4988.099999999999s)]
*  because I don't want any government controlling us. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4990.66s)]
*  And so that brings us back to anti-Semitism. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4992.22s)]
*  So quick point, because you mentioned Miss Rachel. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4994.34s)]
*  Miss Rachel is a wonderful human being. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4996.66s)]
*  And so she doesn't say anything about Jews or not Jews. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=4998.26s)]
*  She doesn't use any Trump. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5001.38s)]
*  She doesn't do any of that, right? [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5002.3s)]
*  But she's against the genocide. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5003.860000000001s)]
*  And I think these guys who are Israel first guys and neocons, [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5007.62s)]
*  they're making a huge mistake. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5010.820000000001s)]
*  100%. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5012.3s)]
*  Because they're equating anti-genocide with anti-Semitism. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5013.1s)]
*  Don't do that, don't do that. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5017.7s)]
*  Because if you take out the antis, you're saying, if you're for Jews, [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5019.46s)]
*  you're for genocide, no, no, no, no, no, no. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5022.38s)]
*  I never thought of it that way, but [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5025.42s)]
*  that is such a perfect way of framing it, right? [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5026.86s)]
*  That's why it gets so irritated when they keep saying, you're against the Jews. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5030.62s)]
*  It's like, why are you defaming Jewish people? [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5035.26s)]
*  Because there's a lot of Jewish people who are not in favor of what's going on [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5037.42s)]
*  right now in Gaza. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5040.3s)]
*  Yeah, stop doing that. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5041.58s)]
*  And it puts the dual loyalty trope in play. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5042.9s)]
*  You guys are putting that in play, not us. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5046.34s)]
*  Similarly, a lot of the neocons who have been egging on wars in the Middle East and [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5048.18s)]
*  love what's happening in Gaza, they're not Jewish. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5052.860000000001s)]
*  John Bolton, not Jewish. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5055.700000000001s)]
*  Lindsey Graham, not Jewish. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5057.22s)]
*  Yeah, Dick Cheney, not Jewish. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5059.22s)]
*  What are we talking about here? [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5060.820000000001s)]
*  All of those evangelicals who are like- [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5061.900000000001s)]
*  Mike Huckabee? [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5064.18s)]
*  Who are like, yes, Mike Huckabee salivating over the second coming of Christ and [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5065.22s)]
*  all of those who didn't convert to their religion are gonna be perished. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5069.38s)]
*  Yeah, and look, so I'm anti-genocide. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5075.3s)]
*  I have spoken out against what the IDF is doing. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5077.38s)]
*  The IDF wrote my name on a bomb, right? [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5079.14s)]
*  So then if I criticize the IDF, it's because I hate Jews. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5082.38s)]
*  It's ridiculous. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5087.5s)]
*  No, of course not. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5088.5s)]
*  It's because they're writing my name on a bomb that goes to murder women and children. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5089.7s)]
*  So I think there's a pretty legitimate reason. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5094.02s)]
*  So I think that the pro-Israel side is doing even more damage to Israel than they realize [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5096.62s)]
*  because of what Theo Vana is saying. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5102.62s)]
*  He's like, you guys are making yourselves look evil. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5104.54s)]
*  How does that help? [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5107.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5108.7s)]
*  And it's a great question, a simple question, but a great question. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5109.7s)]
*  All right, we gotta take a break. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5111.94s)]
*  When we come back, we'll talk about a former Fox News host who actually left Fox on his [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5113.74s)]
*  own terms and has a lot to say about his time over at Fox. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5119.52s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5123.5s)]
*  All right, back to Super Chat. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5134.5s)]
*  I can't even get out of Super Chat because so many good comments. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5157.46s)]
*  Ridge Rock for now says, Theo Vana would have gladly had Kamala Harris on his show, [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5159.82s)]
*  but like a damn fool, she didn't want to. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5163.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5165.38s)]
*  Is that Theo Vana's fault or the Democrats' fault? [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5166.38s)]
*  Excellent point. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5168.46s)]
*  It is definitely Kamala Harris' fault. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5169.46s)]
*  Keshav Batra writes in, is it bad that I'm typically indifferent to politics and identify [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5171.18s)]
*  someone in the middle who just wants an adult to run the country regardless of whether they're [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5176.98s)]
*  left or right? [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5180.98s)]
*  No, Keshav, that is not bad at all. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5181.98s)]
*  That is perfectly fine. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5184.54s)]
*  And don't let anyone tell you that that's bad. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5186.26s)]
*  Yes, we want a smart, decent person to run the country that doesn't necessarily do 100% [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5188.54s)]
*  of left-wing ideology or 100% of right-wing ideology, by the way, or 100% of my ideology. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5193.900000000001s)]
*  We just want a grown up who's compassionate, honest, strong, smart, and looks out for the [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5200.18s)]
*  American people and not for the donors. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5205.3s)]
*  The donors are in charge, that's the problem. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5208.5s)]
*  BC24 says Trump needs to cut all funding to Israel here. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5210.82s)]
*  Pod4Studio says, Harry Anton comes off as disingenuous to me. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5214.94s)]
*  No one is that enthusiastic in real life. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5219.58s)]
*  Also, Bernie's saying the same thing Cenk is saying, the hate is weird. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5222.259999999999s)]
*  I know, yeah, I know. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5226.379999999999s)]
*  I agree. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5227.379999999999s)]
*  And whenever you ask him that, they get all flustered. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5228.379999999999s)]
*  They're like, because it's problematic that Bernie's saying almost identical things to [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5230.259999999999s)]
*  what I'm saying. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5237.099999999999s)]
*  So that makes it awkward for people pretending to be in favor of Bernie, or they're not pretending. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5238.299999999999s)]
*  It just creates cognitive dissonance, cuz they wanna beat up on me and love Bernie. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5242.74s)]
*  Anthony McClendon writes in, as he usually does with a great point, Trump doesn't care [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5246.46s)]
*  about Israel or Iran. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5250.099999999999s)]
*  He wants credit for bringing peace to the region. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5251.26s)]
*  Netanyahu stole his moment. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5253.46s)]
*  He might actually hold them accountable for his own selfish reasons. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5255.34s)]
*  And then he ends with, I'll take it. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5259.099999999999s)]
*  Exactly, Tony, exactly. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5260.9s)]
*  I'll take it. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5262.62s)]
*  I don't care why he does it, I just want the right result. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5264.38s)]
*  Why did Donald Trump prevent hundreds of thousands of civilians dying in a regime change war [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5267.18s)]
*  in Iran? [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5272.9800000000005s)]
*  I don't care. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5273.9800000000005s)]
*  I just care that he stopped it, right? [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5274.9800000000005s)]
*  And if he restarts it, then I'll hate him for it. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5277.02s)]
*  See, it depends on his actions. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5279.18s)]
*  Meghan Bramble says, thank you, Cenk and Anna. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5281.38s)]
*  You guys have given me the confidence to be fiercely anti-war, no matter how much propaganda [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5283.1s)]
*  we're subjected to. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5287.740000000001s)]
*  Damn right. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5288.740000000001s)]
*  I love that, Meghan, thank you. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5289.740000000001s)]
*  Titan says, I just don't understand this coddling narrative. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5291.02s)]
*  We have to talk to these people who have huge audiences and hold all the political power [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5294.18s)]
*  in this country. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5298.42s)]
*  Do we just yell from the void and die screaming? [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5299.42s)]
*  And I don't know, some people think that that's a real strategy. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5303.02s)]
*  But they'll say, you're straw manning us. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5306.3s)]
*  Okay, so what do you wanna do? [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5308.54s)]
*  Yell louder. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5309.54s)]
*  Okay, all right. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5310.54s)]
*  But that's what he's saying. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5311.54s)]
*  By the way, I used to think that was the right strategy. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5312.700000000001s)]
*  And then after 18 years, I'm like, maybe I should try something different. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5315.14s)]
*  Yeah, as always, you're too tough on yourself. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5318.9800000000005s)]
*  You didn't really believe that. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5321.14s)]
*  But anyways, we can debate that another day. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5322.14s)]
*  Becca writes in, but by the way, it's okay to say, hey, we didn't get that right or not. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5324.22s)]
*  Like I said earlier in the show about attacking the Trump voters earlier. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5330.5s)]
*  Becca says, I feel like if we had a multiple party system of all these podcasters and different [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5334.700000000001s)]
*  journalists would be so much more used to working in coalitions and not picking such [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5338.18s)]
*  dramatic sides. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5343.1s)]
*  Yeah, that is definitely true because in a multiple party system, you have to find coalitions. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5344.5s)]
*  Great point. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5349.700000000001s)]
*  And then she says, I joined right as Cenk grabs and yells balls. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5350.7s)]
*  Well, we're gonna have you. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5354.26s)]
*  Nick Mon 55 says Candace Owens is 100% correct and principled on this topic. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5357.66s)]
*  I've been open minded and gave her a chance and was pleasantly surprised. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5362.5s)]
*  And she's not backing down and I respect that. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5366.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I do. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5368.66s)]
*  All right, back on TYT, Jay Ganana with you guys. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5378.86s)]

*  The woke, right? [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5438.24s)]
*  So you're like, I'm not sure that we should have a war with Iran right now and like seem [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5439.24s)]
*  like there are a lot of problems here and like people I know are dying of drug ODs. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5446.72s)]
*  Shut up racist, you're woke. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5451.12s)]
*  It's like, wait, what? [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5452.68s)]
*  People who are clearly working on behalf of a foreign country accuse you of working on [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5454.68s)]
*  behalf of a foreign country. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5459.08s)]
*  It's so amazing. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5460.52s)]
*  Tucker Carlson had former Fox News host Clayton Morris on his show on his podcast. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5463.96s)]
*  And it was an hour and a half of neocon bashing. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5470.4800000000005s)]
*  It was incredible. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5474.8s)]
*  And before we get to all the different elements of that conversation, which by the way covered [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5476.12s)]
*  the lies that persuaded Americans to support the preemptive war in Iraq. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5482.7s)]
*  There was also a conversation about how neocons are actually liberals. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5490.28s)]
*  I actually wanna discuss that in a moment as well. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5493.8s)]
*  I do wanna address what you just heard in that clip because I too have been accused [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5496.24s)]
*  of being woke because I'm against supporting Israel based on identity politics. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5501.679999999999s)]
*  And I'm also against clearly what they're doing in Gaza and what they're doing in the [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5509.08s)]
*  West Bank. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5513.2s)]
*  And so who called me woke? [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5514.28s)]
*  Well, Constantine Kissin, who's one of the hosts over at Trigonometry. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5515.8s)]
*  That's also a podcast. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5519.72s)]
*  I was responding to criticism over my demeanor, how I handled myself on Piers Morgan's show [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5521.64s)]
*  yesterday. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5529.400000000001s)]
*  And I'm sorry, when you have an IDF spokesperson gaslighting the hell out of people and pretending [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5530.8s)]
*  like a genocide isn't a genocide. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5536.360000000001s)]
*  When you have him smiling and smirking as I'm talking about the slaughter of innocent [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5538.820000000001s)]
*  people, I get a little offended by that. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5542.280000000001s)]
*  I get a little worked up. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5544.4400000000005s)]
*  And so I wrote polite debates with men who smirk as I bring up the slaughter of innocents [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5545.52s)]
*  is nonsensical to which Constantine Kissin says, woke is so back baby with a laughing [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5549.599999999999s)]
*  emoji. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5555.48s)]
*  So this whole thing about wokeness, I wanna address it real quick. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5556.799999999999s)]
*  Wokeness is identity politics on steroids, okay? [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5560.799999999999s)]
*  It's basically basing your opinion on the identity of the group that you're either defending [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5564.16s)]
*  or speaking out against. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5569.719999999999s)]
*  In this case, people like Constantine Kissin, who as far as I know, isn't American, isn't [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5572.12s)]
*  Israeli, but for whatever reason seems to be obsessed with providing cover for the genociders [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5577.76s)]
*  in Israel. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5583.400000000001s)]
*  Thinks that it's woke to be concerned about said genocide, about the slaughter of innocent [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5585.04s)]
*  people. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5590.280000000001s)]
*  And what are you basing your opinion on other than the identity of the people that you are [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5591.8s)]
*  providing cover for, of the Israelis? [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5597.76s)]
*  For me, it doesn't matter if we're talking about civilian deaths on the Israeli side [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5600.360000000001s)]
*  or the Palestinian side. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5605.08s)]
*  Take a look at how I covered what happened on October 7th on this show. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5607.56s)]
*  How enraged I was about the civilians that were slaughtered by Hamas, because those are [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5612.240000000001s)]
*  human beings. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5616.64s)]
*  I don't see them as any different than Palestinian civilians. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5617.64s)]
*  But for whatever reason, for Constantine Kissin, it's totally okay to value civilian lives [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5622.120000000001s)]
*  on one side and just brush aside all of those tens of thousands of civilians who have been [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5628.200000000001s)]
*  killed on the Palestinian side. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5635.84s)]
*  That's identity politics on steroids. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5638.56s)]
*  That's what's woke. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5641.2s)]
*  Yeah, so first of all, I think the whole conversation is nonsense, to be honest, because they just [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5642.2s)]
*  call whatever they're against woke. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5647.0s)]
*  They're not even trying to make sense. [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5649.16s)]
*  Which is what stupid people do. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5650.28s)]
*  Right. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5651.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5652.4400000000005s)]
*  But now the problem for them is that when they do it against people that are also on [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5653.4400000000005s)]
*  the right, like Tucker Carlson and Marjorie Taylor Greene, they are exposed for being [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5655.76s)]
*  the dumbasses that they are. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5662.24s)]
*  So they were oftentimes just as dumb when they accused everyone on the left of being [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5664.24s)]
*  vote woke. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5669.0s)]
*  And they'd say absurd things on this slightly. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5670.0s)]
*  It's a bit of a tangent, but it's similar concept, which is they're like Kamala Harris [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5672.84s)]
*  is a communist and a Marxist. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5677.04s)]
*  She's a corporatist. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5679.76s)]
*  She works for the corporate donors, which is terrible. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5681.08s)]
*  But that's the opposite of Marxism and communism. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5683.84s)]
*  Try to make sense, right? [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5686.4s)]
*  And so this woke thing is similar. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5687.94s)]
*  They're like, you're all woke. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5689.2s)]
*  What does that mean, right? [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5690.5199999999995s)]
*  So in this case, so if woke has any meaning at all, it's identity politics gone wrong. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5692.58s)]
*  Right? [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5697.94s)]
*  Yes. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5698.94s)]
*  And so, okay, well, you guys are saying that we're not allowed to criticize Israel because [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5699.94s)]
*  we're anti-semitic. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5705.86s)]
*  So that's a different way of saying bigot or racist. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5707.32s)]
*  100%, yes. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5709.74s)]
*  So you're shutting down the conversation with identity politics. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5711.0599999999995s)]
*  So if woke has any definition at all, it's that. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5715.78s)]
*  And by the way, that is also not uncommon. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5722.3s)]
*  This happens way more on the right, where they're guilty of something and they do projection. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5725.34s)]
*  And Israel's also the king of this. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5731.74s)]
*  They're like, my God, the Iranians are killing women and children in Israel. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5733.22s)]
*  You just killed 40,000 women and children in Gaza, right? [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5738.68s)]
*  And so they're like, that is the worst kind of terrorism. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5743.14s)]
*  I'm like, I kinda agree. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5745.34s)]
*  And that's why I'm bothering you guys to do more. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5746.820000000001s)]
*  But they just keep on going. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5748.780000000001s)]
*  And in this case, they're like, you're anti-semitic and you're bigot and your voice should be [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5750.18s)]
*  shut down and you shouldn't be allowed to ever criticize Israel. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5756.14s)]
*  That's why I don't do identity politics. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5759.700000000001s)]
*  No, that is identity politics. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5761.54s)]
*  And if anything is woke, that's woke. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5764.34s)]
*  Now, now that we've gotten that out of the way, let's move on to you're gonna love this [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5766.54s)]
*  Jink. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5770.58s)]
*  This is totally your wheelhouse. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5771.58s)]
*  Probably after we come back from this video, I should just leave because you're gonna love [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5773.1s)]
*  this and you're gonna wanna talk about it forever. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5776.1s)]
*  They get into the inner workings of corporate media and how they drum up support for war. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5778.28s)]
*  Take a look. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5784.24s)]
*  MSNBC, we learned, had a two for one official booking plan that meant two pro-war voices [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5786.24s)]
*  for every one anti-war voice. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5798.2s)]
*  It's such an important piece of this to have that propaganda piece of this, the manufacturing [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5800.62s)]
*  of consent for war. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5807.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5808.46s)]
*  And we have, again, a long history of this. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5809.46s)]
*  You don't do it without the newspapers. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5811.2s)]
*  You don't do it without the television stations. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5812.66s)]
*  You don't do it without the Fox News or the CNNs, the MSNBCs. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5814.68s)]
*  You're totally right. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5817.96s)]
*  I mean, CBS changed the name of their show to Showdown with Saddam. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5818.96s)]
*  Hi, I'm Clayton Morris, host of Showdown with Saddam. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5823.16s)]
*  We haven't attacked them yet, but that's the name of my show. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5827.46s)]
*  Welcome to, we're replacing Phil Donahue with Countdown Iraq. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5832.84s)]
*  So you're framing all of this ahead of time. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5837.52s)]
*  The propaganda is there ahead of time. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5842.28s)]
*  So it's all being laid out. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5844.88s)]
*  It's basically, it becomes an inevitability that we are going to attack. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5847.32s)]
*  But the show should have been called, What the Hell Does Saddam Hussein Have to Do with [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5850.68s)]
*  9-11? [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5853.88s)]
*  Go ahead, Cenk. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5856.52s)]
*  Yeah, 100%. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5857.52s)]
*  Well, that's what we were saying on the air on The Young Turks before the war began and [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5858.52s)]
*  after the war began. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5862.5s)]
*  And Ana's right, because this is literally chapter five of my book, Justice is Coming. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5865.14s)]
*  It's called The Matrix, and it's about how corporate media is the number one weapon for [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5868.82s)]
*  corporate rule. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5873.74s)]
*  So whenever corporate interests are aligned, you will have MSNBC, CNN, and Fox News all [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5875.14s)]
*  agree. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5881.18s)]
*  And we showed you a pretty spectacular case of that yesterday when we showed you all three [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5882.18s)]
*  cable news shows going, that'll boy Donald Trump, way to attack Iran. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5886.5s)]
*  Same exact thing they did before the Iraq war. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5891.66s)]
*  Now if you're wondering why, well, there's a couple of reasons why. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5893.38s)]
*  So as I explained in the book, and I mentioned Phil Donahue that Clayton Morris just mentioned [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5897.0599999999995s)]
*  there as well. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5901.26s)]
*  What MSNBC did back then was, anyone that was on the air that was against the war, they [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5902.94s)]
*  took them off. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5908.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5909.0199999999995s)]
*  Phil Donahue was their number one rated show. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5910.0199999999995s)]
*  They took him off the air because he was against the Iraq war. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5911.0199999999995s)]
*  Ashleigh Banfield was this new star that they had stolen from another station. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5913.0199999999995s)]
*  They were so proud of her. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5917.78s)]
*  She covered 9-11, was a big up and coming star. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5919.0s)]
*  She did a speech explaining the downsides of war. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5921.54s)]
*  She didn't even state an opinion, but she just explained war is ugly and terrible, etc. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5925.14s)]
*  She did that speech in Kansas off the air, they're like, that's it. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5929.34s)]
*  Not only was she taken off the air, this is the amazing part. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5932.74s)]
*  They wouldn't let her out of her contract so that she couldn't say that on anyone else's [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5936.58s)]
*  air. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5942.18s)]
*  And then they moved her office into a closet so that everyone in the building can see, [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5943.44s)]
*  If you speak out against war, you're gonna get stuffed into a closet. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5949.38s)]
*  It was so sick. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5953.14s)]
*  It was so sick. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5954.14s)]
*  It was so sick. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5955.14s)]
*  I remember. [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5956.14s)]
*  And then Jesse Venturo was on the show. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5957.14s)]
*  And Jesse says a lot of wacky things, right? [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5958.900000000001s)]
*  But he also says some things that are true and that could happen. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5961.900000000001s)]
*  Same with Tucker. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5964.54s)]
*  Tucker says a lot of wacky things and he's right about Israel and war in this case, right? [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5965.54s)]
*  But Jesse explained something that I know is true because his co-host on the pilot for [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5969.900000000001s)]
*  his MSNBC show was Ben Mankiewicz, my co-host at the time on The Young Turks, right? [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5974.26s)]
*  They gave him a two, MSNBC gave him a $2 million contract, okay? [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5979.18s)]
*  Then after they gave him the contract, they realized he was anti-war. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5983.38s)]
*  So they said forget it, keep the money and we just don't go on air, okay? [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5987.46s)]
*  Wow. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5992.12s)]
*  So now why did MSNBC do that back in the day? [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5993.12s)]
*  At the time, it was owned by GE that predominantly made its money as a defense contractor, okay? [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=5995.4800000000005s)]
*  Which they never ever revealed on air. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6002.740000000001s)]
*  GE also made a killing in rebuilding Iraqi infrastructure. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6004.7s)]
*  So they made money destroying the infrastructure and making the infrastructure. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6010.62s)]
*  That's why TV was a tiny piece of their corporation. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6014.5s)]
*  And that's why later they sold MSNBC, they didn't really care, cuz it had gotten the [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6019.02s)]
*  job done. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6022.36s)]
*  It served its purpose of marketing for the really profitable parts of GE, which is war [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6023.78s)]
*  making, right? [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6028.9800000000005s)]
*  And so a lot of those defense contractors are also advertisers on cable news. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6030.44s)]
*  Yes. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6035.679999999999s)]
*  That's another incentive. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6036.679999999999s)]
*  Plus, the lying politicians are the number one advertisers on cable news. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6037.679999999999s)]
*  Cuz for example, in this election cycle, we spent $16 billion, most of it went into mainstream [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6042.28s)]
*  media. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6047.599999999999s)]
*  So all those politicians are their clients, their sponsors, their brands, that they're [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6048.599999999999s)]
*  backing. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6053.2s)]
*  So those politicians are owned by the military industrial complex, APAC, big drug companies, [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6054.2s)]
*  etc. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6059.24s)]
*  So they go and lie and say, we want war, war is great. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6060.24s)]
*  They go, this is our top client. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6063.12s)]
*  They want war, we want war. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6065.5199999999995s)]
*  Yes, war is great. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6067.12s)]
*  You showdown with Saddam. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6068.2s)]
*  So that's how that sausage gets made. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6069.96s)]
*  So I wanna go to the next clip in regard to Tucker Carlson getting reprimanded when he [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6073.719999999999s)]
*  worked over at CNN. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6081.2s)]
*  Before he worked at Fox, he did work at CNN, he ended up getting fired. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6082.84s)]
*  And he talks about one of the things he did that got him into a lot of trouble. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6087.0s)]
*  Let's go to D3. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6090.839999999999s)]
*  I made the mistake of reading Osama Bin Laden's manifesto on CNN. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6092.92s)]
*  Not an endorsement of Osama Bin Laden, obviously. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6099.0s)]
*  Right, but it's news. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6101.16s)]
*  Well, I just think it's important to know why people do things. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6102.16s)]
*  You can disagree completely, but I think it's important to be honest about other people's [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6105.839999999999s)]
*  motives. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6109.48s)]
*  And so I read this, maybe it's all made up or whatever. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6110.48s)]
*  Can you trust Osama Bin Laden? [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6113.799999999999s)]
*  But I think, do I like Osama Bin Laden? [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6116.040000000001s)]
*  No, obviously. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6118.96s)]
*  But I'm an American, but I think it's important to know at least what he said about why he [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6119.96s)]
*  did it. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6125.88s)]
*  And the two reasons, there are a number of reasons, but the two big ones were you've [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6127.8s)]
*  got US forces on the Saudi Peninsula, two most holy cities in Islam, Mecca and Medina. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6131.080000000001s)]
*  That's offensive to me. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6139.320000000001s)]
*  And the second reason was you're in critical support of Israel. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6140.64s)]
*  I read this on the air at CNN, whoa, whoa, shouldn't have done that. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6143.64s)]
*  I was immediately denounced as an anti-Semite. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6147.52s)]
*  So he worked over at CNN between 2001 and 2005. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6151.8s)]
*  Those were my high school years and I was not watching cable news, so I didn't even [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6155.68s)]
*  know that that happened. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6158.76s)]
*  Do you remember that? [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6159.76s)]
*  Yeah, and so if you reference Osama Bin Laden's manifesto, you were gonna get called an anti-Semite. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6161.0s)]
*  Of course that doesn't make any sense. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6170.52s)]
*  You're not- [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6171.96s)]
*  You're endorsing it. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6172.96s)]
*  I read the Unabomber's manifesto, that doesn't make me a bomber. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6173.96s)]
*  I wanted to know why he did it. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6177.36s)]
*  Right. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6178.92s)]
*  I'm in the news business. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6179.92s)]
*  We're supposed to find out why they did it, right? [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6180.92s)]
*  So that's why it's very curious when news organizations say don't do the news. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6183.96s)]
*  Don't tell people why he did it. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6190.72s)]
*  It could be that he did it for a terrible reason. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6192.6s)]
*  It makes us hate him more, not less, right? [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6194.84s)]
*  And it doesn't matter, you kill 3,000 Americans, we're gonna hate him anyway, right? [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6197.16s)]
*  And what a weird thing to say that reading why he did it makes someone an anti-Semite. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6201.16s)]
*  What? [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6207.4400000000005s)]
*  Why are those two things connected? [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6209.64s)]
*  You're telling on yourself. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6212.200000000001s)]
*  What they're accidentally saying to you is, if you find out why Bin Laden did it, it's [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6214.16s)]
*  because of we're supporting Israel. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6219.16s)]
*  Then you'll start to wonder, wait, why are we supporting Israel? [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6222.12s)]
*  And not that you'll agree with Bin Laden, but it'll open up that question. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6226.96s)]
*  And we don't want anyone thinking about that question. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6230.88s)]
*  We want everyone to support Israel. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6234.16s)]
*  But wait, you're a news organization. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6236.8s)]
*  Why do you care about everyone supporting any country? [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6239.4800000000005s)]
*  Imagine if they were all like, no, we have to make sure that everyone is supporting Finland. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6243.68s)]
*  You'd be like, that is awfully strange. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6249.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6252.4s)]
*  Right? [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6253.4s)]
*  If somebody spoke out against Finland, you better, they're gonna get it. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6254.4s)]
*  They're gonna get it talking to you. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6256.5599999999995s)]
*  By the way, when I was on current TV and I said something against Israel or just slightly [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6257.839999999999s)]
*  critical of Israel, I got a call from management. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6261.92s)]
*  Now they didn't, yeah. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6264.24s)]
*  Yeah, they didn't, to be fair to them, they didn't take me off the air. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6265.799999999999s)]
*  They didn't reprimand me. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6270.04s)]
*  They didn't do anything wrong, right? [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6271.04s)]
*  But I did get a call and I- [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6272.5599999999995s)]
*  Wow, I didn't know about that. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6274.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6276.28s)]
*  Drama. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6277.28s)]
*  So it look, but I got a lot of calls at MSNBC. [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6278.28s)]
*  So what people don't realize is they think cable news is real because nobody told them [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6282.12s)]
*  that it was actors and it's all a play, right? [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6287.24s)]
*  What they don't realize is most of the anchors don't even write their own scripts. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6290.44s)]
*  They're just actors. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6295.96s)]
*  They show up, they read the script. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6297.0s)]
*  The final thing I'll get into that I thought was fascinating in this conversation, this [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6299.8s)]
*  is the last video, D6. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6303.44s)]
*  Tucker talks about a phone call he received from the Murdochs after he got fired from [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6306.16s)]
*  Fox News. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6311.36s)]
*  And to me, the conversation, how it went down and what was promised to Tucker gives you [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6312.599999999999s)]
*  a sense of how politics and campaigning really works. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6318.2s)]
*  The Murdochs really hate Trump. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6323.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6324.5199999999995s)]
*  There's no one who hates Trump more than the Murdochs. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6325.5199999999995s)]
*  I mean, I got fired in April of 2023, in May of 2023, they asked me to run for president [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6326.5199999999995s)]
*  against Trump and said they would back me. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6333.639999999999s)]
*  Obviously, I'm not gonna run for, I would never get elected, and plus I like Trump. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6336.24s)]
*  I mean, the funny thing is I actually genuinely, I get frustrated, I'm frustrated now. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6342.04s)]
*  So hold on, I'm sorry, you just said that and people buy, I mean, they asked you to [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6346.28s)]
*  run for president against Trump, the Murdochs. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6350.96s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6353.599999999999s)]
*  Lachlan Marks said you should run for president, we'll back you. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6354.599999999999s)]
*  The whole thing, the whole- [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6356.72s)]
*  The whole Fox News apparatus. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6358.84s)]
*  And not just Fox, but, you know, Wall Street Journal, all of their papers, everything. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6359.84s)]
*  Absolutely, yeah, we'll back you. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6364.16s)]
*  And that came right from Lachlan. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6365.16s)]
*  You should do that. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6366.16s)]
*  I was already gone, they already canceled my show. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6367.16s)]
*  I was still under contract, but they canceled my show. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6368.36s)]
*  You should run, we support you, you should run. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6370.66s)]
*  We wanna stop Trump. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6372.58s)]
*  Yeah, well, he was running. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6373.58s)]
*  I thought that was interesting. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6377.98s)]
*  Interesting for a number of different reasons, you can talk about the Murdochs, obviously, [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6379.98s)]
*  not liking Trump and wanting to help a challenger to Trump beat him in the primaries. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6383.5s)]
*  But also the conversation about that whole Fox News apparatus, right? [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6392.18s)]
*  The media apparatus, the Wall Street Journal editorial board, New York Post, I mean, he [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6396.34s)]
*  named all of them in that. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6401.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6403.14s)]
*  What do you think about that? [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6404.14s)]
*  I mean, first of all, if you don't know that Murdoch tightly controls those news organizations [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6405.14s)]
*  and he just has them repeat whatever he wants, you're a babe in the woods. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6411.3s)]
*  It's nice to know you. [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6416.84s)]
*  I mean, hello, welcome to American media. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6417.84s)]
*  Let me just make one quick important distinction, though. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6419.7s)]
*  I think that in the case of the Wall Street Journal, the news side sometimes does break [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6422.26s)]
*  really good stories and it's different from the editorial side. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6426.7s)]
*  The editorial side obviously is very right wing, the editorial board, but should be thought [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6430.34s)]
*  of as different from the news side. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6435.02s)]
*  Yeah, the New York Post doesn't have a news side. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6436.42s)]
*  They claim to have a news side. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6438.42s)]
*  Fox News doesn't really have a news side. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6439.62s)]
*  They claim to have a news side. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6441.1s)]
*  No, it's all propaganda. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6442.22s)]
*  And so that's not surprising. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6443.860000000001s)]
*  Number two, that's not surprising. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6447.280000000001s)]
*  Murdochs have been against Trump from day one. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6448.820000000001s)]
*  They never wanted Trump, why? [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6451.58s)]
*  Cuz he's harder to control. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6453.38s)]
*  So that's got upsides and downsides, right? [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6455.34s)]
*  It has a lot of downsides cuz he's a wild man and he doesn't even know what he's doing, [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6457.5s)]
*  right? [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6461.26s)]
*  And at least instability, etc. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6462.26s)]
*  But the one upside for the rest of us that Trump has is that, well, it's harder for Rupert [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6463.82s)]
*  Murdoch to control him. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6468.88s)]
*  It's harder for the neocons to control him. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6469.98s)]
*  It's harder for Israel to control him. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6471.62s)]
*  I don't know why Rupert Murdoch loves Israel and I don't know why he loves war, okay? [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6473.22s)]
*  But he does. [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6479.6s)]
*  Those are two things that he cares most about. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6480.6s)]
*  Right. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6483.08s)]
*  And he's driven in that direction, not just in American media, but British, Australian [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6484.08s)]
*  media. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6488.08s)]
*  He has been manipulating the whole world to be in favor of wars and Israel for whatever [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6489.08s)]
*  reason, right? [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6493.76s)]
*  And so that's why he's a little worried about Trump because all the other politicians are [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6495.04s)]
*  super easy to control, incredibly easy. [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6499.9400000000005s)]
*  And that's why he makes that offer to Tucker cuz he thinks this Tucker guy, he's been with [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6504.1s)]
*  Fox News and I've given him tens of millions of dollars. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6509.22s)]
*  If he's a good boy and he listens, maybe we can get rid of this Trump guy. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6512.36s)]
*  But when Trump did the bombing of Iran, Fox News flips immediately and they're like, what [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6517.24s)]
*  a beautiful strategic, brilliant move, brilliant, brilliant, more war, yes, we love Trump, right? [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6524.04s)]
*  So he goes for the ceasefire and then Fox is back to, I don't know. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6531.679999999999s)]
*  I know, it's amazing. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6536.68s)]
*  And by the way, Sean Hannity is nothing but Murdoch's boy. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6537.68s)]
*  He is, yeah. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6541.68s)]
*  He's his little pet, okay? [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6542.68s)]
*  He's a good boy. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6543.68s)]
*  Do more propaganda, little boy. [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6545.280000000001s)]
*  And then she goes, yes, master, yes, what should I tell them today? [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6546.96s)]
*  Just put it in the script, I'll read it. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6551.34s)]
*  That blockhead. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6553.200000000001s)]
*  Yep, all right, we gotta take a break when we come back. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6554.200000000001s)]
*  Man, a big update on immigration policies that have been implemented in this country, [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6556.96s)]
*  Supreme Court rulings on it and more, don't miss it, we'll be right back. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6563.64s)]
*  All right, so let's go to YouTube members section now. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6593.64s)]
*  Madame Pree says, I love when Anna rants about Israel being a welfare state and stands [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6600.56s)]
*  up for America and our soldiers. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6604.0s)]
*  Damn right. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6605.76s)]
*  Okay, Zamoukli Tussi writes in, dang, the bros are cooking, referring to Theo Von and [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6606.76s)]
*  the others. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6613.64s)]
*  I hear on other left-wing shows the bros are all fascists, but okay. [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6614.64s)]
*  The Forsaken One, I'm not gonna let it go. [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6619.08s)]
*  The Forsaken One writes, I love TYT and I love Crystal and Kyle. [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6621.36s)]
*  I thought their debate was great. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6626.0s)]
*  I'm still working on not being angry at the Trump voters, but I also understand why they [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6627.839999999999s)]
*  did it. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6632.5599999999995s)]
*  I still think it was the wrong decision, but no reason to make our world smaller. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6633.5599999999995s)]
*  We need the voters. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6637.24s)]
*  There are more Republicans than Democrats now. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6638.48s)]
*  Thank you, Forsaken One. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6640.799999999999s)]
*  Look, and by the way, if you're angry at Trump, that makes perfect sense. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6641.799999999999s)]
*  Trump's done a lot of terrible things. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6646.24s)]
*  And then by association, if you're angry at his voters, I get it, I get it. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6648.32s)]
*  I wrote about it in my book. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6652.44s)]
*  I've talked about it in the past. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6653.679999999999s)]
*  But I love that you were open-minded enough to go, all right, but the correct strategy [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6656.12s)]
*  is they won the popular vote. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6659.5199999999995s)]
*  We need to win it back, right? [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6661.7s)]
*  So excellent, couldn't agree more. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6663.5199999999995s)]

*  Maybe some robes too, huh? [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6698.88s)]
*  So Lydia, with a perfectly fine critique from earlier, wrote in, I feel like I'm getting [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6702.96s)]
*  lectured. [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6707.86s)]
*  Well, Lydia, if they came across that way, I don't mean it that way. [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6708.86s)]
*  But we do a show where we give our opinions. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6711.9s)]
*  But I hear you, and I certainly don't want you to take that away from it. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6714.0199999999995s)]
*  And Nickbond55 says, Cenk, your rant yesterday was so moving. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6718.78s)]
*  Just know that so many of us love and support both you and Anna for covering this awful [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6721.98s)]
*  topic. [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6725.0599999999995s)]
*  Don't let up, they deserve us continuing covering this and not let up at all. [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6726.0599999999995s)]
*  No, as long as the Palestinians are getting killed, I am definitely gonna fight back. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6730.58s)]
*  And so is Anna. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6735.38s)]
*  We appreciate you guys. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6736.38s)]
*  On Twitch, sepacrow1223 said, Cenk never answered if MAGA is a fascist movement. [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6737.86s)]
*  It's like he's triggered by the word fascist. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6743.9400000000005s)]
*  No, I'm triggered by losing voters for no apparent reason at all, because you wanna [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6746.06s)]
*  feel better and have emotional release. [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6750.14s)]
*  It is not good strategy to do that, okay? [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6752.06s)]
*  But you could say no, it is good strategy. [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6754.900000000001s)]
*  If you yell at all the Trump voters and call them fascist, they'll come to your side. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6756.74s)]
*  I don't know how in the world you could reach that conclusion. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6760.900000000001s)]
*  But apparently, some of you have, and certainly almost all the left-wing hosts have, which [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6763.66s)]
*  is amazing. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6767.94s)]
*  Zen sons with another criticism. [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6768.94s)]
*  Trump starts a war and MAGA falls in line. [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6770.74s)]
*  Cenk is still trying to convince us that Trump is pro-peace and MAGA is anti-war. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6772.78s)]
*  But brother, when he did the war, I was livid. [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6777.74s)]
*  And I said F Trump. [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6781.3s)]
*  And then now when he's for a ceasefire, I say, okay, good, I'm glad he's for a ceasefire. [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6783.2s)]
*  You on the other hand apparently think dropping bombs on Iran and ceasefire are the same exact [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6787.8s)]
*  thing, because you don't care about policy. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6794.52s)]
*  Now I am in your grill, okay? [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6797.780000000001s)]
*  And so I think you're saying I'm a tribalist and me hate, and I don't care if we go to [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6800.24s)]
*  war or have a ceasefire, cuz I don't care about policy. [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6806.46s)]
*  I think that's the wrong strategy. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6809.16s)]
*  Back on TNT, Jen Kenana next. [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6847.76s)]
*  Well, the ICE raids continue and that's a bit of a problem, especially when you take [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6859.04s)]
*  a look at who's getting deported, who's getting targeted and even Joe Rogan's sick of it. [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6863.68s)]
*  Bro, these ICE raids are nuts, man. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6868.6s)]
*  Watching this protest on television, it's like- [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6872.2s)]
*  The raids are nuts, the protests are nuts. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6875.6s)]
*  All of it, yeah. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6877.6s)]
*  I think both sides are taking it a little too hard. [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6878.6s)]
*  Well, I don't think if the Trump administration, if they're running and they said we're gonna [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6880.92s)]
*  go to Home Depot and we're gonna arrest all the people at Home Depot. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6886.96s)]
*  We're gonna go to construction sites and we're gonna just tackle people at construction sites. [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6889.92s)]
*  I don't think anybody was signed up for that. [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6893.88s)]
*  They said we're gonna get rid of the criminals and the gang members first. [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6895.6s)]
*  Preach. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6900.400000000001s)]
*  Now last week, Joe Rogan called out the Trump administration for the right reasons for expanding [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6901.88s)]
*  the scope of their ICE raids. [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6907.92s)]
*  And he also had some pretty harsh words for the policeman who shot an Australian journalist, [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6910.6s)]
*  a reporter with a rubber bullet during the LA demonstrations. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6916.56s)]
*  Here's a clip of that. [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6920.24s)]
*  The problem is there's cops that just shoot people with rubber bullets for no reason. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6922.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6925.72s)]
*  Did you see that lady? [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6926.72s)]
*  That's what Australian reporter, the gunshot? [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6927.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6928.72s)]
*  Did you see that video? [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6929.72s)]
*  No. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6930.72s)]
*  I'm not gonna lie to you, guys, cuz you see the guy do it. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6931.72s)]
*  You see the cop. [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6933.76s)]
*  Just look at her while she's talking. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6934.76s)]
*  She's clearly not a criminal. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6936.360000000001s)]
*  She's just reporting the news. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6937.52s)]
*  And he shoots her in the leg with a rubber bullet. [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6938.8s)]
*  I can't believe that he would do this. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6941.08s)]
*  Do you wanna know why people get angry at cops? [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6943.240000000001s)]
*  It's like that. [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6946.320000000001s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6949.240000000001s)]
*  And so when it comes to policing, I am not under any illusion that we don't need police, [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6950.320000000001s)]
*  that we can abolish them and everything will be great. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6955.92s)]
*  No, no. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6958.16s)]
*  We absolutely need to reform policing. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6959.16s)]
*  None of that has happened, which is infuriating. [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6961.36s)]
*  And that cop who shot that reporter with a rubber bullet should not only be fired, but [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6963.719999999999s)]
*  he should be prosecuted for assault. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6968.839999999999s)]
*  Okay, what are you doing shooting a journalist as she's doing her job? [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6970.92s)]
*  She wasn't causing any problems, by the way. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6974.799999999999s)]
*  Anyway, I love that Rogan spoke out about this. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6976.799999999999s)]
*  And I wanna get into some of the details about who's actually being deported in just a second [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6979.88s)]
*  cuz Cato Institute looked into this, but Cenk first. [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6985.08s)]
*  Yeah, so everybody's a little bit wrong here from the two different sides. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6987.68s)]
*  So Rogan's left wing critics say that he doesn't disagree with Trump at all. [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6993.0s)]
*  Well, that doesn't make any sense. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6998.84s)]
*  You just saw it with your own eyes, right? [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=6999.96s)]
*  On the other hand, when Rogan says if he said we're gonna deport people from construction [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7002.0s)]
*  sites and stuff, nobody would have signed on. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7006.56s)]
*  That's also not true. [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7009.360000000001s)]
*  So there is a portion of MAGA that says, yeah, yeah, from construction sites, restaurants, [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7010.92s)]
*  wherever, I don't care. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7015.88s)]
*  You're right about that, yes, you're right about that. [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7017.64s)]
*  But the main point that Rogan's driving towards is true, which is most people, including the [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7021.280000000001s)]
*  decisive voters in the middle that went with Trump, did not sign up for going in the middle [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7028.240000000001s)]
*  of the country and snatching people up. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7034.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, from Home Depot, parking lots, day laborers, really, those are the people who are gonna [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7037.12s)]
*  be targeted? [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7040.360000000001s)]
*  I mean, it's worse than that. [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7041.360000000001s)]
*  There's people that are hiding in attics and some kid climbed a tree to avoid the cops. [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7042.36s)]
*  I mean, it's just madness, right? [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7049.36s)]
*  When unmarked cars show up with ICE agents who are wearing plain clothes and they violently [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7050.799999999999s)]
*  snatch people up. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7059.36s)]
*  And by the way, there's videos of this. [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7060.599999999999s)]
*  You can all watch it. [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7061.88s)]
*  Okay, that scares people across the board. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7063.32s)]
*  That is not what people signed up for. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7066.44s)]
*  So everybody does projection. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7068.16s)]
*  So the MAGA guys that make the mistake of thinking that everybody thinks like they do. [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7069.86s)]
*  And America's gonna love it when people are snatched up off the streets. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7074.54s)]
*  And America doesn't love it. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7078.339999999999s)]
*  The polling shows that America hates it. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7079.48s)]
*  And that's why Rogan has got his finger on the pulse on this one, right? [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7081.7s)]
*  Now he does it on every issue, but on this issue, he's right. [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7084.94s)]
*  And by the way, why is the left, some folks on the left, instinctually say that Rogan's [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7089.78s)]
*  a fascist or with Trump and is part of a cult, etc. [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7095.58s)]
*  Because they're tribalists. [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7100.14s)]
*  And so they assume that Rogan thinks like they do, that he's gonna be tribalist and [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7101.58s)]
*  only support one person or one party, right? [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7106.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7109.78s)]
*  Or one ideology. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7110.78s)]
*  No, in this case, he's looking at it as neutral and he's right about where the American people [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7111.78s)]
*  are. [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7116.0199999999995s)]
*  So I wanna talk a little bit about what the Cato Institute just released in regard to [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7117.0199999999995s)]
*  data pertaining to individuals who have been targeted for deportation. [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7120.74s)]
*  And the numbers are, they should be terrifying for everybody, including American citizens. [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7124.36s)]
*  So as of June 14th, ICE had booked into detention 204,297 individuals since October 1st, 2024, [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7130.36s)]
*  the start of fiscal year 2025. [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7139.5599999999995s)]
*  Of those bookings, 65% or 133,687 individuals had no criminal convictions. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7142.04s)]
*  So this idea that the majority of people who are being targeted have been convicted of [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7149.860000000001s)]
*  serious crimes, that's just a lie, okay? [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7154.32s)]
*  Moreover, more than 93% of ICE bookings were never convicted of any violent offenses. [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7157.16s)]
*  About nine in 10 had no convictions for violent or property offenses, all right? [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7165.56s)]
*  Now again, Cenk is correct to note that there is a sizable portion of Trump voters who don't [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7170.64s)]
*  care. [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7177.96s)]
*  They just want mass deportations, that is absolutely true. [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7179.06s)]
*  But the independents, the lifelong Democratic voters who switched sides in this past election, [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7182.780000000001s)]
*  did they want that? [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7190.780000000001s)]
*  No, so that honestly fragile coalition that Trump was able to build in order to win in [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7191.9400000000005s)]
*  2024, that's gonna fall apart as these targeted disastrous raids that have ended up deporting [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7197.860000000001s)]
*  all sorts of people who haven't actually committed any crimes. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7206.740000000001s)]
*  That's really gonna hurt the Republican brand and the Republican Party. [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7209.22s)]
*  Now, the numbers also illustrate how the Trump administration has shifted its focus from [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7212.4400000000005s)]
*  criminals to any immigrant that they can find. [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7216.8s)]
*  In early January, ICE was arresting about 32 immigrants per day in the interior who [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7219.96s)]
*  had no criminal conviction or pending charge. [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7225.26s)]
*  By early June, these arrests were approximately 453 per day, a 14-fold increase. [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7228.18s)]
*  And as the Wall Street Journal reported, this was all Stephen Miller's plan. [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7235.860000000001s)]
*  Stephen Miller met with ICE and basically said, listen, your numbers are too low, so [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7239.52s)]
*  go for the low-hanging fruit. [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7243.72s)]
*  That was intentional, go to the Home Depot parking lots. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7245.56s)]
*  Finally, I gotta get to the American citizens. [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7248.28s)]
*  Because between 2015 and 2020, ICE deported at least 70 people who were US citizens, according [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7252.12s)]
*  to the Government Accountability Office. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7257.18s)]
*  In total, the Watchdog found that ICE arrested 674 potential US citizens, detained 121, and [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7259.82s)]
*  ended up deporting 70. [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7267.44s)]
*  Okay, other research suggests that that number of American citizens deported by ICE could [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7269.38s)]
*  be far higher. [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7274.92s)]
*  Research by Jacqueline Stevens, a political scientist at Northwestern University, shows [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7276.46s)]
*  that up to 1% of all detainees at immigration detention centers are US citizens. [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7280.46s)]
*  If that 1% figure was constant throughout all deportations, that would mean 4,000 US [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7286.240000000001s)]
*  citizens a year are deported. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7292.3s)]
*  US citizens, I'm not talking about green card holders, I'm not talking about visa holders, [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7294.740000000001s)]
*  I'm talking about American citizens getting deported. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7299.18s)]
*  So a quick point about it is that's why you need due process. [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7302.88s)]
*  Yes. [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7305.62s)]
*  Because without due process, then you're accidentally deporting US citizens, that's unacceptable [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7306.62s)]
*  to everyone. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7310.280000000001s)]
*  So now, I've gotta tell you about one other fact that's critical. [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7311.900000000001s)]
*  So Obama was known as the deporter in chief. [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7315.08s)]
*  Why? [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7317.64s)]
*  He deported more people than any other president. [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7318.64s)]
*  In one year, he did about almost 430,000 removals, right? [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7321.16s)]
*  So why come Obama's policies weren't as inflammatory and controversial as Donald Trump? [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7325.96s)]
*  Is part of it because the media treats Obama better than Trump? [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7333.12s)]
*  Yes, part of it is about that. [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7336.72s)]
*  But there's also a real substantive reason. [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7338.96s)]
*  Because Obama did two things. [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7341.48s)]
*  He did secure cities so that whenever an undocumented immigrant was picked up for a crime and convicted, [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7343.52s)]
*  they were immediately removed, okay? [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7353.360000000001s)]
*  A lot of liberal cities got rid of that and made sanctuary cities. [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7356.080000000001s)]
*  So that is partly why the democratic policies seem to shift. [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7360.68s)]
*  And so we went away from secure cities, but that was working and it was popular and it [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7366.8s)]
*  was aimed at just getting rid of undocumented criminals, okay? [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7371.92s)]
*  But the other thing that he did is he processed them at the border. [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7377.0s)]
*  So instead of just returning them, which Bill Clinton broke the record on removal and return, [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7380.4800000000005s)]
*  both democratic presidents, right? [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7385.88s)]
*  Obama would process them so that if they returned, they would be banned from the country for [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7388.36s)]
*  ten years. [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7393.0s)]
*  If they were returned twice, they'd be banned forever. [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7394.0s)]
*  So that was an efficient way of returning folks, but going through a process to make [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7396.24s)]
*  sure that they didn't have a human rights claim, an asylum claim. [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7401.599999999999s)]
*  So then you do the right thing in treating them legally, but you also return them quicker, [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7405.44s)]
*  right? [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7410.76s)]
*  So it's a win-win. [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7411.76s)]
*  But what Obama didn't do, even as he was breaking records on removal, was go in the middle of [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7413.12s)]
*  the country and uproot people who had been there for ten years, 20 years, five years, [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7418.5199999999995s)]
*  etc., and separate out families. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7423.76s)]
*  That seems much more cruel, and I think it is more cruel. [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7426.18s)]
*  And that is why people are objecting to this. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7430.22s)]
*  And by the way, the reason Stephen Miller told him in early June, you better get going [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7432.62s)]
*  is because it's really bothering them that Trump can't break Obama's record. [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7436.54s)]
*  It's so pathetic. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7441.02s)]
*  It's just, it is. [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7442.02s)]
*  It's so childish and ridiculous. [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7443.02s)]
*  But now they're doing it in a way that is not popular and is driving down their numbers [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7444.9400000000005s)]
*  on immigration. [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7449.46s)]
*  He actually got to an unpopular number on immigration when Trump was sky high in the [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7450.46s)]
*  beginning when he was just sending away the criminals, right? [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7455.1s)]
*  Or we thought the criminals, and then you find out, of course, he did a sloppy job as [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7458.84s)]
*  always, didn't do his homework, and included a whole bunch of people. [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7462.58s)]
*  In fact, a majority of people he shouldn't have sent. [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7466.14s)]
*  I agree, yeah. [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7468.58s)]
*  Yeah, okay, so we gotta go. [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7469.900000000001s)]
*  I've got Tara Palmeri coming up next. [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7472.900000000001s)]
*  She worked at the White House for ABC. [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7474.820000000001s)]
*  She was a CNN, Politico, so many others. [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7477.860000000001s)]
*  Also covered the Epstein file, so it's gonna be a really interesting interview. [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7480.620000000001s)]
*  We'll see you there. [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7484.14s)]
*  All right, back on The Young Turks. [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7725.14s)]
*  We've got a fun interview for you guys today. [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7747.9800000000005s)]
*  Tara Palmeri joins me. [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7750.1s)]
*  She's an independent journalist, author of The Red Letter on Substack, host of The Tara [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7751.38s)]
*  Palmeri Show. [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7755.06s)]
*  But she was also at ABC News, Politico, CNN, PUC, New York Post, Washington Examiner, you [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7756.06s)]
*  name it. [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7762.02s)]
*  She was a White House reporter covering the Trump administration in the first term for [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7763.46s)]
*  Politico. [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7768.62s)]
*  And Sean Spicer said, quote, she's an idiot with no real sources, which is hilarious. [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7769.62s)]
*  Tara, thanks for joining us. [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7775.3s)]
*  So right away, what do you say to Sean Spicer back? [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7779.179999999999s)]
*  I just say consider the source. [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7783.5s)]
*  Is he suing you or something? [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7785.5s)]
*  He threatened to, but yeah, that went away pretty quickly. [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7790.139999999999s)]
*  I don't think it would hold up in court. [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7794.5s)]
*  And also, again, consider the source, Sean Spicer. [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7797.66s)]
*  Yeah, I hear you. [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7801.82s)]
*  We actually had him on the show recently. [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7805.42s)]
*  I wish to get you guys together, or maybe we shouldn't. [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7807.1s)]
*  I don't know about that one. [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7809.18s)]
*  I don't know why I got under his skin. [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7812.18s)]
*  I gotta say, it was really strange to me. [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7814.06s)]
*  I was, he really just didn't like me very much. [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7817.58s)]
*  And I felt like I was pretty fair, but. [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7821.660000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so Tara, that's actually part of what I wanna start with. [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7823.5s)]
*  You also covered the Epstein files, and I wanna get to that too, that's super interesting. [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7826.860000000001s)]
*  And so we had on here Sam Donaldson, probably nearly 20 years ago on The Young Turks. [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7831.179999999999s)]
*  And he told a great story about Rune Arledge, legendary head of ABC News for a long time. [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7839.0199999999995s)]
*  That when Sam Donaldson was the White House reporter for ABC at the time, whenever Reagan [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7845.38s)]
*  called to complain about Donaldson, Rune Arledge would give him a raise. [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7850.78s)]
*  And then later- Yeah, that's the way it should be. [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7855.46s)]
*  So and later when he covered the Clinton administration, Rune Arledge did the same exact thing. [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7859.38s)]
*  So it didn't matter if it was a Republican or a Democrat. [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7863.7s)]
*  But if the administration complained about it, you got a raise. [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7866.06s)]
*  So I'm a little afraid that we've lost those days. [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7868.26s)]
*  But you've covered it. [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7871.54s)]
*  You've been in a lot of mainstream media organizations or legacy media or whatever we wanna call [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7873.22s)]
*  them. [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7877.22s)]
*  So what's your sense of it? [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7878.22s)]
*  Are we still as aggressive against both parties and the powerful or not as much? [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7879.42s)]
*  It's hard because there are these very insider organizations now. [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7886.3s)]
*  There's so many of them. [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7891.900000000001s)]
*  It's so fragmented. [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7893.1s)]
*  And they really are selling on access, right? [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7895.42s)]
*  There's just so many news organizations from Politico to Punchbowl to Axios. [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7899.06s)]
*  And everybody is just trying to get that last scrap, that last little scoop, right? [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7904.820000000001s)]
*  And everybody wants access. [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7910.38s)]
*  And President Trump is obviously not only threatening to cut off access, but he's also [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7912.58s)]
*  threatening to sue on top of all that. [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7917.3s)]
*  And it is suing. [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7919.46s)]
*  Look what happened with CBS having to settle. [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7920.46s)]
*  And so it's putting these major news organizations in a position that is not choosing news, right? [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7923.5s)]
*  They're choosing their business over the news, actual investigative journalism and bringing [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7930.42s)]
*  information to the public, I think. [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7939.54s)]
*  And that's not to say that everyone is corrupt and you can't believe anything that you read [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7942.22s)]
*  in the news. [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7946.860000000001s)]
*  I do think there are a lot of really well-meaning journalists. [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7947.860000000001s)]
*  But I think sometimes when the story gets all the way to management, they can slow roll [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7950.3s)]
*  it if they know it's gonna be a problem. [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7954.14s)]
*  They look at you like you are a problem when you bring in the hard stories. [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7956.22s)]
*  It would be a lot easier for them if you didn't. [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7960.400000000001s)]
*  And so you really have to find some bosses that really believe in you, that wanna make [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7963.02s)]
*  trouble. [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7967.700000000001s)]
*  I mean, a good journalist makes trouble. [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7968.700000000001s)]
*  Yes, yes, couldn't agree more. [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7970.46s)]
*  All right, so let's break that down cuz you said a lot of interesting things there. [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7972.900000000001s)]
*  So people often talk about access, but I think the folks at home, they don't know why the [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7976.14s)]
*  media organizations are obsessed with access. [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7981.42s)]
*  Why? [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7984.14s)]
*  What is it about access that's so important to these media organizations? [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7985.38s)]
*  I personally don't understand why they're so obsessed with access to President Trump [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7989.26s)]
*  when he tweets everything out. [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7993.22s)]
*  There is no mystery. [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7994.58s)]
*  There is no like, he answers the phone for anyone. [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7995.7s)]
*  I called him two weeks ago, he answered the phone and we spoke. [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=7999.46s)]
*  I mean, he's literally the most successful person of all time. [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8001.9800000000005s)]
*  So this idea of trying to get in with the administration is silly. [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8005.62s)]
*  Plus, I don't think he really respects journalists too that are playing just for access to him. [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8008.9800000000005s)]
*  He wants to be loved, that's part of the Trump psychology, right? [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8017.42s)]
*  Trying to win daddy back and that includes with journalists. [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8021.06s)]
*  Why do you think Maggie Haberman has been one of the most successful journalists at [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8023.78s)]
*  The New York Times? [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8028.3s)]
*  President Trump can't win her over. [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8029.58s)]
*  And their relationship goes way back. [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8031.46s)]
*  Actually, Maggie and I used to work in the same newsroom at the New York Post. [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8033.780000000001s)]
*  And that's when I met Donald Trump. [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8037.46s)]
*  I was 22 years old and he used to call me all the time and ask me to write about him [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8038.780000000001s)]
*  running for president. [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8042.9800000000005s)]
*  I literally had to say, Mr. Trump, we can't write about you anymore running for president. [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8043.9800000000005s)]
*  Because you're not. [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8047.38s)]
*  And so that's all to say is like this president, his drug is media. [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8049.06s)]
*  That is his heroin. [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8054.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8055.820000000001s)]
*  He loves to talk to journalists. [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8056.820000000001s)]
*  He picks up the phone at midnight. [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8057.82s)]
*  First of all, Tara, he called you when you were 22. [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8059.62s)]
*  All the time. [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8064.38s)]
*  Wow. [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8065.38s)]
*  I was working at page six. [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8066.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8068.179999999999s)]
*  I was working at page six, which is in the New York to him being in the tabloids in the [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8069.179999999999s)]
*  gossip column, and there was nothing higher. [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8072.54s)]
*  For sure. [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8074.7s)]
*  And sure, I was the 22 year old working at page six. [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8075.7s)]
*  Yes, okay. [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8078.139999999999s)]
*  And both of those things are things he's very attracted to. [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8079.139999999999s)]
*  Anyways, but you're right, the page six stuff with Trump is hilarious. [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8082.259999999999s)]
*  When he would pretend to be John Barron and call in about how he was dating Madonna and [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8086.34s)]
*  stuff. [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8091.02s)]
*  Doesn't get any funnier than that. [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8092.02s)]
*  He stopped pretending with me. [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8093.02s)]
*  I think he was at his political stage at that point and thought like write this down. [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8094.3s)]
*  I'm about to be the president of the United States. [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8098.26s)]
*  It was less about his love life. [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8100.54s)]
*  He was married to Melania. [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8101.860000000001s)]
*  I guess his playboy days were allegedly behind him, not so much as we saw. [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8103.62s)]
*  But it was a bit of a different agenda. [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8107.860000000001s)]
*  But okay, so for Trump, you don't need that much access and he's gonna give it to you [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8111.74s)]
*  anyway. [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8116.14s)]
*  But is it because the editors, the publishers think overall in politics, breaking a story [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8117.14s)]
*  is so important to their business model. [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8124.42s)]
*  And the only way to break stories is if you have access to the politicians with those [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8127.740000000001s)]
*  stories. [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8132.660000000001s)]
*  Is that why they're catering to them more? [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8133.660000000001s)]
*  I think so. [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8137.06s)]
*  I also think with President Trump, I mean, it just gets so much more complicated too. [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8138.06s)]
*  I think you saw what happened with Politico where they cut the subscriptions from the [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8143.7s)]
*  government agencies had to the Politico Pro. [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8148.26s)]
*  That's a huge part of their business model. [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8150.42s)]
*  He can be vindictive. [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8153.34s)]
*  He cut the Associated Press out of the pool and the Associated Press, their business model [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8154.900000000001s)]
*  relies on them putting out wires, being present, physically present at events. [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8160.38s)]
*  And if they're not able to be there to cover them, that puts them at a huge disadvantage [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8166.14s)]
*  when they're competing against Reuters. [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8170.22s)]
*  And so I just think he really knows how to play with the business interests of the press. [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8172.5s)]
*  And I've always believed though, access journalism is not the best journalism. [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8176.9s)]
*  Even when Spicer and I, I'm not even gonna go into it. [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8181.86s)]
*  But even when I was reporting mostly from the outside of the White House, I still felt [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8185.42s)]
*  that I was still breaking stories because I had more time to pick up the phone or to [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8191.1s)]
*  go out and meet with people who don't wanna be seen talking to me, right? [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8198.06s)]
*  I mean, those are the best sources. [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8202.539999999999s)]
*  And those are the best stories. [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8205.019999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's the real shoe leather journalism. [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8206.22s)]
*  The people who are sitting in the briefing room raising their hand and asking the question [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8208.539999999999s)]
*  in front of everyone in America, the performance of it all, the performative nature of it. [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8211.619999999999s)]
*  They're not breaking any big story. [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8215.66s)]
*  But the people who are breaking the big stories, they're behind the scenes hitting the phones [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8217.5s)]
*  and trying to get the scoop. [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8222.34s)]
*  And I think what you see in a lot of the briefing room is jousting. [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8224.779999999999s)]
*  It's important. [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8228.619999999999s)]
*  It's important jousting. [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8229.619999999999s)]
*  And if we need that for public debate and we need to hold people in power to account, [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8230.62s)]
*  I would never say it's not important. [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8234.54s)]
*  But there's a place for all of it. [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8236.58s)]
*  And I think we all just need to understand where we sit into this ecosystem and make [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8239.060000000001s)]
*  sure that the business interests don't, they don't become more important than the public [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8243.26s)]
*  interest, which is public service, which is delivering information. [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8248.26s)]
*  But yeah, accesses journalism has always been a problem. [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8252.980000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so you mentioned they might slow roll some hard stories. [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8257.38s)]
*  So in this era, it's easy to kind of figure out what a hard story might be, something [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8261.98s)]
*  critical of Trump, right? [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8265.58s)]
*  But what can you give us outside of Trump, minus Trump, examples of what might be hard [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8267.259999999998s)]
*  stories where they'd go, this is gonna cause some issues for us. [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8273.46s)]
*  It's hard to say because I haven't worked in a newsroom in a while that, I mean, I remember [[02:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8279.900000000001s)]
*  when I worked at Politico, for example, and I was covering Joe Biden. [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8288.62s)]
*  And I broke the story about Hunter Biden and the gun and really the thing that got him [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8293.140000000001s)]
*  indicted. [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8297.460000000001s)]
*  That took a very long time to get that published. [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8298.460000000001s)]
*  I got the feeling that it was being slow rolled. [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8301.300000000001s)]
*  It was at the beginning of the administration. [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8303.060000000001s)]
*  A lot of my colleagues didn't like it. [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8304.5s)]
*  I mean, newsrooms are political on both sides. [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8306.980000000001s)]
*  And I've never been one to pick a side based on the politics or who's in power, who's not. [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8309.86s)]
*  I don't like groupthink. [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8316.18s)]
*  And I tend to gravitate towards the stories that are outside of the groupthink or [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8317.86s)]
*  maybe others are a little afraid to touch. [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8325.060000000001s)]
*  But I've seen it on both sides. [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8328.980000000001s)]
*  Now, I was only at PUC for I think like a month or two into this Trump administration. [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8331.86s)]
*  But I never felt that they tried to stop me from reporting anything really. [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8336.9s)]
*  I was pretty tough on the Trump campaign. [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8343.86s)]
*  Although I was honest, I was one of the few reporters that was saying they're winning. [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8347.34s)]
*  People hated that. [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8351.66s)]
*  And people hated when he reported that. [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8352.66s)]
*  But it was true. [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8356.3s)]
*  I was like, this is what's happening. [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8357.3s)]
*  Even on Reddit, people are like, what's wrong with this woman? [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8360.54s)]
*  We hate her. [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8363.62s)]
*  And then guys, it's an inconvenient truth. [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8364.14s)]
*  But the Trump team also hated me because I was talking about how they were making money [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8369.86s)]
*  and the drama behind the scenes and the concerns and the messy ground game. [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8373.1s)]
*  I mean, I think report and then let the pieces fall where they could fall, right? [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8378.18s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you kind of sound like a reporter where you're supposed to accurately report. [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8384.14s)]
*  These are the problems that they're having, but they are winning and they were winning. [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8389.300000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they did win. [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8393.54s)]
*  Believe me, I know. [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8394.74s)]
*  We took tremendous heat for saying he's winning. [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8395.74s)]
*  The polling is clear. [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8399.98s)]
*  Certainly in the beginning, in the middle of certainly when Biden was in the race, it [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8402.7s)]
*  wasn't even close, right? [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8405.380000000001s)]
*  And so, but people often don't wanna hear the truth. [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8407.34s)]
*  Okay, one more thing about legacy media before we move to the files. [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8410.58s)]
*  So from my taste, they don't cover money in politics almost at all, right? [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8415.06s)]
*  And I don't get it. [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8424.779999999999s)]
*  I mean, I think I do, but from a news perspective, I don't get it. [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8425.779999999999s)]
*  Because 95% of the time, the person with more money wins the race. [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8430.779999999999s)]
*  And I wouldn't report that like, it's a wonderful thing. [[02:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8434.42s)]
*  This person is leading the race cuz they've raised more money. [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8436.779999999999s)]
*  I would wonder, well, yeah, then who do they owe, right? [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8439.699999999999s)]
*  But that part of the story never, ever, ever gets told. [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8442.46s)]
*  And then in the legislation, my God, the lobbyists have massive, massive influence. [[02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8445.699999999999s)]
*  And they pretty much tell the politicians what to do. [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8451.699999999999s)]
*  But whenever I read legacy media, that's not the story I see. [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8454.08s)]
*  The story I see is about how they're having a debate about policy or ideology. [[02:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8458.38s)]
*  So what do you make of that? [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8463.82s)]
*  Why do you think that that is not as emphasized in legacy media? [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8465.539999999999s)]
*  Okay, so the sources to the stories, a lot of them, [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8469.539999999999s)]
*  are the consultants around these politicians, right? [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8473.1s)]
*  The lobbyists, for example. [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8477.18s)]
*  And if you start writing about their money, you will be cut off. [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8478.939999999999s)]
*  That's who really cuts you off. [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8484.859999999999s)]
*  That's who really takes away your access. [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8486.9s)]
*  Those are the people who really make it difficult for you. [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8489.66s)]
*  If you mention, they have pass-through accounts that are making millions of [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8492.5s)]
*  $100 are coming in there from a super PAC. [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8496.42s)]
*  Or you talk about who's donating to their PACs or this or that. [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8498.98s)]
*  I mean, Ken Vogel at the New York Times is a great reporter. [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8503.9s)]
*  He's really on this. [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8507.099999999999s)]
*  He really has covered money and influence in politics for a really long time. [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8508.9s)]
*  But a lot of journalists, especially beat reporters, [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8513.82s)]
*  they fall into the trap of not wanting to cover their sources. [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8517.099999999999s)]
*  Because their sources benefit from this kind of big money, [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8521.54s)]
*  PAC money, from lobbying money. [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8526.22s)]
*  They benefit from all that. [[02:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8529.74s)]
*  It's a swamp. [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8530.74s)]
*  The swamp feeds itself and the journalists are part of it too. [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8531.82s)]
*  Yeah, that's a great answer. [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8535.18s)]
*  There's a couple of things in there that I hadn't considered. [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8537.26s)]
*  Since I'm not in that world, the power of the consultants is something I read about [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8540.98s)]
*  but didn't experience in the way that you describe. [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8545.62s)]
*  It's like a mafia. [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8547.98s)]
*  It really is. [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8549.58s)]
*  It's not a mafia. [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8550.82s)]
*  People don't die because of it. [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8551.66s)]
*  But their careers can be ended in a lot of ways, right? [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8552.779999999999s)]
*  I think there's a real power of the consultancy class. [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8556.14s)]
*  But they're also blamed. [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8560.3s)]
*  They're always the first to be blamed too when a candidate loses. [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8561.86s)]
*  I mean, there's a circular firing squad happening right now within the Biden world [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8565.14s)]
*  and the Harris world. [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8570.02s)]
*  How can you spend over a billion dollars and still lose, right? [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8571.38s)]
*  Who made money? [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8574.619999999999s)]
*  Which PAC made all this money? [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8575.9s)]
*  Who cleaned up at the end? [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8577.539999999999s)]
*  There's a lot of anger at that super PAC. [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8579.660000000002s)]
*  I'm blanking on the name of it right now. [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8582.140000000001s)]
*  But it was run by Biden's- [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8583.660000000002s)]
*  Yes, Future Forward. [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8585.78s)]
*  It was run by Biden's former communications director, Anita Dunn. [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8586.78s)]
*  Where did all that money go? [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8591.140000000001s)]
*  That's what everyone always says, right? [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8592.78s)]
*  But you know that someone walked away a lot richer. [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8594.42s)]
*  No. [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8597.02s)]
*  And the candidate loses. [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8598.300000000001s)]
*  And that makes people angry because you can walk away rich as long as your candidate wins. [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8599.300000000001s)]
*  Because once you're in power, then everyone gets wealthy through the influence game. [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8604.300000000001s)]
*  Access to power. [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8607.900000000001s)]
*  Again. [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8608.98s)]
*  That's so sick. [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8609.98s)]
*  It's all about getting that, it's all about that access game. [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8610.98s)]
*  And it works for the journalists too. [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8616.14s)]
*  I mean, that's part of the reason why I don't live in Washington. [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8617.9s)]
*  I just think that there's something about it. [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8620.779999999999s)]
*  It rubs off on you. [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8622.619999999999s)]
*  I go there frequently, but for work to do reporting, to meet with sources. [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8623.94s)]
*  But at the end of the day, I think you got to get out of there, take a shower, and rearrange [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8628.38s)]
*  your look and realize this is not normal. [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8633.38s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, no, no. [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8636.619999999999s)]
*  That is a really interesting way of framing it. [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8638.78s)]
*  I think that's right. [[02:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8642.42s)]
*  I think there was, and if you noticed, by the way, for those of you at home, how many [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8643.42s)]
*  stories have been written where they named the consultants that kept a lot of money and [[02:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8648.300000000001s)]
*  got super rich off this campaign, even though Kamala Harris lost? [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8653.060000000001s)]
*  I haven't seen any. [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8657.58s)]
*  I don't know if there's been one or two, but I've seen- [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8658.66s)]
*  It's rare. [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8660.94s)]
*  It's rare. [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8661.94s)]
*  You just see it from time to time. [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8662.94s)]
*  My former colleague, Teddy Schleifer, at the New York Times, he's written about it. [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8665.78s)]
*  I've written about it as well, particularly after the campaign when people realized that [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8670.14s)]
*  Kamala Harris was in debt after all of that. [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8674.5s)]
*  I mean, people were furious. [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8676.78s)]
*  Got tons of phone calls. [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8679.699999999999s)]
*  But yeah, a lot of people, they're not really willing to sell out their sources. [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8682.1s)]
*  And believe me, if someone's a former communications director and they're working a super bag, [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8686.58s)]
*  they know how to work journalists to make sure their names are not in the story. [[02:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8690.5s)]
*  Yeah, that's another huge part of it. [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8694.3s)]
*  Once you're a source, you get more protected. [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8696.34s)]
*  Okay, so now let's, speaking of protected and not protected, let's go to Jeffrey Epstein. [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8698.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8703.98s)]
*  So you've covered this for a while. [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8704.98s)]
*  So first fun question, what do you think? [[02:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8707.34s)]
*  Are the files, A, relevant when we finally see them? [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8710.38s)]
*  Is there something real in the files? [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8714.66s)]
*  Of course you're guessing it's your estimation based on covering it. [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8717.3s)]
*  And B, are we ever going to see the files? [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8720.94s)]
*  Okay, so there's no John Doe list. [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8724.78s)]
*  I'm so tired of hearing people say the list, okay? [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8728.42s)]
*  There is no list. [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8731.380000000001s)]
*  Everybody needs to get over that, there is no list. [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8733.5s)]
*  Now, I've gone through almost all the public files. [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8735.74s)]
*  And those are the files that Pam Bondi put out. [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8739.1s)]
*  There was nothing new. [[02:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8741.380000000001s)]
*  It was a complete joke when she did that. [[02:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8742.380000000001s)]
*  And she used these right leaning influencers as props in front of the White House with [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8744.58s)]
*  her classified binder. [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8749.18s)]
*  Nothing in there was classified. [[02:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8750.54s)]
*  It was Virginia, Juffre, Roberts, all of those were court documents basically. [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8752.02s)]
*  She's a very good friend of mine. [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8757.900000000001s)]
*  I worked on the podcast with her, Broken, Jeffrey Epstein. [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8758.900000000001s)]
*  Definitely check it out. [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8762.7s)]
*  We traveled all over and we found witnesses to corroborate her case and the case of so [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8763.7s)]
*  many others. [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8767.26s)]
*  And they ended up using it actually to prosecute Glaine Maxwell. [[02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8768.26s)]
*  The only person by the way who is behind bars right now, despite the fact that this is like [[02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8772.94s)]
*  the largest sex trafficking operation maybe in our modern time right now. [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8777.18s)]
*  It's unclear, at least in America. [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8783.1s)]
*  But the point is that no one has paid the price for this. [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8784.82s)]
*  And there's absolutely, absolutely evidence that hasn't been released. [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8789.28s)]
*  There's photographs, I'm sure. [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8795.7s)]
*  There are videos. [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8798.1s)]
*  The girls told me that they basically filmed everything. [[02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8799.1s)]
*  There were videos of everything. [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8803.380000000001s)]
*  They were constantly collecting compromise. [[02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8804.380000000001s)]
*  So I'm sure the FBI has that. [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8806.84s)]
*  Problem is there are minors involved in this. [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8808.8s)]
*  And so I could see why they don't want to make that footage, that data public. [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8812.4s)]
*  Because there are a lot of women's names. [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8819.44s)]
*  The names of children, now women. [[02:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8823.36s)]
*  There are graphic photos. [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8826.32s)]
*  I remember Virginia telling me that she was brought into the FBI and they saw a picture [[02:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8828.04s)]
*  of her being raped by a very prominent person. [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8833.36s)]
*  I don't want to mention it right now because I feel uncomfortable speaking about her and [[02:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8839.880000000001s)]
*  her experience in her death. [[02:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8844.08s)]
*  Something that she didn't talk about publicly. [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8845.52s)]
*  But yeah, they have photographic evidence. [[02:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8848.08s)]
*  That's probably what they're withholding. [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8852.02s)]
*  And the videos, that footage, they could certainly try to prosecute these people. [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8855.52s)]
*  Yeah, so a couple of things about that. [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8861.279999999999s)]
*  I don't know what's stopping them. [[02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8862.279999999999s)]
*  I mean, the names that I've heard, I can understand why they're not prosecuting them. [[02:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8863.279999999999s)]
*  They're very powerful people. [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8869.16s)]
*  Yeah, so well, a word you use might explain it. [[02:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8870.92s)]
*  You use the word compromise. [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8875.24s)]
*  And that's having compromising information about a public official that you could then [[02:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8877.279999999999s)]
*  use presumably to blackmail them and influence them. [[02:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8882.72s)]
*  And so who was collecting this as compromise? [[02:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8886.26s)]
*  Epstein was, he was absolutely collecting it. [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8891.34s)]
*  Just Epstein or do we think there was someone behind Epstein? [[02:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8894.62s)]
*  You think Massad? [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8898.460000000001s)]
*  Is that what you're thinking? [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8901.82s)]
*  I know that he was helping the CIA. [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8904.66s)]
*  I remember seeing that in some of the data in some of the documents that he had offered [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8906.86s)]
*  some information to CIA. [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8912.28s)]
*  I don't know exactly what it was, but it was factored into his sweetheart deal. [[02:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8914.02s)]
*  He did travel a lot. [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8917.42s)]
*  He was friends with Ehud Barak. [[02:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8920.3s)]
*  He was constantly among powerful people. [[02:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8922.58s)]
*  He picked up things and he passed it along and that was a factor in his sweetheart deal. [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8928.779999999999s)]
*  Do I think he also did that with other intelligence agencies? [[02:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8932.82s)]
*  I don't think Epstein was a particularly upstanding gentleman. [[02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8936.699999999999s)]
*  So I think it's possible. [[02:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8940.74s)]
*  I just don't have any, I've never had any data to suggest that or know anything about [[02:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8943.66s)]
*  that. [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8950.38s)]
*  But I know that the people he spent time with certainly had those contacts. [[02:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8951.38s)]
*  He knew people at the highest levels of many governments and I could see them seeing him [[02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8957.14s)]
*  as being a useful person. [[02:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8962.22s)]
*  I mean, it's really unclear to me how a guy who was a high school math teacher suddenly [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8963.539999999999s)]
*  becomes a billionaire, right? [[02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8967.86s)]
*  He was a high school math teacher. [[02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8970.34s)]
*  He was a high school math teacher. [[02:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8972.539999999999s)]
*  No, I know that's what's funny. [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8974.019999999999s)]
*  I mean- Lex Wexner is the only reason he has billions of dollars. [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8975.58s)]
*  It's crazy. [[02:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8980.06s)]
*  I mean, he was teaching adult and trying to pick up students. [[02:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8981.06s)]
*  They had to get rid of them. [[02:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8984.34s)]
*  Yeah, well that sounds right. [[02:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8986.38s)]
*  Bill Barr's father actually was like, you're done, you're out. [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8987.38s)]
*  So hold on, I wanna talk about that more. [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8990.099999999999s)]
*  So first for the audience, Ehud Barak's former Prime Minister of Israel and the person who [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8992.38s)]
*  gave Epstein the sweetheart deal back in I think, 2008 and down in Miami was Acosta, [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=8997.660000000002s)]
*  who then later became Trump's labor secretary in his first term. [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9003.34s)]
*  And he was a- And his lawyer was Ken Starr. [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9007.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9009.54s)]
*  Epstein's lawyer was Ken Starr, who you all know. [[02:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9010.54s)]
*  Yeah, that is so curious, right? [[02:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9013.26s)]
*  So tell- Well, he hired Republicans and Democrats when he did this. [[02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9016.62s)]
*  He made sure to have the full gambit. [[02:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9020.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9023.62s)]
*  So that he could work every angle. [[02:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9024.62s)]
*  So tell us about Lex Wexler. [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9026.18s)]
*  You said he picked him up and turned him into a billionaire. [[02:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9028.460000000001s)]
*  Who is he? [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9031.380000000001s)]
*  Les Wexner is the billionaire- Excuse me, yeah. [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9034.300000000001s)]
*  The billionaire behind Victoria's Secret. [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9037.9s)]
*  He created Victoria's Secret. [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9042.62s)]
*  And now he's disgraced. [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9045.78s)]
*  I believe the board took it away from him. [[02:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9048.06s)]
*  But I mean, he's obviously someone that Epstein would be attracted to. [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9050.460000000001s)]
*  The man who creates Victoria's Secret Angels, right? [[02:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9055.779999999999s)]
*  He had access to the runway show, the lifestyle. [[02:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9059.34s)]
*  And they became very good friends. [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9063.74s)]
*  In fact, Jeffrey Epstein helped introduce Les to his wife, Abigail. [[02:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9065.98s)]
*  And it's very weird because most people say that Les was not exactly a party [[02:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9072.099999999999s)]
*  animal. [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9075.9s)]
*  He wasn't like Jeffrey who liked to be out and about. [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9076.38s)]
*  But they were very close to the point where they had houses right next to each [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9079.699999999999s)]
*  other. [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9083.42s)]
*  And there was a tunnel that connected the two houses on the upper east side. [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9084.14s)]
*  These are the largest mansions in. [[02:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9087.58s)]
*  And Epstein bought Les's apartment for [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9089.779999999999s)]
*  $20 million markedly under-rate, like underpriced. [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9093.699999999999s)]
*  Their relationship was very weird to the point where some people suggested that [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9097.82s)]
*  they might be lovers, that they were that close. [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9101.259999999998s)]
*  Wow. [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9104.099999999999s)]
*  Well, the underground tunnel connecting their houses, [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9104.699999999999s)]
*  especially knowing Epstein, that reeks of creepy. [[02:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9108.220000000001s)]
*  So, but if Les wasn't into that lifestyle, [[02:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9112.78s)]
*  but somebody's collecting comprimont, [[02:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9118.300000000001s)]
*  maybe connects to the people who are collecting the comprimont. [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9123.58s)]
*  We don't know, I don't know, but it's impossible not to ask questions. [[02:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9128.94s)]
*  Because there's the biggest bucket of comprimont the world has ever seen. [[02:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9132.820000000002s)]
*  And the idea that the intelligence agencies would not be interested in that [[02:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9139.380000000001s)]
*  is preposterous. [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9144.1s)]
*  And then he shows up dead in a maximum security prison in America with [[02:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9145.58s)]
*  the video camera not working in the hallway and the guards on break and [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9150.74s)]
*  his roommate removed. [[02:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9153.980000000001s)]
*  All right, so let me ask you that. [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9155.34s)]
*  I'm with you though, I think it's very suspicious. [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9156.78s)]
*  I'm not a big, I'm not very conspiratorial. [[02:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9158.980000000001s)]
*  I'm really not. [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9161.060000000001s)]
*  I try to live in the fact world, but [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9161.86s)]
*  there are a lot of coincidences in that story. [[02:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9164.62s)]
*  I mean, and there was the cop from Long Island inside of the, [[02:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9168.220000000001s)]
*  who people say, I mean, CBS News suggested he could have been paid off privately. [[02:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9173.82s)]
*  You know, that's to do it. [[02:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9180.54s)]
*  I don't know as much about that one. [[02:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9182.300000000001s)]
*  So look, for just real quick, so you know, Tara, [[02:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9183.86s)]
*  I said live on the air when we found out that he got killed. [[02:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9187.94s)]
*  I said if the camera in the hallway is working, then it was a suicide. [[02:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9191.98s)]
*  If the camera in the hallway was not working, then he was killed. [[02:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9197.02s)]
*  And we found out later the camera isn't working. [[02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9201.34s)]
*  I'm like, there are no coincidences that large. [[02:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9204.3s)]
*  Like the most valuable prisoner- [[02:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9207.26s)]
*  He bragged that he was Trump's boy, that Trump was his boy and [[02:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9209.74s)]
*  that he would never prosecute him. [[02:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9213.42s)]
*  He did that just years before he was arrested. [[02:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9214.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and then all of a sudden he's so despondent that he's going to kill himself [[02:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9218.1s)]
*  when he thinks Trump's never going to prosecute him. [[02:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9221.62s)]
*  And by the way, he's a very good reason for believing that they were friends for [[02:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9223.900000000001s)]
*  a long time. [[02:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9226.380000000001s)]
*  And when Ghislaine Maxwell was arrested and they asked Trump about it, [[02:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9227.34s)]
*  he said twice that she's a very fine person. [[02:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9230.66s)]
*  So again, he knows her. [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9233.26s)]
*  I mean, that is an unbelievable thing to say about the top groomer of our lifetimes. [[02:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9234.900000000001s)]
*  For the president to say that, it's just stunning. [[02:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9241.5s)]
*  But tell me more about the cop. [[02:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9243.7s)]
*  I'm happy you called her a groomer, by the way, because that is what she was. [[02:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9244.82s)]
*  And she's often inappropriately and [[02:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9248.14s)]
*  disrespectfully to these girls called a madam. [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9250.66s)]
*  And it's like, no, you cannot be a madam to a 14-year-old. [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9254.82s)]
*  They're children. [[02:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9258.3s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I mean, textbook rumor, textbook. [[02:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9259.5s)]
*  Yeah, horrible what she did. [[02:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9262.9s)]
*  Yeah, and not a fine person, a terrible person, right? [[02:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9264.46s)]
*  So okay, so you were saying about the Long Island detective. [[02:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9267.9s)]
*  Tell me more about that. [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9270.78s)]
*  Well, there's a cop in Long Island. [[02:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9272.539999999999s)]
*  And I remember that 60 Minutes did a very long piece about what you talked about. [[02:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9274.14s)]
*  The fact that he would have to have hung himself with the sheets and [[02:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9278.58s)]
*  the guards were asleep and the cameras off. [[02:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9284.34s)]
*  And the way that these, what happens inside of prisons. [[02:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9290.42s)]
*  Well, first of all, pedophiles don't do well in prison, by the way. [[02:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9294.34s)]
*  They're often the first to be killed. [[02:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9296.94s)]
*  Even for criminals who commit murder and do other heinous acts, [[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9300.18s)]
*  the lowest of low in a prison is a pedophile. [[02:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9304.38s)]
*  And so they are often targeted. [[02:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9307.62s)]
*  But there's a possibility, they suggested that this police officer [[02:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9309.74s)]
*  from Long Island could have been paid off by someone to do this. [[02:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9315.9s)]
*  Now, he wouldn't obviously get the money directly, but [[02:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9320.34s)]
*  it would be go to his family. [[02:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9322.7s)]
*  So I always thought, check out around his neighborhood and see if they all of a sudden [[02:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9324.14s)]
*  have new cars or they're updating their houses or they're buying a boat. [[02:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9327.460000000001s)]
*  But that's sort of how it's done. [[02:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9331.26s)]
*  It's not like this idea that Clintons are clawing into the jailhouse. [[02:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9333.34s)]
*  It's like they had El Chapo in there. [[02:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9342.42s)]
*  I mean, it's crazy to think about the level. [[02:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9344.38s)]
*  This prison has held some of the most important detainees we've ever really had. [[02:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9350.42s)]
*  And I just think- [[02:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9357.06s)]
*  Yeah, there's one thing- [[02:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9358.34s)]
*  It's a coincidence. [[02:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9359.859999999999s)]
*  Yeah, Tara, in my opinion, there's one thing that's just inarguable. [[02:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9361.42s)]
*  There is no force on Earth that can kill someone inside a maximum security prison [[02:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9365.66s)]
*  in America and not have either the Democrats or the Republicans turn them in. [[02:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9370.019999999999s)]
*  And that's one of the- [[02:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9375.779999999999s)]
*  It wasn't a maximum security prison and it did have its flaws. [[02:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9376.5s)]
*  I do remember that the New York Post pointed out that this prison wasn't a great one. [[02:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9379.42s)]
*  But still, you have a very high profile prisoner in there. [[02:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9384.02s)]
*  Yeah, and so I hear you on that and it's a good clarification and [[02:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9388.82s)]
*  correction that it wasn't maximum security. [[02:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9393.22s)]
*  By the way, it should have been a maximum security. [[02:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9394.58s)]
*  Right. [[02:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9396.38s)]
*  Right, especially given what happened. [[02:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9397.619999999999s)]
*  But still, having that person killed inside a prison and [[02:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9400.02s)]
*  then neither side outs who did it, it's gotta be an intelligence agency. [[02:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9404.46s)]
*  There's no other force on Earth that could do that [[02:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9408.74s)]
*  other than either CIA or Mossad or both. [[02:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9411.98s)]
*  I mean, I suppose it could be a different intelligence agency. [[02:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9416.14s)]
*  You pay someone to do the inside job, or you're right, or someone- [[02:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9419.74s)]
*  But why wouldn't they release the files then if it's some random- [[02:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9423.42s)]
*  No, who killed Epstein? [[02:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9428.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9429.939999999999s)]
*  I think there's just, [[02:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9431.46s)]
*  they're just really, really powerful people, I think, that are involved. [[02:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9435.38s)]
*  Yeah, well, there you go. [[02:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9438.14s)]
*  And I think they're on both sides, because even the way he handled the first case [[02:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9439.740000000002s)]
*  against him, which was somehow brought down to prostitution of a child, [[02:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9444.18s)]
*  of a 14-year-old, as if you can solicit a 14-year-old for prostitution. [[02:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9448.820000000002s)]
*  That's what his first charge was back in, it was 2001 or 2000, yeah. [[02:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9454.26s)]
*  Or no, no, it was 2008, excuse me. [[02:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9461.140000000001s)]
*  2008, I think. [[02:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9462.66s)]
*  Yeah, exactly, 2008. [[02:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9464.1s)]
*  And first of all, that's an absurd charge. [[02:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9465.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9468.26s)]
*  A 14-year-old can't be a prostitute, but they worked every political angle they [[02:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9469.22s)]
*  could possibly work. [[02:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9474.019999999999s)]
*  They hired the lawyers when they had to deal with at the county level, [[02:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9475.22s)]
*  the Democrats, they hired the top Democratic lawyers they could possibly find. [[02:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9478.98s)]
*  When they had to go to and deal with Acosta, they hired all the top Republican [[02:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9483.699999999999s)]
*  lawyers they could find. [[02:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9488.18s)]
*  They worked it all the way up to the AG when George W Bush was president. [[02:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9489.779999999999s)]
*  So it was like, he had the money to buy everyone. [[02:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9493.74s)]
*  Everyone was bought. [[02:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9498.34s)]
*  Yeah, so one last thing about that. [[02:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9500.02s)]
*  So look, I get that if you've got the victims names or the victims in the videos or [[02:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9503.22s)]
*  the pictures, that's uncomfortable, etc. [[02:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9511.7s)]
*  First of all, redacting doesn't take 10 years. [[02:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9514.18s)]
*  It doesn't take two years, it doesn't take one year, it doesn't take six months. [[02:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9517.78s)]
*  Right. [[02:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9521.06s)]
*  I could redact that document for you in a week, okay? [[02:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9521.78s)]
*  Or I don't care if you have a room full of documents. [[02:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9526.1s)]
*  Trust me, we can redact it in a couple of weeks, okay? [[02:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9528.58s)]
*  But at a bare minimum, is there even an excuse for not releasing the names of the clients? [[02:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9532.26s)]
*  I mean, we know who they were, and we know that they were with underage girls. [[02:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9540.34s)]
*  So what's the reason not to release the names? [[02:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9545.220000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9549.86s)]
*  I think maybe I hope that it is to protect the women. [[02:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9550.58s)]
*  I mean, some of them, this is traumatic to have information to have out there without [[02:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9559.94s)]
*  your consent. [[02:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9565.94s)]
*  I mean, a lot of women don't talk about sexual abuse or the violence committed against them [[02:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9566.66s)]
*  because it's re-traumatizing. [[02:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9571.7s)]
*  But Tara, we already know that they got traumatized, and we already know, unfortunately, [[02:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9573.86s)]
*  a lot of the women's names. [[02:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9579.14s)]
*  But that doesn't mean that they want all the details of it out there. [[02:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9579.859999999999s)]
*  No, no, but it doesn't have to be details. [[02:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9582.34s)]
*  It could just be the names. [[02:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9583.859999999999s)]
*  And I don't see how that further traumatizes anyone, [[02:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9585.22s)]
*  because it's not the names of the victims, it's the names of the clients. [[02:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9588.099999999999s)]
*  It's very complicated. [[02:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9591.46s)]
*  I mean, it took me a really long time to earn the trust of the victims, the survivors. [[02:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9592.66s)]
*  But a lot of them still, they don't wanna talk about it. [[02:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9598.82s)]
*  There's been a number of suicides, it's not just Virginia Joufray. [[02:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9602.82s)]
*  It's really hard psychologically, what they've been through. [[02:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9605.86s)]
*  And I don't know, listen, I don't know that the government has decided that they wanna [[02:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9611.94s)]
*  think about the psychological impact on these young women. [[02:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9617.060000000001s)]
*  But I do think that if you got a phone call from the FBI and they said, [[02:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9619.94s)]
*  hey, we're gonna release the details around your assault and the person who did it. [[02:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9624.5s)]
*  And this is going to cause a news cycle. [[02:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9629.78s)]
*  And this is going to cause reporters to call you or this or that. [[02:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9632.34s)]
*  It's really, it's really, really hard. [[02:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9637.62s)]
*  Yeah, I hear you. [[02:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9642.1s)]
*  There's a reason they go by Jane Doe. [[02:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9642.74s)]
*  I know, usually Jane Doe's come forward and they say I'm the Jane Doe, [[02:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9644.58s)]
*  and I'm going after John Doe, right? [[02:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9649.14s)]
*  But when the details of their case has come out without their permission, [[02:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9651.7s)]
*  that's when it gets difficult, even when they are Jane Doe's. [[02:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9656.18s)]
*  Yeah, listen, that is definitely true of the women. [[02:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9660.18s)]
*  And I can understand why they would be re-traumatized if you got into the details [[02:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9664.1s)]
*  or their names, their identities, the acts, etc. [[02:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9668.42s)]
*  But I'm not buying that the US government is so concerned about re-traumatizing the victims, [[02:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9671.220000000001s)]
*  that that is why they're hiding the names of the guilty. [[02:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9678.9s)]
*  I think they're hiding the names of the guilty because they [[02:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9683.300000000001s)]
*  care more about the clients that did these terrible things than they care about the women [[02:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9686.74s)]
*  who suffered from it. [[02:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9692.58s)]
*  Listen, you may be right, and I'm not trying to cover for the US government, [[02:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9695.86s)]
*  but I see that side of the coin. [[02:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9699.78s)]
*  But I think that what they should do rather than release the names is actually [[02:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9702.58s)]
*  stand up a trial and actually indict these people, make them pay for the crimes rather [[02:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9707.380000000001s)]
*  than just shame them publicly and then they can deny it. [[02:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9714.02s)]
*  They actually put together a case, prosecute them, like you did to Glenn Maxwell. [[02:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9717.060000000001s)]
*  Isn't that amazing that they're not prosecuting these known pedophiles? [[02:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9722.1s)]
*  They know that they did it, they literally have them on tape and they're saying, golly gee, [[02:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9727.54s)]
*  we just can't. [[02:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9734.18s)]
*  No, the American government, however they're compromised, whether it's CIA or anything else, [[02:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9735.54s)]
*  is definitely compromised in this case. [[02:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9741.22s)]
*  There is no other logical explanation for why not to prosecute pedophiles when you have them on tape [[02:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9745.3s)]
*  as pedophiles. [[02:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9752.58s)]
*  It's just not, no, they're protecting those people for whatever reason. [[02:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9754.42s)]
*  Yeah, I agree, and I have to say that I have never seen the tapes, to be clear. [[02:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9760.66s)]
*  I just know from the girls that they believe everything was taped. [[02:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9764.82s)]
*  Yeah, that's cuz it was taped because it was compromised. [[02:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9769.859999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9772.5s)]
*  But so anyways, it's super interesting. [[02:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9773.939999999999s)]
*  I love that we had this conversation. [[02:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9776.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9778.26s)]
*  To me, everybody can draw different conclusions. [[02:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9779.22s)]
*  The conclusions that I draw have become even more firm. [[02:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9783.22s)]
*  I would be shocked, shocked if it wasn't an intelligence agency. [[02:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9787.539999999999s)]
*  I mean, theoretically, I guess it could be the British. [[02:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9792.34s)]
*  They don't seem as likely, but they had Prince Andrew, right? [[02:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9794.66s)]
*  But it's gotta be an intelligence agency. [[02:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9797.3s)]
*  No one else could kill someone in a US president like that and have the American government not [[02:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9799.619999999999s)]
*  object and have the American government not prosecute any of the guilty that are on tape. [[02:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9804.179999999998s)]
*  It's just not conceivable. [[02:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9811.06s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, he was a secretive guy. [[02:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9813.38s)]
*  I did another podcast on Robert Maxwell, [[02:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9815.539999999999s)]
*  Ghislaine Maxwell's father, who was also assumed to be a part of Mossad. [[02:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9818.259999999998s)]
*  He died mysteriously falling off his yacht. [[02:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9823.779999999999s)]
*  No, he did. [[02:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9826.58s)]
*  He, yeah, and the lady Ghislaine, he named after his daughter and he was said to be the person who [[02:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9827.46s)]
*  connected Ghislaine with Jeffrey Epstein. So it's never been proven, but he's believed to be the [[02:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9834.74s)]
*  matchmaker between the two. So maybe that is where connection was formed. He is a very interesting [[02:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9841.3s)]
*  character. It's called power the Maxwell's if you're looking to binge. It is truly a binge. [[02:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9848.26s)]
*  But you can understand where she came from. Daddy was a lot like Epstein. [[02:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9853.38s)]
*  Interesting. Yeah. Okay, things that make you go hmm. When you find out the biggest [[02:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9859.78s)]
*  groomer in American history, dad was a Mossad agent. And then the rest of it kind of falls [[02:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9865.38s)]
*  into place. All right, but you never know. You never know. But we just can give you the [[02:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9872.02s)]
*  facts we know, but not the facts we don't know. Okay, Tara's newsletter is called the red letter [[02:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9875.3s)]
*  on substack and her shows the Tara Palmieri show. Tara, I love that we did this. We should [[02:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9882.1s)]
*  do this more often. Yeah, thank you. Yeah, you can find me on YouTube too. Now that's where we [[02:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9886.9s)]
*  saw each other recently. Yep. And it's at Tara Palmieri. I just launched, but I appreciate you [[02:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9891.54s)]
*  having me on and I'm happy to come on whatever and I'd love to have you on my show too. [[02:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9896.66s)]
*  We're just getting started, but I'm so impressed with what you've built over the decades. I [[02:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9901.380000000001s)]
*  remember I was here. I was on your show about 10 years ago, I think. Or was it 2018 or 2019 [[02:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9906.34s)]
*  when Epstein was arrested and I came on and I talked to you about it. Yeah. From the closet. [[02:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9914.74s)]
*  Yeah. You always ask the right questions. Thank you. Thank you. And yeah, well, you know, [[02:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9921.22s)]
*  all of that has been brought a little bit out of the closet these days, the Epstein files, [[02:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9927.7s)]
*  but not completely. I'd still a lot in the closet. Anyways, yes, I'd love to do your show. [[02:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9931.14s)]
*  Everybody check out Tara's show, Tara Palmieri's show on YouTube. And again, [[02:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9935.7s)]
*  check out our sub stack red letter as well. All right, thanks Tara. Really appreciate it. [[02:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9940.740000000002s)]
*  Thank you. All right, guys, we'll see you tomorrow. [[02:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFGAdZ7Pbn4&t=9945.78s)]
