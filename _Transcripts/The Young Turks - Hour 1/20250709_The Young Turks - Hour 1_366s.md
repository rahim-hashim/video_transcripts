"MAGA influencers launched a movement to boycott the new Superman movie in response to director James Gunn proclaiming the story is inherently political.
Superman is set to be released on July 11. During the press tour leading up to that release, Gunn spoke to The Times of London last week in a wide-ranging conversation about his career and his newest film. It was in that profile piece that Gunn revealed the political undertones of his film."

# The Right Wing Is LOSING IT Over Superman Movie
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [July 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k)
*  Is Superman super woke? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=0.0s)]
*  James Gunn, the director of [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=2.16s)]
*  the latest reboot movie said, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=3.64s)]
*  quote, Superman is the story of [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=5.3s)]
*  America, an immigrant that came [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=6.94s)]
*  from other places and [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=8.68s)]
*  populated the country. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=9.8s)]
*  But for me, it is mostly a story [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=10.88s)]
*  that says basic human kindness is [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=12.68s)]
*  a value and is something we have [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=14.52s)]
*  lost. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=16.32s)]
*  Conservatives are upset because [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=19.42s)]
*  Superman is apparently going woke [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=21.44s)]
*  or maybe the character was [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=23.740000000000002s)]
*  inherently woke all along. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=25.52s)]
*  Well now because of what director [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=27.28s)]
*  James Gunn had to say about [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=29.1s)]
*  the character and the film, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=30.48s)]
*  conservatives are threatening to [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=31.900000000000002s)]
*  boycott the movie. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=33.54s)]
*  They don't love that Gunn said that [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=34.54s)]
*  the story is inherently political [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=36.32s)]
*  because the right loves to pretend [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=38.1s)]
*  that everything is not political. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=39.82s)]
*  The movie isn't even out yet, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=41.94s)]
*  by the way, or I think, is it out? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=43.5s)]
*  Or maybe it just came out. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=45.260000000000005s)]
*  But unless these specific members [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=46.980000000000004s)]
*  of the media are people who got to [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=48.58s)]
*  see advanced screenings of the [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=50.1s)]
*  thing, they don't really know what [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=51.540000000000006s)]
*  they're talking about. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=53.18000000000001s)]
*  So here's some of what was said [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=54.18000000000001s)]
*  about the movie on right wing [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=56.1s)]
*  social media. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=57.9s)]
*  So this first one says, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=60.019999999999996s)]
*  I'm going to skip seeing Superman [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=61.18s)]
*  now, director is an absolute moron [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=62.78s)]
*  to say this publicly the week [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=64.74s)]
*  before release. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=66.32s)]
*  America is desperate for [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=67.7s)]
*  apolitical entertainment and [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=69.17999999999999s)]
*  Hollywood is unable to deliver it. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=71.02s)]
*  And another one said, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=73.53999999999999s)]
*  the communist is always [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=74.86s)]
*  a communist first, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=76.3s)]
*  everything else is second. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=77.58s)]
*  It's why Hollywood will put out [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=79.66s)]
*  flop after flop and yet they still [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=81.25999999999999s)]
*  refuse to stop doing this. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=83.02s)]
*  If you're a movie director, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=84.86s)]
*  making a great one is not as [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=86.1s)]
*  important as the revolution. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=87.46s)]
*  I don't even know, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=89.14s)]
*  let's see, it's also crazy. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=90.05999999999999s)]
*  Okay, well, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=91.38s)]
*  James Gunn isn't exactly woke [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=92.38s)]
*  himself. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=94.69999999999999s)]
*  I doubt the left is trying to claim [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=95.94s)]
*  James Gunn. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=97.78s)]
*  He is a horrible person. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=98.5s)]
*  He is so horrible that I didn't [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=100.1s)]
*  even want to include his horrible [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=101.94s)]
*  tweets in this segment because I [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=103.89999999999999s)]
*  didn't want to read them out loud. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=105.61999999999999s)]
*  He did eventually get fired from [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=107.33999999999999s)]
*  Marvel for being terrible. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=109.13999999999999s)]
*  Again, not one time terrible but [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=110.69999999999999s)]
*  repeatedly terrible. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=112.78s)]
*  And it's honestly kind of shocking [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=114.41999999999999s)]
*  that DC is still involved with him. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=116.58000000000001s)]
*  I think he's pretty entrenched in [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=119.42s)]
*  the studio, but still, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=121.10000000000001s)]
*  it's probably time for [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=122.34s)]
*  them to separate from him. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=123.54s)]
*  Personally, I was not planning to [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=125.22s)]
*  watch this movie because I am [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=127.18s)]
*  tired of watching different [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=128.66s)]
*  versions of the same movie over and [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=130.12s)]
*  over and over again. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=131.98000000000002s)]
*  I am actively boycotting remakes [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=133.14000000000001s)]
*  and sequels, especially sequels [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=135.22s)]
*  that come out 20 years after [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=137.26s)]
*  the original. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=138.9s)]
*  But again, that is a personal [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=139.78s)]
*  thing, although I do invite you all [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=141.14000000000001s)]
*  to join me in my personal vendetta [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=143.10000000000002s)]
*  of bad movies. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=145.06s)]
*  But they're trying to monetize [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=147.42000000000002s)]
*  nostalgia and they're delivering [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=149.22s)]
*  slop in exchange for it and [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=151.46s)]
*  I resent them for it a little bit. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=153.10000000000002s)]
*  But they're not producing flops [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=155.38s)]
*  just because they can't not be [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=157.42000000000002s)]
*  communist. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=159.42000000000002s)]
*  They're going for money and grabs. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=160.58s)]
*  It has nothing to do with [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=161.94s)]
*  communism. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=162.94s)]
*  It's very strange how they always [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=163.46s)]
*  end up at communism. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=165.18s)]
*  The simplest explanation is usually [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=166.74s)]
*  the right one. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=168.54000000000002s)]
*  I don't know what communism has to [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=169.58s)]
*  do with any of this. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=171.02s)]
*  Also, James Gunn is the one he got [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=172.66s)]
*  rid of Henry Cavill. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=174.78s)]
*  He said no more Henry Cavill, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=176.33999999999997s)]
*  we're going to hire this other guy [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=177.94s)]
*  instead and I can't say I'm happy [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=179.78s)]
*  about that either. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=181.5s)]
*  The people want Henry Cavill and [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=183.1s)]
*  no one will just give us Henry [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=184.88s)]
*  Cavill, no hate to Liam Hemsworth [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=186.5s)]
*  or whoever this new Superman is. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=188.54s)]
*  But give the people what they want. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=191.5s)]
*  I saw the post and [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=193.85999999999999s)]
*  thought it was Henry Cavill, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=194.54s)]
*  honestly. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=195.78s)]
*  It's not. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=196.33999999999997s)]
*  It's just like see, it's always [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=196.89999999999998s)]
*  just like a lesser version of what [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=198.73999999999998s)]
*  we once had. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=200.78s)]
*  That's all that we get. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=201.78s)]
*  I missed the right that used to [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=202.82000000000002s)]
*  decry trigger warnings and [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=206.5s)]
*  hurt feelings. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=209.94s)]
*  And I missed the people that were [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=212.98000000000002s)]
*  just so tough that nothing could [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=215.10000000000002s)]
*  bother them or hurt them. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=217.34s)]
*  And Clay Travis is a complete and [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=219.06s)]
*  utter fraud and idiot. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=221.38s)]
*  And the reason why I say that is [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=223.3s)]
*  because there are no apolitical [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=225.46s)]
*  Hollywood movies and [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=227.94s)]
*  they never were. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=229.57999999999998s)]
*  The fact of the matter is when [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=231.54s)]
*  you're watching Top Gun, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=233.26s)]
*  what you're watching is propaganda [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=234.85999999999999s)]
*  for militarism. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=236.9s)]
*  That's political. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=238.29999999999998s)]
*  That's not a Top Gun is not [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=239.54s)]
*  apolitical. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=241.1s)]
*  They're propagandizing you into [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=242.22s)]
*  loving the military industrial [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=244.57999999999998s)]
*  complex, imperialism, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=246.94s)]
*  American hegemony. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=249.06s)]
*  It's literally propagandizing you. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=250.73999999999998s)]
*  So much of our TV and movies are [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=253.42s)]
*  very, have positive feelings about [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=255.73999999999998s)]
*  commercialism and consumerism and [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=258.5s)]
*  capitalism and spending and [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=261.06s)]
*  consumption and all of this stuff. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=263.18s)]
*  That's political. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=266.34s)]
*  It's not apolitical. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=267.53999999999996s)]
*  None of the media we consume is [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=268.82s)]
*  apolitical. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=271.21999999999997s)]
*  So not only is Clay Travis an [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=272.85999999999996s)]
*  idiot, he's a fraud and [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=274.85999999999996s)]
*  doesn't even know anything about [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=276.38s)]
*  the movies that he complains about. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=278.62s)]
*  I mean, they are kind of dumb, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=281.41999999999996s)]
*  right? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=283.06s)]
*  To say that anything is [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=283.58s)]
*  apolitical is a dumb take because [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=285.02s)]
*  anything can't, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=287.1s)]
*  it's all a matter of the lens, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=288.1s)]
*  right? It's what you take out of [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=289.62s)]
*  it. It's what you see whenever you [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=291.02s)]
*  consume any kind of art or media or [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=292.78000000000003s)]
*  whatever. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=294.62s)]
*  And the thing is, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=295.62s)]
*  you mentioned Top Gun. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=296.82s)]
*  Somebody actually, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=299.26s)]
*  there was another criticism. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=300.02s)]
*  I didn't include it in the story, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=301.3s)]
*  but there was somebody else who [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=302.42s)]
*  said, why is James Gunn trying to [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=303.74s)]
*  make this story political? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=305.38s)]
*  Why can't we just have something [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=307.06s)]
*  that's no politics involved, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=308.78s)]
*  like Top Gun, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=310.66s)]
*  the remake of Top Gun that came out. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=311.62s)]
*  It was just a good time. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=313.98s)]
*  And I was like, are you joking? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=315.02s)]
*  And it's true. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=317.94s)]
*  I mean, like- [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=318.82s)]
*  Do the Jason Bourne movies? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=320.06s)]
*  I can't watch You've Got Mail [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=321.3s)]
*  anymore because it's so creepy. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=322.78000000000003s)]
*  CIA agents know how to fight. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=325.38s)]
*  They speak eight different [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=329.34000000000003s)]
*  languages. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=330.54s)]

*  give me a freaking break. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=334.94s)]
*  If that's not CIA propaganda, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=337.38s)]
*  I don't know what is. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6iNnaTM0k&t=340.38s)]
