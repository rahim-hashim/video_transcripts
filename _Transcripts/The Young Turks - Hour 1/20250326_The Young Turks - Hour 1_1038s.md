Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

# RELEASED: What Exactly Was In The Yemen War Plans Signal Group Chat
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [March 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ)
*  Nobody's texting war plans. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=0.0s)]
*  I noticed this morning, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=2.88s)]
*  out came something that doesn't [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  look like war plans. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=6.72s)]
*  And as a matter of fact, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=8.52s)]
*  they even changed the title to [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=10.0s)]
*  attack plans because they know [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=11.96s)]
*  it's not war plans. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=13.9s)]
*  There's no units, no locations, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=15.26s)]
*  no routes, no flight paths, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=18.6s)]
*  no sources, no methods, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=21.5s)]
*  no classified information. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=23.98s)]
*  Secretary, how do you swear what [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=26.44s)]
*  you said with what your messages [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=28.16s)]
*  show? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=29.700000000000003s)]
*  Well, Defense Secretary Pete [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=32.64s)]
*  Hegseth was defiant yet again [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=34.56s)]
*  today as the press asked for [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=36.6s)]
*  him to weigh in on the revelations [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=38.400000000000006s)]
*  that were revealed by the Atlantic's [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=40.8s)]
*  Jeffrey Goldberg, who was [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=43.36s)]
*  accidentally included in a signal [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=45.400000000000006s)]
*  text message group of Trump [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=47.84s)]
*  administration officials who were [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=49.84s)]
*  discussing specifics in regard to [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  an attack on Houthi rebels in [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=55.36s)]
*  Yemen. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=57.7s)]
*  Now, the latest is Goldberg, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=58.92s)]
*  who has basically been dealing with [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=60.8s)]
*  attacks from Trump administration [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=62.9s)]
*  officials over his reporting on [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  this, has released some of these [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=66.88s)]
*  text messages, which seem to debunk [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=68.92s)]
*  some of what you heard Pete Hegseth [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=71.14s)]
*  say in that segment, right, Cenk? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=73.16s)]
*  Yeah, so I think that there's some [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=76.0s)]
*  really important things in here. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=77.8s)]
*  Their discussion of Israel was [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=80.52s)]
*  slightly interesting. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=82.0s)]
*  Their disagreements were [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=83.32s)]
*  interesting. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=84.47999999999999s)]
*  But what's absolutely clear is they [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=85.08s)]
*  totally and utterly needlessly [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=87.52s)]
*  lied, why not just admit it? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=89.75999999999999s)]
*  So we'll show you how they lied and [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=92.91999999999999s)]
*  we'll talk about what they should [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=94.16s)]
*  have done instead. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=95.52s)]
*  Exactly, so incredibly the Trump [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=96.08s)]
*  administration is also attempting [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=98.03999999999999s)]
*  to spin this as a win for [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=100.11999999999999s)]
*  the administration, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=101.39999999999999s)]
*  which is pretty incredible. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=102.74s)]
*  But I'm actually happy to report [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=104.96s)]
*  that I'm seeing a lot of big name [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=106.6s)]
*  Trump supporters on social media [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=108.24s)]
*  who ain't buying it. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=110.08s)]
*  And I commend them for not buying [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=111.7s)]
*  it because we shouldn't allow for [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=113.80000000000001s)]
*  our preferred politicians to just [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=116.0s)]
*  lie in our faces about a very [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=118.34s)]
*  obvious reality here. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=120.18s)]
*  So let's get into these screenshots [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=122.4s)]
*  because the screenshots show as [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=124.44000000000001s)]
*  suspected, National Security [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=126.2s)]
*  Advisor Michael Waltz was the [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=128.04000000000002s)]
*  person who added Jeffrey Goldberg [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=129.64000000000001s)]
*  to the group chat. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=131.68s)]
*  You can see it, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=133.24s)]
*  Michael Waltz added you to [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=134.28s)]
*  the group. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=136.12s)]
*  This is a screenshot that was [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=137.32s)]
*  shared by Jeffrey Goldberg. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=138.52s)]
*  So the first chunk of messages [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=139.84s)]
*  basically includes Pete Hegseth, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=141.64000000000001s)]
*  J.D. Vance and Waltz going back and [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=143.76s)]
*  forth about whether or not they [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=145.98000000000002s)]
*  should carry out strikes against [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=147.88s)]
*  the Houthis at all with Vance [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=149.9s)]
*  arguing no and Waltz and [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=151.6s)]
*  Hegseth saying yes. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=153.0s)]
*  We talked about that in more detail [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=154.96s)]
*  on yesterday's show. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=156.92000000000002s)]
*  Once they decided to go ahead with [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=158.24s)]
*  the strikes, Hegseth sent very [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=160.32s)]
*  specific updates on what [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=162.2s)]
*  the military was doing. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=163.76s)]
*  So let's take a quick look at that. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=165.88s)]
*  As you can see from these [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=167.56s)]
*  screenshots, these are very [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=168.84s)]
*  specific indications of what [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=170.56s)]
*  the military is doing against [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=172.36s)]
*  the Houthis in Yemen. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=174.28s)]
*  Hegseth writes team update time now [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=175.8s)]

*  a fist emoji, an American flag [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=238.32s)]
*  emoji and a fire emoji. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=240.64000000000001s)]
*  Really, showing the professionalism [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=242.52s)]
*  not only in using an unsecured app [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=246.12s)]
*  in communicating these attack [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=249.20000000000002s)]
*  plans, but also using the emojis in [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=251.96s)]
*  response to Hegseth's updates. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=255.28s)]
*  So the Umini Health Ministry [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=257.56s)]
*  reported that at least 53 people [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=259.12s)]
*  were killed in these strikes. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=260.88s)]
*  And later that day Hegseth told [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=262.6s)]
*  the group chat that attacks would [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=264.52000000000004s)]
*  be continuing. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=266.56s)]
*  So let's talk a little bit about [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=268.04s)]
*  the Trump administration's response [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=269.92s)]
*  to the latest revelations that [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=272.16s)]
*  broke today. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=273.92s)]
*  But before we do, I want to give [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=274.84000000000003s)]
*  you an opportunity to weigh in, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=276.12s)]
*  Cenk. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=277.2s)]
*  So look, this is a huge mistake. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=277.72s)]
*  And it's obviously, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=279.88s)]
*  they're calling it sensitive [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=280.92s)]
*  information and I understand that [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=282.40000000000003s)]
*  it obviously would normally be [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=284.24s)]
*  classified. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=286.12s)]
*  Yes, Trump could say it's no longer [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=287.4s)]
*  classified or we magically [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=289.64s)]
*  unclassified it earlier. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=291.4s)]
*  Sure, they can say that. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=293.36s)]
*  But we all know that normally this [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=295.03999999999996s)]
*  would be classified. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=296.4s)]
*  I mean, imagine if instead of [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=297.59999999999997s)]
*  Jeffrey Goldberg, they accidentally [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=298.96s)]
*  sent it to someone else, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=300.8s)]
*  a journalist or otherwise, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=302.0s)]
*  who made it public. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=303.59999999999997s)]
*  Then our pilots could have been [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=305.2s)]
*  shot down because then they would [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=306.64s)]
*  have known that they were coming. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=307.96s)]
*  It could have gotten people killed. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=309.44s)]
*  It's a super serious issue. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=311.08s)]
*  And you can say, hey, wow, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=313.48s)]
*  we made a mistake there and [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=315.16s)]
*  we're deeply sorry about that. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=316.68s)]
*  Thank God nothing went wrong, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=318.52000000000004s)]
*  at least for the pilots and [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=320.16s)]
*  our side, etc. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=321.64000000000004s)]
*  But here's what we're going to do [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=323.12s)]
*  to address it. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=324.48s)]
*  But they haven't done that. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=325.64000000000004s)]
*  They just keep doubling down on [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=326.76000000000005s)]
*  the lie after lie. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=328.40000000000003s)]
*  And interestingly, now some of [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=329.96000000000004s)]
*  the right wing hosts are turning on [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=331.32000000000005s)]
*  them and saying, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=332.88000000000005s)]
*  why are you guys lying? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=333.64000000000004s)]
*  Because this is obvious. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=335.16s)]
*  This is brazen. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=336.12s)]
*  So that to me is the bigger issue. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=337.24s)]
*  So remarkably, even after Jeffrey [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=340.12s)]
*  Goldberg released these screenshots [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=342.76s)]
*  of the exact messages he was able [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=345.88s)]
*  to read, the messages that he [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=348.48s)]
*  received containing specific [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=350.64s)]
*  details about military operations, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=352.88s)]
*  the Trump administration is [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=355.72s)]
*  claiming victory. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=357.88s)]
*  And look, to be fair, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=359.52000000000004s)]
*  the Trump administration has gotten [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=360.68s)]
*  away with doing this exact strategy [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=362.72s)]
*  in the past. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=364.76s)]
*  It's just not working this time [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=365.52000000000004s)]
*  because the intelligence is so [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=367.44s)]
*  overwhelming against them. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=369.0s)]
*  So Mike Waltz, for instance, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=370.47999999999996s)]
*  posted on X, no locations, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=372.12s)]
*  no sources and methods, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=373.76s)]
*  no war plans. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=375.28s)]
*  Foreign partners had already been [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=376.84s)]
*  notified that strikes were imminent. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=378.59999999999997s)]
*  Bottom line, President Trump is [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=380.79999999999995s)]
*  protecting America and our interests. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=382.23999999999995s)]
*  I mean, we just read you specifics [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=384.0s)]
*  in the messages a little while ago. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=385.91999999999996s)]
*  Obviously, he's not telling [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=388.44s)]
*  the truth here. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=389.84s)]
*  Vice President JD Vance piggybacks [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=390.47999999999996s)]
*  off of that. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=392.59999999999997s)]
*  It's very clear Goldberg oversold [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=393.35999999999996s)]
*  what he had. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=395.59999999999997s)]
*  Diddy, the Defense Department is [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=396.8s)]
*  hilariously trying to claim that [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=398.92s)]
*  the title of today's Atlantic piece [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=400.96000000000004s)]
*  is actually proof that they were [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=403.3s)]
*  lying since they called the [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=405.24s)]
*  messages attack plans as opposed to [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=406.92s)]
*  war plans. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=409.12s)]
*  So we're going to engage in [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=410.0s)]
*  the inevitable semantics nonsense. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=411.68s)]
*  Here are the attack plans that [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=414.56s)]
*  Trump's advisors shared on Signal. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=416.76s)]
*  Look, I don't care if they call it [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=420.40000000000003s)]
*  attack plans or war plans. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=422.40000000000003s)]
*  It is bad that you have high level [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=424.40000000000003s)]
*  Trump administration officials [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=426.6s)]
*  communicating on an unsecured app [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=428.8s)]
*  and accidentally including a [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=430.96s)]
*  journalist who they allegedly didn't [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=432.8s)]
*  want to include in those [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=435.16s)]
*  conversations. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=436.6s)]
*  Obviously, there is a security [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=438.04s)]
*  failure here. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=439.72s)]
*  They got caught and [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=440.68s)]
*  they refused to take responsibility. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=441.72s)]
*  And for me, that's the biggest [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=443.64s)]
*  issue. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=445.04s)]
*  Look, mistakes happen. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=445.68s)]
*  I hate the fact that they use [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=447.08s)]
*  this app. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=448.12s)]
*  Obviously, they shouldn't be doing [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=448.64s)]
*  it. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=450.0s)]
*  But if they took responsibility and [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=450.5s)]
*  apologize and said, look, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=452.16s)]
*  we're going to take steps to [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=453.52000000000004s)]
*  prevent this from happening in [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=454.86s)]
*  the future, we'd be done with it. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=456.12s)]
*  And we wouldn't have to waste more [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=457.6s)]
*  time focusing on this story. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=459.08000000000004s)]
*  But the reason why we're focusing [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=460.72s)]
*  on the story is because they're [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=462.12s)]
*  acting like middle school kids who [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=463.40000000000003s)]
*  can't take responsibility if their [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=464.90000000000003s)]
*  life depends on it. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=466.44s)]
*  And it's pathetic. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=467.44s)]
*  This is not the indication of real [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=468.6s)]
*  leadership in the country. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=470.96000000000004s)]
*  This is the way children behave. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=473.72s)]
*  But let me continue, there's more. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=475.36s)]
*  So as Wall Street Journal national [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=477.72s)]
*  security reporter Alex Ward [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=479.48s)]
*  explains, a war plan is the full [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=480.8s)]
*  scope of an operation, i.e. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=482.48s)]
*  invasion of Ukraine or [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=484.2s)]
*  campaign versus ISIS. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=486.0s)]
*  An attack plan is the acute outline [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=487.88s)]
*  of what will be used to attack [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=490.71999999999997s)]
*  targets. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=492.96s)]

*  most things? [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=711.1600000000001s)]

*  And he's right, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=734.28s)]
*  that's common sense. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=735.08s)]
*  They're not going to be able to [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=736.6s)]
*  control all those guys. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=737.64s)]
*  And so what's interesting is I go [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=739.0s)]
*  on social media and [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=740.72s)]

*  God help me, right? [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=743.84s)]

*  some on the left, right? [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=747.24s)]
*  But I learn a lot from them, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=749.08s)]
*  I see their positions, right? [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=750.12s)]
*  And then some things, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=751.48s)]
*  like a little bit more open than [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=752.5200000000001s)]
*  you would expect. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=754.0400000000001s)]
*  Now some things not at all open in [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=754.88s)]
*  a way that's really discouraging. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=756.44s)]
*  On this one when I posted about it, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=758.36s)]
*  they were halfway open. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=760.0s)]
*  I was like, really? [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=761.2800000000001s)]
*  In the old days, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=762.5200000000001s)]
*  they would have closed ranks. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=763.24s)]
*  No way, nothing was classified. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=764.6800000000001s)]
*  You're all no good libs, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=766.76s)]
*  blah, blah, blah, blah, right? [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=767.9200000000001s)]
*  And there was plenty of that, but [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=769.32s)]
*  there was a whole third or so who [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=771.12s)]
*  were like, yeah, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=772.8399999999999s)]
*  this is a major screw up. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=773.7199999999999s)]
*  I don't know why they did this. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=775.4799999999999s)]
*  And why are they obviously lying? [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=777.28s)]
*  And I realized after seeing [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=779.52s)]
*  the Portnoy clip, and [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=780.76s)]
*  I happened to run into it in [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=781.8s)]
*  a different way. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=783.16s)]
*  I'm like, there you go. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=784.92s)]
*  It's because they're hearing it [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=786.92s)]
*  from the media that they watch and [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=788.4799999999999s)]
*  they listen, and it's no longer [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=790.16s)]
*  just Sean Hannity of Fox News. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=791.88s)]
*  Now it's a variety of sources, and [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=793.92s)]
*  some of them are actually even [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=795.76s)]
*  honest, whether we like it or [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=797.24s)]
*  not on different issues. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=798.68s)]
*  And here I do like it and [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=800.28s)]
*  appreciate the honesty. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=801.1999999999999s)]
*  So last couple things from me on [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=802.48s)]
*  the substance of this. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=803.84s)]
*  An attack plan, as Anna read from [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=805.04s)]
*  the expert, of course is more [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=806.52s)]
*  sensitive than even a war plan. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=807.9200000000001s)]
*  It's, they literally said where [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=809.6800000000001s)]
*  they're going to bomb, when they're [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=811.36s)]
*  going to bomb, who they're going to [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=813.12s)]
*  bomb, that nothing is more [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=814.6800000000001s)]
*  sensitive than that. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=816.2s)]
*  And now I want you to imagine, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=817.32s)]
*  imagine that it was not [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=819.08s)]
*  the Secretary of Defense. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=820.28s)]
*  It was a lower level [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=822.36s)]
*  Pentagon official. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=823.6s)]
*  And he made the mistake of sending [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=825.84s)]
*  these specific attack plans before [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=827.96s)]
*  they happen to a reporter. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=830.28s)]
*  Would he be fired? [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=832.36s)]
*  100%, everyone knows whether it's [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=834.2s)]
*  a Democratic or [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=836.24s)]
*  Republican administration. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=837.12s)]
*  If you're not at the very top and [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=838.84s)]
*  you made this kind of error, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=840.7600000000001s)]
*  you will definitely be fired, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=842.36s)]
*  right? [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=844.0s)]
*  But the elites get away with [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=844.88s)]
*  everything. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=846.0s)]
*  So that's point one. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=846.8000000000001s)]
*  Point two is, imagine if someone in [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=847.5200000000001s)]
*  the Pentagon who was a Democrat but [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=849.48s)]
*  was a civil servant leaked this [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=851.48s)]
*  information on purpose to a [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=853.32s)]
*  reporter. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=855.12s)]
*  They might charge him with treason. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=857.5200000000001s)]
*  I mean, they're looking for [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=859.8800000000001s)]
*  leakers within the administration [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=861.24s)]
*  as we speak. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=863.08s)]
*  That was something that Tulsi [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=863.96s)]
*  Gabbard herself had announced just [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=865.36s)]
*  days prior to the scandal [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=867.2s)]
*  happening. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=868.36s)]
*  And so they take that very [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=869.4000000000001s)]
*  seriously. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=870.8000000000001s)]
*  I understand why they would take [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=871.88s)]
*  that very seriously. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=873.4000000000001s)]
*  But if you are very much concerned [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=874.44s)]
*  about sensitive information or [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=876.84s)]
*  classified information being leaked [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=879.0s)]
*  to the general public, well, then [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=881.5600000000001s)]
*  you have to also look inward at [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=883.76s)]
*  your own behavior and question [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=885.4000000000001s)]
*  whether or not you're doing [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=887.0400000000001s)]
*  anything that jeopardizes that [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=888.44s)]
*  classified material. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=890.0400000000001s)]
*  Using a third party app like [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=891.16s)]
*  Signal falls under that category, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=892.92s)]
*  an unsecured app that could [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=895.0799999999999s)]
*  be hacked into. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=896.88s)]
*  In fact, there are government [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=898.12s)]
*  agencies that are not allowed to [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=899.68s)]
*  have the app downloaded on their [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=901.48s)]
*  government issued phones for [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=903.24s)]
*  a reason. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=905.0s)]
*  So again, it's not the end of [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=906.1999999999999s)]
*  the world to admit that mistakes [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=907.76s)]
*  were made, to apologize, to say it [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=909.56s)]
*  won't happen again, move forward, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=911.4s)]
*  find who's guilty of making [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=913.24s)]
*  the mistake and see what kind of [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=914.6s)]
*  consequences make sense. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=916.0799999999999s)]
*  But we don't live in that era [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=917.16s)]
*  anymore in this country and [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=918.4399999999999s)]
*  in a very long time. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=919.76s)]
*  So instead of immediately having [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=921.32s)]
*  that knee-jerk reaction of [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=923.08s)]
*  providing cover for [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=924.44s)]
*  your preferred politicians, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=925.52s)]
*  we as Americans should demand more [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=927.12s)]
*  from politicians overall regardless [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=929.0s)]
*  of which party they're from. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=930.9200000000001s)]
*  I think it's insulting to have [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=933.0s)]
*  administration officials lying to [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=934.72s)]
*  the American public, including to [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=936.8000000000001s)]
*  their own supporters. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=938.76s)]
*  Yeah, last two things. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=939.84s)]
*  Why do they use Signal in [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=941.9200000000001s)]
*  the first place? [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=942.84s)]
*  And the answer to that is because [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=943.8000000000001s)]
*  they didn't want it on the record. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=945.12s)]
*  Because things that are on [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=946.64s)]
*  the government record eventually [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=947.6800000000001s)]
*  historians find out about it. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=949.48s)]
*  This would not have been a FOIA [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=951.36s)]
*  request, which because it's top [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=953.08s)]
*  seat, presumably would have been [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=954.88s)]
*  in the real world top secret. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=956.5600000000001s)]
*  But could they have found out other [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=957.7600000000001s)]
*  things about these people's [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=959.88s)]
*  opinions if they did it on official [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=961.7600000000001s)]
*  communication lines? [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=964.1600000000001s)]
*  Maybe, and that's why they're using [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=966.6800000000001s)]
*  Signal so that they're not [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=968.72s)]
*  revealed, right? [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=970.2s)]
*  Now, when you look at what they [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=971.44s)]
*  actually said, again, I think that [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=972.96s)]
*  JD Vance arguing against the [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=974.7600000000001s)]
*  strikes was surprising and positive. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=976.32s)]
*  And he was having a polite debate [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=978.92s)]
*  with the two neocons there, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=980.9599999999999s)]
*  Mike Wolce and Pete Hegseth. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=982.7199999999999s)]
*  And they both wanted to strike and [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=985.16s)]
*  Vance was a little bit more [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=986.8399999999999s)]
*  cautious about it. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=988.1999999999999s)]
*  And they said, the Europeans can't [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=989.4s)]
*  strike, only we can do this or [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=991.4799999999999s)]
*  Israel. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=993.28s)]
*  They had this hilarious line of, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=994.4399999999999s)]
*  well, Israel might beat us to it, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=996.12s)]
*  but then they would, of course, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=997.8399999999999s)]
*  ask us to pay for it. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=999.4399999999999s)]
*  And they all assumed that obviously [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=1000.64s)]
*  then we would have to pay for it. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=1002.8s)]
*  That was an incredible part of [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=1004.88s)]
*  the story, it really was. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=1006.48s)]
*  Yeah, and almost no one's talking [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=1008.04s)]
*  about that. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=1009.4399999999999s)]
*  And the last funny part of [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=1009.9399999999999s)]
*  the story is Mike Wolce is like, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=1011.0799999999999s)]
*  I don't even know Jeffrey Goldberg. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=1012.5999999999999s)]
*  How did his number get in your [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=1014.36s)]
*  phone? [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=1017.28s)]
*  That's hilarious, right? [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=1018.56s)]
*  And the reason he's denying that is [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=1020.56s)]
*  because obviously he was a secret [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=1022.52s)]
*  source for another story or [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=1024.32s)]
*  two with Jeffrey Goldberg. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=1025.84s)]
*  And that's why he's trying to deny [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=1027.96s)]
*  it. So I'm curious which stories he [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=1029.3999999999999s)]
*  leaked. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=1031.04s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=1031.76s)]
*  an angel gets his wings. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=1033.32s)]
*  Totally not true, but [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=1034.8799999999999s)]
*  it does keep you updated on [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=1036.0s)]
*  live shows. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq8h49zoKcQ&t=1037.36s)]
