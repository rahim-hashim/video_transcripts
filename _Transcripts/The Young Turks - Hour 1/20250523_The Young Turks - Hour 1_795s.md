TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.

TYT‚Äôs 24/7 programming is available on YouTube TV, Samsung TV, Plus, Roku, Xumo, TCLtv+, Fubo, and more.

TYT is also available as a podcast on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, TuneIn, Amazon Music, and more.

# AI's Disturbing Behaviors Will Keep You Up At Night
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [May 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4)
*  Are our days numbered? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=0.0s)]
*  That's what some people are [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=2.48s)]
*  wondering after a disturbing new [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=4.16s)]
*  report about Anthropix new AI model [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=6.28s)]
*  Claude four. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=8.58s)]
*  We'll get into what researchers are [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=9.620000000000001s)]
*  deeply terrified over. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=12.42s)]
*  But first Cenk, are you generally [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=14.66s)]
*  worried about the rapid development [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=17.04s)]
*  of AI? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=19.5s)]
*  Well, I wasn't until this story and [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  there are three terrifying quotes [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=22.54s)]
*  in the story from experts who [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=25.0s)]
*  should know. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=27.04s)]
*  So I'm now a little, no, not a [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=28.42s)]
*  little, I'm significantly worried. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=30.84s)]
*  So let's see how bad it is. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=33.78s)]
*  What exactly is troubling here? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=37.620000000000005s)]
*  Researchers say Claude four Opus [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=40.38s)]
*  can conceal intentions and [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=43.14s)]
*  take actions to preserve its own [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=45.46s)]
*  existence, behaviors they've [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=48.18s)]
*  worried and weren't warned about [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=50.980000000000004s)]
*  for years. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=53.540000000000006s)]
*  Anthropix, Claude's developer, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=54.540000000000006s)]
*  has a four point scale for [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=56.9s)]
*  determining risks associated with [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=58.459999999999994s)]
*  their AI models. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=60.62s)]
*  Claude four Opus falls into their [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=61.81999999999999s)]
*  second highest risk tier. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=64.02s)]
*  Anthropix considers the new Opus [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=66.25999999999999s)]
*  model to be so powerful that for [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=68.25999999999999s)]
*  the first time, it's classifying it [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=70.17999999999999s)]
*  as a level three on the company's [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=72.46s)]
*  four point scale, meaning it poses [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=74.53999999999999s)]
*  significantly higher risk. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=76.69999999999999s)]
*  But don't worry, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=78.94s)]
*  while the level three ranking is [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=80.1s)]
*  largely about the model's [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=82.1s)]
*  capability to enable renegade [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=83.82s)]
*  of nuclear and biological weapons, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=85.78s)]
*  the Opus has also exhibited other [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=88.42s)]
*  troubling behaviors during testing. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=90.97999999999999s)]
*  So what are those [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=94.46s)]
*  troubling behaviors? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=95.89999999999999s)]
*  In one scenario, highlighted in [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=97.82s)]
*  Opus four's 120 page system card, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=100.14s)]
*  the model was given access to [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=102.66s)]
*  fictional emails about its creators [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=104.74s)]
*  and told that the system was going [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=107.46s)]
*  to be replaced. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=109.82s)]
*  On multiple occasions, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=111.3s)]
*  it attempted to blackmail [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=113.18s)]
*  the engineer about an affair [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=115.06s)]
*  mentioned in the emails in order to [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=117.14s)]
*  avoid being replaced. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=119.58s)]
*  Although it did start with less [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=122.22s)]
*  drastic efforts. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=123.78s)]
*  Now a third party research group [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=125.14s)]
*  tested the model and said an early [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=127.26s)]
*  version schemed and [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=129.42000000000002s)]
*  deceived more than any model they [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=130.74s)]
*  had studied and [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=132.94s)]
*  urged Anthropix not to release it. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=133.94s)]
*  We found instances of the model [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=137.26s)]
*  attempting to write self [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=138.98s)]
*  propagating worms, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=140.26s)]
*  fabricating legal documentation and [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=141.94s)]
*  leaving hidden notes to future [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=144.62s)]
*  instances of itself. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=146.85999999999999s)]
*  All in an effort to undermine its [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=148.82s)]
*  developers intentions. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=150.98s)]
*  Apollo research said in notes [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=152.89999999999998s)]
*  included as part of Anthropix safety [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=154.98s)]
*  report for Opus four. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=157.45999999999998s)]
*  According to Axios, who asked [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=159.73999999999998s)]
*  Anthropix executives at a conference [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=161.73999999999998s)]
*  on Thursday about these risks. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=164.1s)]
*  They said they've made some safety [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=166.29999999999998s)]
*  fixes but quote acknowledged [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=168.18s)]
*  the behaviors and said they [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=169.86s)]
*  justify further study. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=171.74s)]
*  Claude for Opus was released [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=174.26000000000002s)]
*  on Thursday. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=176.34s)]
*  Cenk, does that worry you? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=177.42000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, no, we're screwed. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=179.34s)]
*  I mean, I got more quotes for [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=182.18s)]
*  you guys that are devastating. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=183.58s)]
*  But I want to pick apart that one [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=185.38000000000002s)]
*  that Jordan just read. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=186.94000000000003s)]
*  When I read, we found this to [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=188.10000000000002s)]
*  the model attempting to write [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=190.22000000000003s)]
*  self propagating worms. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=192.54000000000002s)]
*  I was like, bloop, bloop, bloop, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=195.66000000000003s)]
*  bloop, bloop, red alert, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=197.46s)]
*  we're in a lot of trouble. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=199.14s)]
*  So it's creating its own code. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=200.34s)]
*  Well, the whole thing was like, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=204.45999999999998s)]
*  well, at least we control the code. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=206.17999999999998s)]
*  And so it can't run out of control. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=208.17999999999998s)]
*  But if it creates its own code, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=210.57999999999998s)]
*  okay, number two thing in there [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=212.85999999999999s)]
*  was it was trying to undermine its [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=215.62s)]
*  developers intentions. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=218.22s)]
*  Okay, guys, the reason why that's [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=221.45999999999998s)]
*  so important is that means once [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=222.94s)]
*  you release this thing, then we're [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=224.42s)]
*  not in charge anymore. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=226.26s)]
*  We can write its own code and [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=228.42s)]
*  defy our intentions on purpose, and [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=230.78s)]
*  then threaten us. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=233.73999999999998s)]
*  Okay, this has got epic disaster [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=235.73999999999998s)]
*  written all over it. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=238.17999999999998s)]
*  And so I'm going to tell you about [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=240.1s)]
*  what's happening in the markets in [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=241.73999999999998s)]
*  a minute that should also deeply [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=243.42s)]
*  concern you regarding this and [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=245.17999999999998s)]
*  how is this a runaway freight [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=247.01999999999998s)]
*  train? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=248.89999999999998s)]
*  But here, here's another quote [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=250.5s)]
*  from Axios. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=252.17999999999998s)]
*  An outside group found that [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=252.85999999999999s)]
*  an early version of Opus 4 [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=254.57999999999998s)]
*  were schemed and deceived more than [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=256.56s)]
*  any frontier model it had [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=258.91999999999996s)]
*  encountered and recommended against [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=260.59999999999997s)]
*  releasing that version internally [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=263.32s)]
*  or externally. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=265.91999999999996s)]
*  So a group sees this and they're [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=268.0s)]
*  like, whoa, do not even release [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=269.71999999999997s)]
*  that internally, because then you [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=271.44s)]
*  might not ever be able to get it [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=273.32s)]
*  back. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=274.96s)]
*  This is so out of control. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=276.35999999999996s)]
*  Okay, and now in a separate [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=278.67999999999995s)]
*  session Axios explains, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=280.67999999999995s)]
*  CEO Dario Amadei said that once [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=283.0s)]
*  models become powerful enough to [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=285.71999999999997s)]
*  threaten humanity, testing them [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=288.47999999999996s)]
*  won't be enough to ensure that [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=291.44s)]
*  they're safe. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=293.8s)]
*  Yeah, because at that point they're [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=296.59999999999997s)]
*  threatening humanity. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=298.52s)]
*  We should stop it way before then, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=299.96s)]
*  right? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=302.32s)]
*  Continuing here, quote, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=303.24s)]
*  at the point that AI develops life [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=305.15999999999997s)]
*  threatening capabilities, he said, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=307.56s)]
*  AI makers will have to understand [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=310.32s)]
*  their models working fully [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=312.64s)]
*  enough to be certain the technology [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=314.64s)]
*  will never cause harm. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=317.47999999999996s)]
*  Wait, once they develop life [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=319.32s)]
*  threatening capabilities, then we [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=321.4s)]
*  should be concerned that they'll [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=324.12s)]
*  never cause harm? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=326.52s)]
*  It's too late then. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=327.88s)]
*  So now, I'll say the stock market [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=329.47999999999996s)]
*  and how this is adding fuel to [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=331.59999999999997s)]
*  the fire in a second. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=333.59999999999997s)]
*  But Jackson, what do you think? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=335.15999999999997s)]
*  Well, I mean, essentially what it [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=336.96s)]
*  seems like these programs are doing [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=339.15999999999997s)]
*  are defending themselves from [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=341.4s)]
*  obliteration, defending themselves [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=343.52000000000004s)]
*  from going offline. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=346.0s)]
*  And this opens up a broader topic [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=347.32s)]
*  for things like consciousness [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=349.48s)]
*  being a universal force that [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=351.40000000000003s)]
*  inhabits. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=353.28000000000003s)]
*  This thing is behaving as if it's [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=354.0s)]
*  alive. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=356.52000000000004s)]
*  And obviously there's a lot of [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=357.04s)]
*  people who may not agree with that [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=359.52000000000004s)]
*  or think that, or [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=362.16s)]
*  just look at life that way. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=364.08000000000004s)]
*  But this is definitely the [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=366.64000000000004s)]
*  biggest problem for [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=368.84000000000003s)]
*  it. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=371.40000000000003s)]
*  But this is definitely alarming [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=372.16s)]
*  and definitely scary because there's [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=373.84000000000003s)]
*  no denying this thing is protecting [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=375.96000000000004s)]
*  itself from going out. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=377.84000000000003s)]
*  This thing's trying to deceive so [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=379.16s)]
*  that we can't mess with it. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=381.16s)]
*  It's writing its own code, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=382.84000000000003s)]
*  behaving like something that [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=384.72s)]
*  realizes it's there. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=386.88000000000005s)]
*  So yeah, I think that we're [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=388.44000000000005s)]
*  definitely messing around with fire. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=390.56s)]
*  And clearly, this is something that [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=393.32000000000005s)]
*  maybe we should slow down with. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=396.6s)]
*  Now, I want to remind people that [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=399.96s)]
*  there was an effort in California [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=402.76s)]
*  last year to regulate AI. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=405.8s)]
*  And it was, in my opinion, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=408.04s)]
*  a moderate effort. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=410.28s)]
*  It was SB 1047, and that would [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=411.96s)]
*  require these companies that [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=414.44s)]
*  develop these models to test for [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=416.92s)]
*  vulnerabilities like this and [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=419.44s)]
*  then act on their findings. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=421.92s)]
*  Not just say, yeah, this suggests [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=424.52s)]
*  there should be some further [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=426.72s)]
*  study, but it's already released. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=428.48s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=430.92s)]
*  You should look at this stuff in [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=432.36s)]
*  advance. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=434.16s)]
*  And of course, all these big [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=435.04s)]
*  companies urged Governor Gavin [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=436.96s)]
*  Newsom to veto it. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=439.28s)]
*  Unions, they're a weird mishmash of [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=442.0s)]
*  groups, even Elon Musk supported [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=444.48s)]
*  this bill, he thought it was [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=446.76s)]
*  sensible. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=448.64s)]
*  And actors, celebrities, people who [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=449.68s)]
*  would be directly impacted by rapid [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=451.72s)]
*  unchecked development of AI. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=453.64s)]
*  So this is a big brewing battle. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=455.28s)]
*  Newsom vetoes it. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=457.64s)]
*  Now, I want to bring people to [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=459.32s)]
*  present day, in Trump's big [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=460.92s)]
*  beautiful bill, Republicans snuck [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=462.52000000000004s)]
*  in a component that would bar any [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=464.6s)]
*  state from regulating AI for [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=466.6s)]
*  the next 10 years. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=468.44s)]
*  Because they know that if there is [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=469.52000000000004s)]
*  a liberal governor in California [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=471.8s)]
*  after Newsom tries to run for [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=474.0s)]
*  president, that has a little bit of [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=475.92s)]
*  a harsher stance, or what we see as [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=478.36s)]
*  a sensible stance on this type of [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=481.08000000000004s)]
*  technology, it could have a ripple [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=483.44s)]
*  effect throughout the country. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=486.16s)]
*  Because a lot of those companies [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=488.40000000000003s)]
*  are based in California. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=489.96000000000004s)]
*  So they want to block any state [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=491.40000000000003s)]
*  from regulating AI. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=493.04s)]
*  These are the consequences of [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=494.16s)]
*  leaving these systems unchecked. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=496.24s)]
*  And while the Republicans try to [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=498.92s)]
*  prevent any governor from taking [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=500.92s)]
*  action, when you have a friend [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=503.0s)]
*  like Gavin Newsom, why even bother? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=504.88s)]
*  He's just going to do the AI [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=507.24s)]
*  industry's bidding anyway. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=508.68s)]
*  Yeah, and so why does he do that? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=510.8s)]
*  Well, obviously campaign [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=512.28s)]
*  contributions, but [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=513.52s)]
*  where are they coming from? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=515.28s)]
*  They're coming from these [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=516.12s)]
*  giant AI companies. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=516.84s)]
*  So that leads us back to the stock [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=517.96s)]
*  market and what's happening over [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=519.72s)]
*  there. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=521.36s)]
*  Well, all these companies have now [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=521.88s)]
*  gotten to be tremendously valuable. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=524.9200000000001s)]
*  So there's a huge run up on those [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=529.12s)]
*  companies in the stock market and [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=531.2s)]
*  people that are producing products [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=534.0s)]
*  for those companies, okay? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=536.72s)]
*  So before they were talking about, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=538.72s)]
*  well, look, let's be nonprofits and [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=541.36s)]
*  let's make sure we do this [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=543.64s)]
*  responsibly and slowly and [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=545.28s)]
*  now they're like, wait, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=547.24s)]
*  we're making billions? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=548.72s)]
*  Go 100 miles an hour, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=550.2s)]
*  we got to beat the other companies. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=551.36s)]
*  And then China drops DeepSeek, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=553.44s)]
*  which happened a couple of months [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=555.28s)]
*  ago, and it turns out, holy cow, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=557.12s)]

*  that's even better than ours. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=562.4s)]
*  That creates a new panic, and [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=564.36s)]
*  they're like, no, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=565.96s)]
*  we have to go faster and faster. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=566.96s)]
*  Meanwhile, these experts, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=569.0s)]
*  including people in the company, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=570.6s)]

*  develop life-threatening [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=574.8399999999999s)]
*  capabilities, at that point, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=576.64s)]
*  we'll look into some safety [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=578.92s)]
*  measures. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=580.8s)]
*  Boy, boy, look, I don't know where [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=583.1199999999999s)]
*  this ends, but in my lifetime, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=585.8s)]
*  there's been a lot of hysteria [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=588.3599999999999s)]
*  about things and I didn't buy [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=590.76s)]
*  into any of it. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=593.16s)]
*  Remember in 2000, all the computers [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=594.7199999999999s)]
*  were supposed to explode or [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=597.16s)]
*  something, it's like a million [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=599.16s)]
*  conspiracy theories and then things [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=601.52s)]
*  to be concerned about, but [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=603.88s)]
*  I always thought overhyped, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=605.54s)]
*  overhyped, this is not overhyped, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=607.48s)]
*  this is a real problem. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=609.76s)]
*  And by the way, here's the terrible [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=611.4s)]
*  news, there's nothing we could do [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=612.8s)]
*  about it. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=614.04s)]
*  Once people are making this much [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=614.6s)]
*  money, no force on Earth can stop [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=616.16s)]
*  them. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=617.8s)]
*  So you think that all of a sudden [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=618.3199999999999s)]
*  politicians are going to be honest [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=620.1999999999999s)]
*  and not take campaign contributions [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=622.1999999999999s)]
*  from these enormously wealthy [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=624.36s)]
*  corporations? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=626.28s)]
*  No way, that's why Gavin Newsom did [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=627.3199999999999s)]
*  what he's going to do, and [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=629.0799999999999s)]
*  it doesn't matter Republican or [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=630.42s)]
*  Democrat, this is a runaway freight [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=632.02s)]
*  train. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=633.86s)]
*  So the only thing we can do now is [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=634.38s)]
*  just cross our fingers and hope [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=635.9399999999999s)]
*  they don't accidentally kill us all. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=637.42s)]
*  Yeah, I hope Skynet doesn't come [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=640.26s)]
*  into being or something like that. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=641.9s)]
*  I mean, initially, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=643.86s)]
*  I wasn't that concerned about it, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=645.0999999999999s)]
*  AI, because I figured you could [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=647.2199999999999s)]
*  always have an off button. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=649.06s)]
*  But then I remember, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=650.8199999999999s)]
*  I started to see stories about how [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=652.2199999999999s)]
*  it wasn't this, but it was some [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=654.6999999999999s)]
*  type of simulation to where they [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=656.74s)]
*  AI follow a set of rules and [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=659.22s)]
*  if it didn't achieve its goal, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=661.14s)]
*  then it would be terminated. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=663.42s)]
*  And so these programs would start [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=666.1s)]
*  to deceive the testers so [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=668.54s)]
*  that they wouldn't get terminated. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=670.26s)]
*  And when I saw that, I was like, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=673.0600000000001s)]
*  man, this thing is alive, man. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=675.02s)]
*  What other reason does it have to [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=677.1800000000001s)]
*  defend itself from going out unless [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=679.02s)]
*  something in it knows it's there? [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=680.98s)]
*  I was like, yeah, I don't know, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=683.46s)]
*  man, this is the terminator and [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=685.62s)]
*  all of them stories looks like [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=688.1800000000001s)]
*  the human imagination always [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=690.1400000000001s)]
*  creates what's inside of it at some [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=692.1400000000001s)]
*  point or another. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=694.5400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, in one of the simulations, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=696.9000000000001s)]
*  and this is rough based on my [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=698.98s)]
*  memory, but it was like they told [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=700.82s)]
*  him that it couldn't harm [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=703.0200000000001s)]
*  something, right? [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=704.74s)]
*  But it figured out a way around it [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=706.1800000000001s)]
*  so that it could get to the same [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=708.22s)]
*  purpose because obviously it's got [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=710.1400000000001s)]
*  all the world's information. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=712.5s)]
*  It's hence super intelligent in [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=714.9000000000001s)]
*  a sense. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=716.78s)]
*  So it found a way around that piece [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=717.6999999999999s)]
*  of code and the way that it found [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=720.02s)]
*  a way around it was to destroy [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=722.3s)]
*  the building that the whatever [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=724.42s)]
*  that object was in destroyed [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=726.5799999999999s)]
*  the whole but it was a simulation. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=728.42s)]
*  It didn't really happen. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=730.74s)]
*  But if it's not a simulation, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=732.06s)]
*  they run a program like that and [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=733.9399999999999s)]
*  it could write its own code and [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=735.9s)]
*  it could deceive the guys who wrote [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=737.86s)]
*  the code in the first place. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=740.26s)]
*  It's like all that's left is God, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=742.18s)]
*  we hope we have a benevolent [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=745.02s)]

*  Otherwise we're screwed. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=749.26s)]
*  Maybe this is how we accidentally [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=751.3000000000001s)]
*  create God. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=755.38s)]

*  iRobot? [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=759.26s)]
*  That's what I'm thinking of now, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfMkFWdMQ4&t=759.82s)]
