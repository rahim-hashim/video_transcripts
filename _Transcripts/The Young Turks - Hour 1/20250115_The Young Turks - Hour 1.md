# Capitol One BUSTED For Scamming Consumers Out of BILLIONS
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [January 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY)
*  New court filings in a lawsuit [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=0.0s)]
*  against Capital One, allege that [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=2.4s)]
*  the bank basically went out of its [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=5.32s)]
*  way to scam their own customers [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=8.14s)]
*  out of a whopping $2 billion. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=10.68s)]
*  Now, this scheme involves high [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=13.32s)]
*  interest savings accounts, which I [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=15.58s)]
*  hope all of you took advantage of [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=18.18s)]
*  while interest rates were high. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=20.52s)]
*  I know that there are now cuts to [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=22.88s)]
*  the rate, but you could find it [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=24.44s)]
*  back in the day, at least last year, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=25.96s)]
*  you could find a nice savings [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=27.72s)]
*  account with a 5%, 5.5% interest [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=29.24s)]
*  rate, have your money make money [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=31.599999999999998s)]
*  for you. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=33.92s)]
*  Well, this lawsuit has to do with [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=35.28s)]
*  those high interest rate savings [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=37.08s)]
*  accounts that were offered by [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=39.0s)]
*  Capital One. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=40.62s)]
*  Now, this lawsuit, which was filed [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=41.32s)]
*  by the Consumer Financial Protection [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=43.32s)]
*  Bureau, alleges that Capital One, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  which is the ninth largest bank in [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=47.58s)]
*  the United States, introduced [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=49.68s)]
*  a savings account that they titled [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=51.66s)]
*  360 performance savings in 2019. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=53.8s)]
*  Now notice that it has a very [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=58.52s)]
*  similar name to a different [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=60.56s)]
*  savings account that they were [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=62.480000000000004s)]
*  already offering with a much lower [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=64.76s)]
*  interest rate, okay? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=67.28s)]
*  And that was called 360 savings. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=69.12s)]
*  So the higher interest rate one is [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=71.52000000000001s)]
*  called 360 performance savings, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=73.36s)]
*  low interest one, 360 savings, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=75.32000000000001s)]
*  okay? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=77.28s)]
*  Now, when the Federal Reserve began [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=78.24000000000001s)]
*  raising interest rates, Capital One, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=80.52000000000001s)]
*  along with many other banks, also [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=83.04s)]
*  raised the interest rates that they [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=85.24000000000001s)]
*  were offering for high yield [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=87.46000000000001s)]
*  savings accounts as well. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=89.3s)]
*  But they were exclusively doing so [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=91.14s)]
*  for the 360 performance savings [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=93.78s)]
*  accounts, not for [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=96.26s)]
*  the 360 savings accounts. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=97.7s)]
*  Now the 360 performance savings [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=99.86s)]
*  accounts today pay a rate of 3.8%. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=102.46000000000001s)]
*  The older accounts pay 0.5% [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=105.82000000000001s)]
*  according to a Capital One [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=108.5s)]
*  spokesperson. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=110.7s)]
*  Now here is where this scheme gets [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=112.18s)]
*  incredibly nefarious. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=114.66s)]
*  As the Consumer Financial [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=116.98s)]
*  Protection Bureau explains it, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=118.38s)]
*  Capital One eliminated nearly all [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=120.34s)]
*  references to the 360 savings [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=122.58s)]
*  account product on its website and [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=124.58s)]
*  replaced them with references to [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=126.82000000000001s)]
*  the essentially identical 360 [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=128.98s)]
*  performance savings account without [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=131.02s)]
*  notice that the 360 savings [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=133.54s)]
*  continue to exist as a distinct [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=135.58s)]
*  product. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=137.82s)]
*  So if you're a Capital One customer [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=138.62s)]
*  and you already had a 360 savings [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=141.14s)]
*  account that has a much lower [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=143.54s)]
*  interest rate, you wouldn't [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=145.73999999999998s)]
*  necessarily realize that the 360 [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=147.78s)]
*  performance savings is a completely [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=150.26s)]
*  different savings account with [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=152.89999999999998s)]
*  a much higher interest rate. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=155.1s)]
*  You're going to think, I'm already [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=157.45999999999998s)]
*  signed up for that savings [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=158.98s)]
*  account, similar name. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=159.98s)]
*  It gets even more interesting [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=161.29999999999998s)]
*  though because it excluded, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=163.39999999999998s)]
*  meaning the bank excluded [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=165.42s)]
*  360 savings account holders from [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=167.22s)]
*  a marketing campaign advertising [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=169.82s)]
*  the higher interest of the [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=172.45999999999998s)]
*  higher interest yield 360 [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=174.58s)]
*  performance savings to Capital One's [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=176.74s)]
*  other existing customers. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=179.7s)]
*  And it forbade its employees from [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=182.02s)]
*  proactively telling 360 savings [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=184.42s)]
*  account holders about the again [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=186.98s)]
*  higher interest rate 360 [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=189.42s)]
*  performance savings. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=191.58s)]
*  So to be very clear, banks can [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=194.14s)]
*  generally provide as much interest [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=196.66s)]
*  as they want, right? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=199.7s)]
*  So Chase Bank notoriously [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=202.46s)]
*  is going to be terrible when it [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=204.14s)]
*  comes to offering a high yield [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=205.9s)]
*  savings account offer. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=207.73999999999998s)]
*  Usually the interest rate is super [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=209.85999999999999s)]
*  super low regardless of what [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=211.82s)]
*  the Federal Reserve does. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=213.38s)]
*  Even if the Federal Reserve [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=214.62s)]
*  implements incredibly high interest [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=216.34s)]
*  rates, you'll still get offered [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=218.82s)]
*  like a 0.003% savings account from [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=220.9s)]
*  Chase. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=223.26s)]
*  I'm exaggerating a little bit, but [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=223.94s)]
*  really only a little bit. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=226.42s)]
*  But where Capital One went wrong [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=229.1s)]
*  according to this lawsuit is [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=231.1s)]
*  intentionally confusing their own [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=233.02s)]
*  customers with the extremely [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=235.34s)]
*  similar account names and [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=237.34s)]
*  withholding information about [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=239.26000000000002s)]
*  the better savings account from [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=241.46s)]
*  their existing customers who had [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=243.66s)]
*  the account with the lower savings [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=246.02s)]
*  offer, okay? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=248.42000000000002s)]
*  So per the CFPB, the only thing [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=250.62s)]
*  that has ever meaningfully [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=252.74s)]
*  distinguished 360 performance [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=254.54000000000002s)]
*  savings from 360 savings is [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=256.74s)]
*  the former product's higher [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=258.62s)]
*  interest rate. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=260.58s)]
*  So Capital One, of course, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=261.74s)]
*  is disputing the findings of this [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=263.54s)]
*  lawsuit claiming that they did [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=265.7s)]
*  absolutely widely market the 360 [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=267.74s)]
*  performance savings accounts. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=270.14s)]
*  So this is going to go through [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=273.18s)]
*  the courts, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=274.62s)]
*  we'll see what happens. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=275.26s)]
*  But I do want to just talk about [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=276.82s)]
*  what's been going on with [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=278.42s)]
*  the Consumer Financial Protection [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=279.82s)]
*  Bureau in the waning days of [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=281.90000000000003s)]
*  the Biden administration. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=283.38s)]
*  Because remember, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=285.06s)]
*  Trump is coming in and [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=286.18s)]
*  Trump was not friendly to the [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=287.46000000000004s)]
*  Consumer Financial Protection [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=289.06s)]
*  Bureau, he appointed Mick Mulvaney [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=291.18s)]
*  who despised the Consumer Financial [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=293.3s)]
*  Protection Bureau to be the head of [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=295.7s)]
*  that government agency and [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=298.06s)]
*  he was bought off by the payday [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=299.98s)]
*  lenders who of course are loan [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=302.14s)]
*  sharks. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=304.38s)]
*  And so the CFPB prior to Mick [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=305.02s)]
*  Mulvaney had implemented new rules [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=307.22s)]
*  pertaining to payday lenders or [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=309.94s)]
*  same day lenders and Mick Mulvaney [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=312.34s)]
*  came in and dismantled all that. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=315.02s)]
*  So there is good reason for [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=317.34s)]
*  the current members of the CFPB to [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=319.18s)]
*  be concerned that once Trump comes [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=321.5s)]
*  in, he could do some real damage to [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=323.66s)]
*  the agency. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=325.82000000000005s)]
*  So they're currently working [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=327.18s)]
*  overtime 24 seven trying to [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=329.34000000000003s)]
*  accomplish some of the protections, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=331.34000000000003s)]
*  file some of the lawsuits that [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=333.94s)]
*  really do serve the people of this [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=336.02000000000004s)]

*  financial institutions. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=343.06s)]
*  And so per the New York Times, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=344.62s)]
*  the CFPB has taken action against [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=346.3s)]
*  a major financial institution [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=348.3s)]
*  almost every working day for [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=350.06s)]
*  the past month. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=351.90000000000003s)]
*  So look, we're going to have to [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=353.98s)]
*  wait and see what happens when [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=355.74s)]
*  Trump comes in. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=357.54s)]
*  What we do know is that many [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=358.62s)]
*  Republicans are chomping at the bit [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=360.1s)]
*  to get rid of the agency. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=362.22s)]
*  Not because of any real [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=364.22s)]
*  substantive reason, but [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=365.34000000000003s)]
*  because their donors, which are [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=366.70000000000005s)]
*  financial institutions don't like [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=368.54s)]
*  that there's a cop on the beat. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=370.66s)]
*  They don't like that there's [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=372.62s)]
*  a government agency specifically [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=374.3s)]
*  focusing on banks that are [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=376.38s)]
*  defrauding and [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=378.17999999999995s)]
*  scamming American citizens. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=379.09999999999997s)]
*  This is also not a good sign, okay? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=381.85999999999996s)]
*  So obviously, Elon Musk has the ear [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=384.9s)]
*  of the incoming president and [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=387.02s)]
*  he has previously tweeted [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=388.78s)]
*  the following, delete the Consumer [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=390.38s)]
*  Financial Protection Bureau. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=392.34s)]
*  There are too many duplicative [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=393.7s)]
*  regulatory agencies. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=395.46s)]
*  I totally disagree. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=396.73999999999995s)]
*  The CFPB is really the only [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=398.38s)]
*  government agency that has been [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=399.94s)]
*  going after these big financial [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=401.78s)]
*  institutions that are essentially [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=403.65999999999997s)]
*  scamming Americans. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=405.74s)]
*  So he's wrong about that. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=406.82s)]
*  The other thing that the CFPB [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=409.1s)]
*  recently did is they're pushing for [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=410.78000000000003s)]
*  stricter rules in order to prevent [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=412.94s)]
*  people from being debanked. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=415.06s)]
*  And so while you'll hear Silicon [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=417.14s)]
*  Valley billionaires like Mark [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=419.26s)]
*  Andreessen tell Joe Rogan that [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=421.14s)]
*  the CFPB is aiding and abetting or [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=423.22s)]
*  even facilitating debanking, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=425.46000000000004s)]
*  that is not the case at all. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=427.66s)]
*  The CFPB is actually fighting tooth [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=430.78000000000003s)]
*  and nail to prevent people from [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=432.62s)]
*  getting debanked when they've done [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=434.34000000000003s)]
*  nothing wrong. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=436.18s)]
*  Usually the people who are worried [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=436.98s)]
*  about debanking are people who [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=438.74s)]
*  have engaged in potential [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=440.3s)]
*  criminality, but [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=441.62s)]
*  we'll move on from that. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=442.66s)]
*  And look, after the CFPB finalized [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=444.5s)]
*  a rule to cap overdraft fees, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=446.5s)]
*  which we should all be celebrating, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=448.14s)]
*  why should anyone fall prey to [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=450.34000000000003s)]
*  these ridiculous overdraft fees? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=452.18s)]
*  Doge leader Vivek Ramaswamy wrote [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=454.94s)]
*  that in its 15 year history, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=457.1s)]
*  the CFPB has consistently adopted [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=458.98s)]
*  policies that have harmed the very [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=461.26s)]
*  consumers they seek to protect. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=463.42s)]
*  This latest gambit of the CFPB is [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=465.7s)]
*  just a symptom of a deeper and [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=468.14000000000004s)]
*  unconstitutional cancer of unelected [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=470.34000000000003s)]
*  bureaucrats substituting their [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=473.22s)]
*  policy judgments for those of [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=475.5s)]

*  needs to end. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=479.82s)]
*  Well, Vivek, I mean, as we know, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=480.78000000000003s)]
*  the swamp is real thick and [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=483.14s)]
*  the swamp mainly exists among our [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=484.82s)]
*  congressional lawmakers. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=487.06s)]
*  And so the idea that Congress is [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=489.5s)]
*  going to enact legislation to [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=491.78000000000003s)]
*  protect Americans from getting [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=493.98s)]
*  scammed by the very individuals and [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=496.3s)]
*  institutions that fund their [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=498.86s)]
*  campaigns is laughable. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=501.02s)]
*  They haven't and [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=502.86s)]
*  they're not going to, which is why [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=503.82s)]
*  it was so important to institute [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=505.98s)]
*  a specific government agency [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=508.06s)]
*  following the 2008 economic [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=510.14s)]
*  collapse that specifically looks [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=512.14s)]
*  out for the best interests of [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=514.64s)]
*  the people. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=516.6800000000001s)]
*  Because remember, what led to [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=517.62s)]
*  the 2008 economic collapse, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=519.66s)]
*  were these predatory mortgages, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=521.74s)]
*  these adjustable rate mortgages [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=524.18s)]
*  that were doled out like candy to [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=526.5s)]
*  various people who couldn't afford [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=528.6999999999999s)]
*  them, to be quite frank. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=531.14s)]
*  And they couldn't afford them [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=533.02s)]
*  because once the interest rates [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=534.8199999999999s)]
*  spiked, they were unable to pay [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=536.6999999999999s)]
*  their mortgage. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=538.5799999999999s)]
*  So, so many Americans had their [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=539.62s)]
*  homes foreclosed on as a result of [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=541.5s)]
*  the banks doing this, but [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=543.38s)]
*  that was only half of the scheme. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=544.98s)]
*  Remember, the banks then bundled up [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=547.1s)]
*  those toxic mortgages and [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=549.4599999999999s)]
*  traded them on the stock market. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=551.26s)]
*  And when they did that, all these [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=553.1800000000001s)]
*  Americans unwittingly had invested [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=555.82s)]
*  in those toxic securities. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=558.82s)]
*  When the economy collapsed, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=560.98s)]
*  all those people lost half their [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=563.1800000000001s)]
*  stock portfolios. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=565.46s)]
*  I'm talking about hardworking [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=566.74s)]
*  Americans who had slowly but [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=568.4200000000001s)]
*  surely saved for retirement. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=569.9s)]
*  They lost nearly half or more in [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=571.62s)]
*  some cases of their nest egg. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=573.5s)]
*  And guess what the banks who don't [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=575.38s)]
*  have the money to pay their [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=577.62s)]
*  banks, who doled out those toxic [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=579.66s)]
*  mortgages, they bet against those [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=582.1s)]
*  securities and made more money. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=584.78s)]
*  Okay, that was the type of [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=587.5s)]
*  disgusting fraud, abuse, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=589.8199999999999s)]
*  the scam that hurt so many [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=592.54s)]
*  Americans, which is why Senator [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=594.8199999999999s)]
*  Elizabeth Warren pushed for [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=597.62s)]
*  the implementation of the Consumer [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=599.8199999999999s)]
*  Financial Protection Bureau. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=602.2199999999999s)]
*  And they have returned so [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=604.18s)]
*  much money to Americans who have [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=605.8199999999999s)]
*  been frauded by these financial [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=608.02s)]
*  institutions. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=610.1s)]
*  And so don't listen to anyone who [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=611.02s)]
*  tells you that the CFPB isn't [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=612.86s)]
*  looking out for you. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=614.5s)]
*  Because at this moment, with [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=615.62s)]
*  the exception of the FTC under [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=617.58s)]
*  Lena Kahn's leadership, is really [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=619.38s)]
*  one of the only government agencies [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=621.66s)]
*  looking out for [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=623.9s)]
*  the ordinary American. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=624.82s)]
*  And so we really need to protect [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=627.02s)]
*  this agency because I've seen them [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=628.82s)]
*  do really good work. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=630.9s)]
*  But we'll see what happens under [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=631.94s)]
*  Trump, really his first term and [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=633.98s)]
*  how he handled the CFPB doesn't [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=636.62s)]
*  give me a lot of hope. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=638.74s)]
*  But I'm hoping that he proves me [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=640.14s)]
*  wrong. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=642.2199999999999s)]
*  Again, we're going to have to wait [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=643.18s)]
*  and see. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2eBFKn7YY&t=644.38s)]
