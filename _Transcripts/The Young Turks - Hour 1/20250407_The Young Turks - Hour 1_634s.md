"The home had surrendered to its contents.

Vintage cameras lined the shelves. A basement‚Äôs worth of sagging boxes held vinyl records, sorted according to a system only an owner could decipher. There were 11 hammers in the garage. The kitchen counters, barely visible beneath cookware and appliances, featured a food processor still bearing remnants of a past meal."

TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful.

# Union Prez Picks WORST Time To Back Trump
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [April 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M)
*  Tonight, car companies are responding to the president's tariffs. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=0.0s)]
*  Stellantis, which makes Jeep and Chrysler, laid off 900 people at five different plants [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=3.68s)]
*  in Michigan and Indiana. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=8.08s)]
*  As the company says, those layoffs are temporary but necessary because it's pausing production [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  at two of its assembly plants in Canada and Mexico. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=15.06s)]
*  Mr. Fain, you have praised the auto tariffs here, 25% that went into effect last night. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=18.2s)]
*  What's your response to what Stellantis did today? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=23.28s)]
*  Now look, we've been covering so many billionaires who are absolutely infuriated against Donald [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=26.72s)]
*  Trump due to his tariffs policy. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=33.82s)]
*  But on the flip side, United Auto Workers President Sean Fain has actually defended [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=36.68s)]
*  Trump to some extent, which is surprising. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=41.64s)]
*  Now we're gonna hear the rest of his answer to Caitlin Collins right now. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=44.16s)]
*  Let's take a look at what he had to say. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  The administration has been very clear that these tariffs are coming. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=51.76s)]
*  They backed off twice now and now that it's time to be implemented. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=55.76s)]
*  Ford obviously has been proactive. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=62.28s)]
*  They dropped the price of vehicles, they're extending discounts to consumers. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=64.08s)]
*  GM announced they're gonna bring some work back. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=68.6s)]
*  And meanwhile, Stellantis, who's had several months to prepare, announces that they're [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=71.92s)]
*  gonna use employees as collateral damage, it's more of the same. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=75.64s)]
*  There is excess capacity all over this country right now. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=79.24s)]
*  And Stellantis has excess capacity right in Warren, Michigan, where they're laying people [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=82.28s)]
*  off again. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=86.47999999999999s)]
*  They could move ram truck production there in very short order, be producing ram trucks. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=87.66s)]
*  I'm here in Chattanooga, Tennessee right now Volkswagen. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=91.64s)]
*  Volkswagen produces 75% of their vehicles in Mexico. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=94.67999999999999s)]
*  And there's excess capacity right here at this plant. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=98.32s)]
*  So Lordstown, Ohio, Lordstown Assembly Plant, I mean, there's plenty of capacity in this [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=100.8s)]
*  country. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=106.32s)]
*  To be fair, I've heard that argument made by a lot of different people who are defending [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=107.63999999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump's auto tariffs policies, right? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=111.47999999999999s)]
*  So specifically the tariffs he wants to implement on vehicles that are being imported to the [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=114.75999999999999s)]
*  United States. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=120.24s)]
*  They argue, look, we still have factories that have practically been abandoned as a [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=121.28s)]
*  result of offshoring these auto manufacturing jobs. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=126.28s)]
*  We can take those factories, obviously update them, bring them back online, and have these [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=130.12s)]
*  vehicles manufactured here in the United States. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=136.96s)]
*  And also understand the interests at play here. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=139.36s)]
*  Obviously Sean Fain is representing the best interests of workers in the auto industry. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=143.28s)]
*  And so some of these tariffs he sees as potentially good for the auto industry, for workers within [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=147.84s)]
*  the auto industry. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=152.24s)]
*  So if you don't follow politics closely, you might be thinking Sean Fain, was he the guy [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=153.42000000000002s)]
*  who spoke at the Republican convention? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=158.96s)]
*  It's the other Sean that did that. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=160.64000000000001s)]
*  Right, so that's Sean O'Brien, who was head of the team, says gave a fire breathing progressive [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=162.08s)]
*  speech at the RNC, which is really interesting, and helped to get a more progressive labor [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=166.92s)]
*  secretary. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=172.11999999999998s)]
*  So well-planned and he took a lot of heat for it, and Sean Fain was not in that camp. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=173.11999999999998s)]
*  Sean Fain representing UAW was in the camp of rah-rah Democrats and Trump is terrible. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=177.16s)]
*  Now I agree with him that Trump is terrible. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=183.0s)]
*  I didn't agree with him as much on rah-rah Democrats, but that's the position he's been [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=185.04s)]
*  taking. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=189.35999999999999s)]
*  That's why this is more surprising that he's coming out and saying rah-rah Trump on this. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=190.35999999999999s)]
*  Now at the same time, I totally get it for the same reasons I understand that Sean O'Brien [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=194.44s)]
*  reached out, which is you gotta do right for your workers, and that's your only priority. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=199.1s)]
*  They're not Democrats, they don't represent the country, they don't represent a state, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=205.44s)]
*  they represent their unions, and those unions have specific interests. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=208.48s)]
*  Now as it turns out, my honest assessment is that Sean O'Brien played it better than [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=212.04s)]
*  Sean Fain, because he got in, he helped to influence decisions. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=216.4s)]
*  And Sean Fain is agreeing with Trump at his nadir, at it when he's on fire, right? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=221.16s)]
*  And so I don't think that it's made much of an impact, and I still get it. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=227.0s)]
*  He thinks it's better for his union overall, but this is like the worst time to agree with [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=232.9s)]
*  Donald Trump, and these tariffs aren't gonna last and he's gonna be disappointed. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=237.56s)]
*  So at the end of the day, he'll probably get left holding the bag. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=242.38s)]
*  It'll seem like he supported Trump on tariffs that didn't work. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=246.16s)]
*  And not only will that set him back a little bit, it's not that important, his particular [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=250.16s)]
*  political leverage to the rest of us. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=255.12s)]
*  But also, if you care about doing tariffs right, as Ana and I have been talking about [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=257.48s)]
*  over the last couple of weeks, this will hurt that cause. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=261.48s)]
*  So that's why, unfortunately, this is not a great time to back Trump play. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=265.26s)]
*  So look, in regard to the obvious chaos that we're seeing right now in the stock market [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=270.96s)]
*  and the very inevitable issue of inflation that will follow. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=277.0s)]
*  Fain basically says that the tariffs could be at least partially absorbed by corporations. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=281.96000000000004s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=291.96000000000004s)]
*  I mean, look, they're gonna wanna sell products, so they might eat some portion of the costs [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=292.96000000000004s)]
*  associated with these higher tariffs. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=297.88s)]
*  So we have to wait and see if these tariffs remain in place. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=299.72s)]
*  I think in regard to the auto tariffs, that's probably the area where Trump is the most [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=303.15999999999997s)]
*  serious. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=307.0s)]
*  I could be wrong, but that's my read of it. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=308.0s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=309.68s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's not impossible that he would get rid of most of the tariffs but keep [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=310.68s)]
*  a couple. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=314.08s)]
*  So that again goes towards Sean Fain's strategy being right if it goes in that direction. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=315.08s)]
*  But guys, just real quick clarity on prices and how things work. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=321.71999999999997s)]
*  So if you have 30% tariff on something, but the margin of that product is only 15%. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=325.52s)]
*  The company cannot eat the whole 30% tariff, cuz then they'll be losing 15% instead of [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=332.52000000000004s)]
*  making 15%. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=337.62s)]
*  Just giving you that as one example, oftentimes their margins are higher than that. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=338.62s)]
*  But so, and is a corporation going to wanna move most of the costs onto you? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=343.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=349.08000000000004s)]
*  In fact, they'll move as much as the costs onto you as you could possibly afford. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=350.08000000000004s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=353.92s)]
*  And when you get to a breaking point and they think you're gonna go to another company or [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=354.92s)]
*  not buy at all, that's when they'll ease up a little bit. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=358.0s)]
*  But that means you'll eat most of the tariffs and they'll eat a little bit of them. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=361.66s)]
*  But they're never gonna get to a point where it completely erases their profit margin because [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=366.66s)]
*  then they wouldn't do it. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=370.54s)]
*  Of course, of course. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=371.86s)]
*  Now, what does Sean Fain have to say about that? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=372.86s)]
*  Let's take a look. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=375.66s)]
*  Tariffs aren't the solution to everything. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=378.3s)]
*  Tariffs are a tool in the toolbox. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=380.8s)]
*  But ultimately we gotta fix the broken trade system. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=384.90000000000003s)]
*  And that's the part, unfortunately, when we hear all these talking heads talk about the [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=386.94s)]
*  crisis with the stock market dropping. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=391.54s)]
*  Where was the cry out of the crisis when millions of jobs were leaving this country the last [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=394.02s)]
*  20 or 30 years? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=397.86s)]
*  The real problem isn't these tariffs. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=398.86s)]
*  The real problem here is corporate greed. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=400.42s)]
*  I mean, let's talk about the auto industry from 2020 to 2023 when they jacked up the [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=402.02s)]
*  price of vehicles 35%. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=407.9s)]
*  It wasn't because wages went up. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=410.14s)]
*  It wasn't because of tariffs. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=411.5s)]
*  People were manipulating and price gouging consumer because of a pandemic that was in [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=413.5s)]
*  place. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=417.42s)]
*  So, it's a choice. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=418.42s)]
*  Heard this crying all day about the stock market. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=420.1s)]
*  A majority of Americans don't own stock. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=422.9s)]
*  Working class people, 60% don't have any retirement savings. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=425.42s)]
*  That's the crisis in this country. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=429.42s)]
*  That's what we need to be talking about. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=430.94s)]
*  How do we make the trade laws and make these things fair and bring work back that puts [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=432.1s)]
*  people to work where they can have a decent quality of life? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=436.9s)]
*  See, look, this is the reason why I really value the fact that Sean Fain was willing [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=441.94s)]
*  to go out there and say the things that he's saying. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=445.5s)]
*  Because that clip that we just showed you, he's absolutely right. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=447.86s)]
*  And it's amazing how right now there's a 24 hour news cycle. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=452.54s)]
*  I'm like, my God, the stock market, the stock market. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=456.38s)]
*  But as Americans, we're losing everything as a result of corporations moving jobs over [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=459.1s)]
*  to other countries in order to exploit cheap labor. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=463.58s)]
*  No, I mean, yes, there were some people on the left specifically who were complaining [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=466.34000000000003s)]
*  about that. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=470.2s)]
*  But now those folks are so wrapped up in their hatred of Donald Trump that they forgot about [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=471.44s)]
*  how outsourcing American jobs has been absolutely disastrous for American workers, for American [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=475.82s)]
*  labor. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=481.84s)]
*  And that's why I'm not as black and white on this issue of tariffs. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=482.84s)]
*  And the way it's being covered right now in the media, it's very much black or white. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=487.26s)]
*  It's either good or bad. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=490.7s)]
*  It depends, the nuance matters, right? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=492.08s)]
*  So the main reason why I'm frustrated with Trump is this blanket tariffs policy and this [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=494.88s)]
*  weird, ham-handed way that he's implementing or imposing these tariffs is doing away with [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=500.92s)]
*  whatever goodwill exists among Americans in regard to targeted tariffs that actually do [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=505.86s)]
*  look out for American workers. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=511.78s)]
*  Yeah, so look, there's tons of nuance here in that I think some targeted tariffs could [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=514.4s)]
*  work mainly in fighting back against tariffs that were laid against us that were not reciprocal. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=521.48s)]
*  Do I think most of our manufacturing jobs are gonna be outsourced inevitably? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=528.5200000000001s)]
*  I do. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=532.6800000000001s)]
*  Does that mean that we should be okay with all the rules that are in these trade agreements [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=534.36s)]
*  set by corporations? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=541.2s)]
*  No, because corporations write these agreements and they write it for their benefit, not your [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=542.72s)]
*  benefit. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=547.24s)]
*  The number one point that I would make is that we live under corporate rule. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=548.24s)]
*  That's our number one problem. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=551.8s)]
*  These corporations have bought off almost all of our politicians. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=553.32s)]
*  They rig not just one rule or two rules, they rig all of the rules to their advantage. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=556.5600000000001s)]
*  And now they're about to lower their taxes from, they went from 35 to 21%. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=561.52s)]
*  Last summer, the less they pay, the more we pay. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=565.84s)]
*  And now Trump is saying he wants to bring it down all the way to 15%, deregulate more, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=569.48s)]
*  take away fraud charges, etc., which all strengthens corporate rule and is the opposite of populism. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=574.64s)]
*  And last point on this overall is, look, while we do all these nuances that's important about [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=580.76s)]
*  tariffs, the way Trump did it had no nuance. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=586.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=588.44s)]
*  And since he nuked everyone, tariffs wind up looking terrible overall, and it set back [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=589.44s)]
*  everyone. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=595.76s)]
*  And for Sean Fain and Sean O'Brien, I love that there's a new, more aggressive union [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=596.76s)]
*  leadership out there. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=603.02s)]
*  And that is not just listening to the parties, and that is making their independent decisions, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=604.5200000000001s)]
*  right or wrong, in any given circumstance, to fight for their workers. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=610.48s)]
*  And getting the word out, both of them are, about how corporations have rigged all the [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=615.0s)]
*  rules and set this economy to their advantage and against us. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=619.72s)]
*  That's the core of the issue, and that's the thing we all should be united around. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=624.24s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below, an angel gets his wings. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=628.0s)]
*  Totally not true. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=631.0s)]
*  But it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TzhUzEZ-M&t=632.12s)]
