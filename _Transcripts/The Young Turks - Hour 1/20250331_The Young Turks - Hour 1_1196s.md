TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.

TYT‚Äôs 24/7 programming is available on YouTube TV, Samsung TV, Plus, Roku, Xumo, TCLtv+, Fubo, and more.

TYT is also available as a podcast on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, TuneIn, Amazon Music, and more.

*  against anti-Semitism. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=4.44s)]
*  And we must pressure other [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=6.04s)]
*  governments to do the same. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=7.94s)]
*  Is the United States government [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  now just taking edicts and [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=12.08s)]
*  orders from Israel? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=13.66s)]
*  Is this what people voted for when [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=15.0s)]
*  they elected Trump is to have [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=17.32s)]
*  a country taking orders from [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  Israel? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=21.5s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=22.16s)]
*  You just heard from Tim Dillon who [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  isn't some lefty. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=26.2s)]
*  And it is pretty clear that Israel [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=28.080000000000002s)]
*  is calling the shots in the United [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=29.92s)]
*  States as students have their visas [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=31.840000000000003s)]
*  and green cards revoked and [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=33.88s)]
*  are getting arrested simply for [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=35.56s)]
*  expressing criticism of how Israel [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=37.440000000000005s)]
*  is prosecuting the war in Gaza. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=39.72s)]
*  And you don't have to take it from [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=41.760000000000005s)]
*  me. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=43.760000000000005s)]
*  In fact, take it from Israel's [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=44.32s)]
*  Prime Minister, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=45.84s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=46.84s)]
*  These ignorant demonstrators, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=48.24s)]
*  who are they demonstrating for? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=50.36s)]
*  For these murderers, these rapists, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=52.160000000000004s)]
*  these mass killers? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=54.52s)]
*  This is a reflection of a deep rot [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=55.8s)]
*  that has pervaded the intellectual [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=58.36s)]
*  hub of free societies. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=61.2s)]
*  And this vilification of Israel, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=63.96s)]
*  the Jewish people, and Western [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=66.92s)]
*  values has been propagated by [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=69.68s)]
*  a systemic alliance between [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=72.18s)]
*  the ultra progressive left and [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=74.28s)]
*  radical Islam. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=76.68s)]
*  It must be resolutely fought by [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=78.4s)]
*  civilized societies to safeguard [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  their future. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=83.76s)]
*  This is why we must all come in. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=85.84s)]
*  President Trump's decisive actions [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=88.04s)]
*  against anti-Semitism. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=90.0s)]
*  And we must pressure other [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=91.24000000000001s)]
*  governments to do the same. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=93.28s)]
*  I'm just going to comment briefly [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=95.32000000000001s)]
*  on what he had to say about [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=97.72s)]
*  a free society in Israel, because [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=99.52000000000001s)]
*  it reminded me of something I came [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=101.76s)]
*  across from my good friend Ben [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=103.96000000000001s)]
*  Burgess on X today. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=105.92s)]
*  He shared a headline with [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=107.4s)]
*  the public. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=108.44000000000001s)]
*  Let's take a look at this. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=108.96000000000001s)]
*  Today's update from the only [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=110.36000000000001s)]
*  democracy in the Middle East, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=111.96000000000001s)]
*  Israeli troops killed 15 Palestinian [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=113.76s)]
*  medics and [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=116.08s)]
*  buried them in a mass grave, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=116.96s)]
*  UN says. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=118.96s)]
*  That's just the latest. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=120.4s)]
*  Yeah, so first of all, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=121.48s)]
*  Israel- Don't protest it though, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=122.92s)]
*  sorry. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=124.36s)]
*  First of all, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=124.96s)]
*  Israel is not a democracy. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=125.48s)]
*  You can't imprison 5.5 million [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=126.6s)]
*  people in open air prisons, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=128.6s)]
*  murder them anytime you like, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=130.12s)]
*  cut off their power, electricity, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=131.76s)]
*  and food and water anytime you like, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=133.76s)]
*  and claim you're a democracy. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=135.76s)]
*  That's absurd, totally absurd. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=137.04s)]
*  In no other country that enslaves [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=141.6s)]
*  5.5 million other people gets to [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=143.48s)]
*  call themselves a democracy. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=145.4s)]
*  So it's always been propaganda from [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=147.36s)]
*  day one. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=149.52s)]
*  Number two, Nanyahu does so [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=150.4s)]
*  much damage in causing anti-Semitism [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=152.52s)]
*  throughout the world. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=155.36s)]
*  He keeps conflating Israel with [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=158.16s)]
*  Jewish people across the world. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=159.64000000000001s)]
*  Those two things are not [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=161.20000000000002s)]
*  the same thing. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=162.04000000000002s)]
*  My friends here in America did not [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=162.72s)]
*  want to help you in your genocide [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=164.48000000000002s)]
*  and ethnic cleansing. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=166.24s)]
*  So stop saying, and by the way, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=167.76s)]
*  take another country. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=169.76s)]
*  Erdogan is doing now monstrous [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=171.36s)]
*  things in Turkey and [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=172.96s)]
*  trying to end democracy there. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=173.96s)]
*  But criticizing Erdogan doesn't [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=176.12s)]
*  mean you're criticizing me, okay? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=177.56s)]
*  I'm criticizing Erdogan. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=179.32000000000002s)]
*  Doesn't mean you're criticizing [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=180.76000000000002s)]
*  Turkish people. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=181.76000000000002s)]
*  But if we did this with every [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=182.32s)]
*  country, we drive hatred towards [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=183.76000000000002s)]
*  every set of people. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=185.44s)]
*  because the Turkish government is [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=186.92000000000002s)]
*  at some point going to do terrible [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=188.12s)]
*  things, and I don't want people to [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=189.36s)]
*  hate Turks over it. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=190.76000000000002s)]
*  The Israeli government is going to [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=191.84s)]
*  do terrible things, is in the middle [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=193.04000000000002s)]
*  of doing terrible things. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=194.36s)]
*  You shouldn't hate Jewish people [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=195.32s)]
*  over it. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=196.44s)]
*  But Nanyahu is constantly trying to [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=197.0s)]
*  confuse you on that, right? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=198.60000000000002s)]
*  My government equals all [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=200.84s)]
*  Jewish people. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=202.20000000000002s)]
*  So that's because he doesn't want [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=203.48s)]
*  his government criticized, right? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=205.0s)]
*  But in reality, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=206.76s)]
*  he's doing massive damage to Jews [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=207.56s)]
*  across the world by equating them [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=209.24s)]
*  with one of the most monstrous [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=210.84s)]
*  governments we've had in our [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=212.32s)]
*  lifetime. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=213.76s)]
*  No, Dick Cheney does not represent [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=214.96s)]
*  all of America, and [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=216.52s)]
*  Nanyahu does not represent all [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=217.48s)]
*  Jewish people in the world. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=219.04s)]
*  Now, but look at what he does, man. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=220.32s)]
*  This guy's a trope machine, right? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=222.48s)]
*  As people are worried about [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=224.76s)]
*  anti-Semitism, he's like, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=226.12s)]
*  now we will pressure all [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=227.48s)]
*  the governments to follow my [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=228.72s)]
*  orders. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=230.28s)]
*  How does that help? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=231.56s)]
*  And I'm glad that Donald Trump has [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=232.56s)]
*  been walked around like a dog. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=234.28s)]
*  I gave him a little biscuit and [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=236.04s)]
*  a treat, and he did exactly as I [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=237.28s)]
*  ordered him. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=238.68s)]
*  Now I will order Germany and [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=239.44s)]
*  France and other countries to do [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=240.72s)]
*  exactly as I said. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=242.28s)]
*  But don't believe in an anti-Semitic [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=243.48s)]
*  trope about how I control [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=245.2s)]
*  the world. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=246.36s)]
*  What are you doing, man? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=246.96s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=248.56s)]
*  Don't do the trope. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=249.84s)]
*  And so, and by the way, they don't. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=251.76s)]
*  Do they control Indonesia? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=253.72s)]
*  No, they don't. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=254.76s)]
*  Do they control Norway and [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=255.32s)]
*  other countries? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=256.44s)]
*  Ireland, no. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=257.0s)]
*  Ireland's an open revolt against [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=257.84000000000003s)]
*  Israel. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=259.56s)]
*  So the trope is not true, but [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=260.08s)]
*  Netanyahu's trying to make it [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=261.96s)]
*  appear like it's true, right? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=263.59999999999997s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=266.03999999999996s)]
*  I think it's really, really [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=267.03999999999996s)]
*  important to differentiate between [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=268.59999999999997s)]
*  Jewish people, okay, and [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=270.76s)]
*  the Israeli government, okay? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=272.4s)]
*  Jewish people do not control [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=275.52s)]
*  the world. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=276.8s)]
*  That is the trope, and [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=277.32s)]
*  it's a disgusting trope. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=278.36s)]
*  The government of Israel controls [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=280.24s)]
*  the United States. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=282.0s)]
*  Yes, that's definitely true. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=283.4s)]
*  It does, it does. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=284.56s)]
*  Let's just keep it real. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=285.12s)]
*  I mean, come on, we're literally, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=286.28s)]
*  by the way, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=288.0s)]
*  how many students at this point? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=288.59999999999997s)]
*  Obviously Mahmoud Khalil was [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=290.12s)]
*  the first student who was arrested, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=291.64s)]
*  sent away. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=293.84s)]
*  No one even knew which detention [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=294.71999999999997s)]
*  center for some days until we [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=296.47999999999996s)]
*  finally figured out where he was. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=298.0s)]
*  He was just the first one. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=300.0s)]
*  There's also Ali Reza Deroudi. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=301.68s)]
*  He is an Iranian student. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=304.84s)]
*  There isn't even any evidence of [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=307.68s)]
*  him engaging in any protest [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=309.8s)]
*  against Israel's war against Gaza. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=311.76s)]
*  And then there's Ozturk, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=314.44s)]
*  who's a Turkish-American. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=316.0s)]
*  Sorry, she's not American, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=318.0s)]
*  she's on a student visa. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=319.36s)]
*  That was in Boston. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=321.12s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=322.44s)]
*  And she's working on her PhD, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=322.96000000000004s)]
*  did an op-ed talking about economic [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=324.32s)]
*  boycott of Israel. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=325.96000000000004s)]
*  They're like, that's it, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=326.92s)]
*  you're under arrest, and [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=328.0s)]
*  you're going to get deported. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=329.04s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=330.04s)]
*  Okay, that's- [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=330.72s)]
*  For an op-ed? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=331.24s)]
*  That is supposed to go against our [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=332.24s)]
*  values as Americans, okay? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=334.52000000000004s)]
*  These students didn't engage in [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=336.72s)]
*  terrorism, they didn't harass [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=338.68s)]
*  Jewish students. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=340.72s)]
*  There's no evidence of that. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=342.20000000000005s)]
*  They simply stated their opinion. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=343.44s)]
*  And in the case of Ozturk, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=346.16s)]
*  she was a co-author in an op-ed for [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=348.24s)]
*  the student paper. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=350.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=352.56s)]
*  Okay, so he's over there, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=353.08s)]
*  Netanyahu's over there bragging [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=354.44s)]
*  about how they managed to get this [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=356.0s)]
*  accomplished. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=357.59999999999997s)]
*  And they want to go further, and [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=358.52s)]
*  let's not forget what he mentioned [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=360.28s)]
*  about this alliance among the [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=362.24s)]
*  progressive left and [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=363.88s)]
*  radical Islam, what? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=365.12s)]
*  Yeah, I want to get to that [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=367.03999999999996s)]
*  in a second. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=368.03999999999996s)]
*  So one last thing about Israel [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=368.56s)]
*  controlling countries, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=370.56s)]
*  does Saudi Arabia and [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=372.36s)]
*  UAE partly control America through [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=373.76s)]
*  their funding of think tanks, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=375.88s)]
*  lobbyist groups, etc., and [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=377.64s)]
*  the way that they funnel money to [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=379.12s)]
*  both parties? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=380.88s)]
*  Yes, yes, it's not just Israel, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=381.76s)]
*  okay? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=384.08s)]
*  But does Israel have significant [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=384.84s)]
*  and massive control over [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=387.32s)]
*  the American government through [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=389.12s)]
*  donations that are legal here in [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=391.44s)]
*  America? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=393.76s)]
*  People who love Israel, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=395.68s)]
*  they're American citizens, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=397.15999999999997s)]
*  presumably, almost we think. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=398.88s)]
*  As far as I know, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=401.03999999999996s)]
*  let's put it that way, they all [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=402.28s)]
*  give and they go, now I want you to [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=404.52s)]
*  support Israel, okay? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=406.88s)]
*  And I don't want any questions, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=408.52s)]
*  I don't want any nuance. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=410.28s)]
*  My group, APAC, Democratic Majority [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=412.12s)]
*  for Israel, etc. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=414.0s)]
*  And they're definitely not [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=415.4s)]
*  supporting Jewish Americans, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=416.8s)]
*  they've actually targeted some [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=418.36s)]
*  Jewish members of Congress. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=419.96s)]
*  And 70% of Democrats, I'm sorry, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=421.44s)]
*  Jewish Americans, by the way, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=423.56s)]
*  voted against Trump, okay? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=425.4s)]
*  So but what they are saying is now [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=427.04s)]
*  we support the Israeli right wing. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=428.84s)]
*  And if you dogs that we give money [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=431.04s)]
*  to, like the drug companies do oil [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=432.76s)]
*  companies, etc., if you dogs don't [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=434.6s)]
*  behave, we will take away your [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=436.68s)]
*  treats. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=438.6s)]
*  And almost 100, not 100, 98% of [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=439.84000000000003s)]
*  the Republican Party, and a huge [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=442.32s)]

*  absolutely, sir, who do you want me [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=449.24s)]
*  to bow to? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=451.48s)]
*  And then standing ovation after [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=452.04s)]
*  standing ovation, you want to [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=453.52s)]
*  commit war crimes, blank check [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=455.08s)]
*  after blank check. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=456.64s)]
*  Does Israel control Washington, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=457.52s)]
*  DC? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=459.32s)]
*  You'd have to be really a giant [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=459.82s)]
*  liar or enormously biased to say [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=461.76s)]

*  twist reality to say they don't. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=467.2s)]
*  Of course they do. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=469.08000000000004s)]
*  So- [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=470.08000000000004s)]
*  Look, this question came up, Cenk, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=470.58000000000004s)]
*  during my appearance on [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=472.88s)]
*  Piers Morgan's show last week, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=474.26s)]
*  right? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=476.08000000000004s)]
*  And it was really interesting [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=476.58000000000004s)]
*  because people usually can't wait [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=477.96000000000004s)]
*  to interrupt you. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=479.6s)]
*  Piers Morgan himself can't wait to [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=480.44s)]
*  interrupt you as you are answering [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=482.08000000000004s)]
*  the question he just asked you. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=483.8s)]
*  But no one interrupted me when I [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=485.40000000000003s)]
*  was saying what I needed to say. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=487.16s)]
*  And so I want to go to video five [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=489.08000000000004s)]
*  here, and you'll get a sense of why [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=491.08000000000004s)]
*  I believe the Israeli government [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=494.08s)]
*  does have control over [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=495.84s)]
*  the American government. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=496.94s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=498.08s)]
*  But this principle of deporting [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=498.76s)]
*  students for their political [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=500.7s)]
*  allegiances or views, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=502.64s)]
*  where do you sit on that? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=504.12s)]
*  I mean, our government will [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=505.84s)]
*  certainly try to do that as long as [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=507.32s)]
*  the government of Israel demands [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=509.12s)]
*  it. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=510.91999999999996s)]
*  And our government, whether you're [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=511.41999999999996s)]
*  talking about Democrats or [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=513.1999999999999s)]
*  Republicans, is completely [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=514.48s)]
*  controlled by the Israeli [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=515.84s)]
*  government, and they're going to [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=517.04s)]
*  do the Israeli government's bidding. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=518.52s)]
*  That's what this is really about. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=520.0s)]
*  That's all it is. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=522.0s)]
*  So protesters who are legal [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=523.04s)]
*  residents, permanent residents who [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=525.24s)]
*  have green cards, will be deported [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=528.0799999999999s)]
*  simply for exercising their [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=530.76s)]
*  freedom of speech and criticizing [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=532.8s)]
*  how the Israeli government is [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=535.24s)]
*  prosecuting this war in Gaza, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=537.28s)]
*  slaughtering tens of thousands of [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=539.48s)]
*  innocent women, children, elderly [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=541.68s)]
*  people, civilians. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=544.0799999999999s)]
*  They're going to continue [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=545.3199999999999s)]
*  the slaughter. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=546.52s)]
*  They don't want any backlash from [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=547.12s)]
*  anyone in the United States about [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=549.04s)]
*  it, including American citizens, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=551.0s)]
*  including permanent residents. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=553.0s)]
*  And remember, Miriam Adelson and [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=555.04s)]
*  the Adelson family overall gave [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=557.16s)]
*  Donald Trump hundreds of millions [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=559.12s)]
*  of dollars to not do what's right [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=561.28s)]
*  for the United States, but [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=563.28s)]
*  to do what's right for Israel. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=564.96s)]
*  So Donald Trump is going to do [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=566.52s)]
*  that. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=568.48s)]
*  I mean, you think Trump is sitting [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=570.72s)]
*  around thinking about these [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=573.08s)]
*  students and how much he himself [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=574.96s)]
*  personally wants to deport them? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=577.08s)]
*  No, he's doing a transaction. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=579.32s)]
*  Yeah, so imagine Trump's like, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=582.0s)]
*  I read that op-ed at Tufts. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=584.4s)]
*  Come on. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=586.28s)]
*  I want to take action on it. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=587.16s)]
*  No, he got an order from APAC to [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=588.44s)]
*  deport the enemies of Israel. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=590.64s)]
*  And he's doing it like a good boy. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=593.28s)]
*  And not even enemies, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=594.8s)]
*  like slight critics of Israel. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=596.24s)]
*  So look, I think that that clip [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=598.56s)]
*  Ana showed you is really [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=600.16s)]
*  interesting because if Ana had said [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=601.64s)]
*  that on CNN just two years ago, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=603.72s)]
*  three years ago, right, she would [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=605.64s)]
*  have been escorted out of [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=607.72s)]
*  the building. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=609.32s)]
*  And the host would have jumped [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=610.08s)]
*  down her throat. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=611.36s)]
*  Every other panelist would have [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=612.2s)]
*  jumped down her throat. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=613.5600000000001s)]
*  Now it's like, well, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=614.76s)]
*  who would object? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=615.92s)]
*  The right doesn't object, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=616.96s)]
*  the left doesn't object. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=618.08s)]
*  Any sentient human being knows that [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=619.16s)]
*  Israel controls Washington, DC. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=621.0s)]
*  And it's not complicated how? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=622.96s)]
*  Through the campaign donations. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=624.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=625.4s)]
*  It's legalized bribery, right? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=625.9s)]
*  So okay, along those lines, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=627.2s)]
*  I was listening to Club Random [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=629.08s)]
*  Podcasts, this Bill Maher's podcast [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=630.96s)]
*  when Andrew Schultz was on. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=633.32s)]
*  It's a really good podcast, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=635.2s)]
*  by the way, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=636.76s)]
*  in that particular episode. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=637.48s)]
*  Andrew Schultz is an interesting [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=639.4s)]
*  journalist, and I convinced Bill [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=641.12s)]
*  Maher on a couple of things that [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=642.72s)]
*  I thought were great. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=644.16s)]
*  Anyways, but when they got to [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=645.04s)]
*  this issue, Bill, of course, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=646.4s)]
*  as always, frothing at the mouth [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=647.72s)]
*  about Israel, right? [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=649.16s)]
*  Mahmoud Khalil's a terrible guy. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=650.4s)]
*  He's filled with hate. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=652.72s)]
*  You don't know anything about [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=656.08s)]
*  Mahmoud Khalil, right? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=657.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=658.08s)]
*  But nevertheless, this is hilarious [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=658.58s)]
*  where me giving Bill Maher credit. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=660.52s)]
*  Okay, nevertheless, he's like, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=662.44s)]
*  yeah, no, we shouldn't deport him. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=664.52s)]
*  That's crazy, even if I hate him. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=666.52s)]
*  Even if I hate his opinions on [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=669.08s)]
*  him, why are we deporting someone [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=670.76s)]
*  for speech? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=672.7199999999999s)]
*  Thank you, Bill. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=674.28s)]
*  Thank you for not being a hypocrite [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=675.04s)]
*  and for living up to what has been [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=677.0799999999999s)]
*  your ideals on free speech for [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=678.92s)]
*  all along. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=680.64s)]
*  So there are actually some on [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=681.5999999999999s)]
*  the right who are condemning what's [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=683.4s)]
*  happening with these green card [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=685.7199999999999s)]
*  students who are being sent away, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=688.0799999999999s)]
*  arrested, their green cards [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=690.56s)]
*  revoked. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=692.64s)]
*  We're going to get to them in just [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=693.7199999999999s)]
*  a minute. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=694.5999999999999s)]
*  But I actually want to go to one [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=695.0999999999999s)]
*  other video because in this next [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=696.4s)]
*  clip you're going to see David [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=697.8s)]
*  Friedman, who actually was Trump's [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=699.32s)]
*  ambassador to Israel in his first [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=702.48s)]
*  term. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=705.2s)]
*  He doesn't just stop at [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=707.44s)]
*  progressives and [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=709.44s)]
*  their critique of Israel. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=711.0400000000001s)]
*  He's also focusing on the right [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=713.6400000000001s)]
*  wing as well. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=715.6800000000001s)]
*  And I suspect that this is waking [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=716.6800000000001s)]
*  the right wing up. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=718.6400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it is not going to play well. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=720.08s)]
*  because if you think that free [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=721.96s)]
*  speech violations are only going to [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=723.24s)]
*  impact the left, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=724.7600000000001s)]
*  you'd be mistaken. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=725.48s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=726.44s)]
*  I condemn anti-Semitism on the right [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=727.44s)]
*  and on the left. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=730.1600000000001s)]
*  I'm an equal opportunity [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=730.7600000000001s)]

*  Yep, 100%. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=945.1600000000001s)]
*  With that in mind, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=946.4s)]

*  So he's a comedian, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=949.84s)]
*  if you're not familiar with him, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=950.72s)]
*  he is not a lefty. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=952.28s)]
*  But he's not really liking what's [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=954.0s)]
*  happening right now with the [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=955.84s)]
*  targeting of these students. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=957.44s)]
*  So let's take a look at what he [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=959.0s)]

*  I don't think that's [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=970.88s)]
*  the right way to go. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=972.32s)]

*  I don't think so. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1015.2s)]
*  She's a legal US resident, [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1016.36s)]

*  And I'm happy to see that it's not [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1035.64s)]
*  just lefties who feel [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1037.68s)]
*  uncomfortable with it. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1039.04s)]
*  You also have people like Eli Lake. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1040.72s)]
*  Eli Lake is a big defender of [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1042.88s)]
*  Israel, has spoken out against [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1044.8400000000001s)]
*  what's happening to these students. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1047.12s)]
*  I give him a lot of credit for [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1048.6s)]
*  that. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1049.8s)]
*  Dave Smith, of course, [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1050.32s)]
*  has been speaking out against this. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1051.32s)]
*  He's a libertarian. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1052.8s)]
*  So more and more people who are [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1054.0s)]
*  Trump supporters are coming out and [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1055.96s)]
*  saying, no, this is not okay. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1058.32s)]
*  This goes against our values. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1060.44s)]
*  And I commend them for that because [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1062.2s)]
*  there's a lot of free speech [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1063.44s)]
*  warriors out there that ain't [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1064.6399999999999s)]
*  really about free speech when it's [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1065.84s)]
*  inconvenient for them. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1067.2s)]
*  Yeah, I literally don't know a [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1068.24s)]
*  single Jewish American that is in [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1070.24s)]
*  favor of these kidnappings. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1072.44s)]
*  Okay, so this isn't to serve Jews. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1074.8s)]
*  This isn't to fight anti-Semitism. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1077.8s)]
*  This is to serve a lobby that is [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1079.96s)]
*  for a foreign government. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1081.8799999999999s)]
*  And so the fact that comedians and [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1083.72s)]
*  right wingers, etc, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1085.76s)]
*  are all waking up going, wait, [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1087.04s)]
*  what did she do against America? [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1089.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1092.96s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1093.46s)]
*  Or what did she do against Israel? [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1094.32s)]
*  You're not allowed to have an [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1096.6s)]
*  opinion about a foreign country, [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1097.72s)]
*  really? [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1099.08s)]
*  Well, apparently, in America, [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1099.6s)]
*  you could be an exchange student, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1101.2s)]
*  you could be a green card holder, [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1102.88s)]
*  resident alien that's legally here. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1104.7600000000002s)]
*  You could have any vicious opinion [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1106.72s)]
*  you like about America or [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1108.8000000000002s)]
*  white people or black people. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1110.2800000000002s)]
*  Or by the way, ironically, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1112.48s)]
*  of Jews, you could say anything [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1114.0400000000002s)]
*  anti-Semitic thing you like. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1115.6000000000001s)]
*  But if you say something against [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1117.16s)]
*  Israel, you're going to be taken [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1118.5600000000002s)]
*  out, okay? [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1120.0400000000002s)]
*  And look, last couple things here, [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1120.88s)]
*  we had this hilarious poll. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1122.6000000000001s)]
*  Does Netanyahu have too much [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1124.3600000000001s)]
*  influence in the United States? [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1125.8400000000001s)]
*  I'm just curious, [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1127.68s)]
*  it's in the live chat, [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1128.44s)]
*  shows at 6 o'clock every day. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1129.48s)]
*  5% believe no. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1130.96s)]
*  Nope, what influence, Netanyahu? [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1134.24s)]
*  But anyway, 95, 5, [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1138.04s)]
*  that's not surprising. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1139.0s)]
*  Last thing is, if you notice there, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1140.2s)]
*  the topic I want to come back to, [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1142.08s)]
*  Netanyahu started saying now [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1143.8400000000001s)]
*  the left in America equals [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1145.52s)]
*  radical Islam. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1147.08s)]
*  So that we're terrorists, right? [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1149.28s)]
*  So now the left has to get locked [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1152.88s)]
*  up, and he didn't say student visa, [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1154.64s)]
*  he didn't say green card. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1156.68s)]
*  He just left equals radical Islam. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1158.28s)]
*  So now if you're on the left, [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1160.92s)]
*  you better watch yourself, [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1162.24s)]
*  because the Israeli thought police [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1163.52s)]
*  might just arrest you if Netanyahu [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1165.24s)]
*  gets his way. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1167.0s)]
*  But as you saw with Friedman, [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1167.88s)]
*  they're saying, well, [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1169.68s)]
*  we start with the left. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1171.2s)]
*  But we're equal opportunity [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1173.4s)]
*  condemners. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1174.8000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1175.48s)]
*  So Tucker Carlson, Candace Owens, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1176.0800000000002s)]
*  and everyone else, you start [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1178.24s)]
*  slightly criticizing Israel. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1180.0s)]
*  We got a jail in Louisiana and [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1182.64s)]
*  then one in El Salvador that [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1184.3200000000002s)]
*  Israel can send you to via [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1185.8400000000001s)]
*  the US government. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1187.24s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1189.6000000000001s)]
*  below, an angel gets his wings. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1191.1200000000001s)]
*  Totally not true, but [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1192.92s)]
*  it does keep you updated on [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KorflXyfIfU&t=1193.96s)]
