# Israel's DEVASTATING Announcement For Desperate Gazans
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg)
*  Hundreds of people have been killed, more than a thousand wounded while looking for [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=0.0s)]
*  food at the private militarized so-called aid sites which replaced UN distribution centers [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=3.96s)]
*  in May. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=10.4s)]
*  The entire population of Gaza, 2.1 million people, experience prolonged shortages of [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=11.44s)]
*  food. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  Half a million are in a catastrophic situation of hunger, acute malnutrition, starvation, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  and illness, according to the World Health Organization. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=23.28s)]
*  Well, aside from the fact that Palestinians continued getting slaughtered at these humanitarian [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=28.72s)]
*  aid hubs by the IDF, and the IDF admits that they would fire warning shots. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=34.64s)]
*  Israel has also decided to halt aid deliveries into Gaza again. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=40.879999999999995s)]
*  And that's according to the Israeli station Channel 12 News. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=46.68s)]
*  Apparently, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is justifying further starving the Palestinian [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=50.56s)]
*  people by doing what Israelis always do, blame Hamas even when they're the ones responsible [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=56.04s)]
*  for the behavior. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=62.519999999999996s)]
*  Now, Netanyahu's office announced that he ordered the military to present a plan within [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=63.519999999999996s)]
*  the next two days on how to keep Hamas from stealing humanitarian assistance. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=68.76s)]
*  So that's the cover story. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=74.2s)]
*  We don't want to deliver aid to starving Palestinians because we're worried Hamas is stealing it. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=76.16s)]
*  In reality, the Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Aid Foundation was luring desperate Palestinians [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=82.26s)]
*  to these hubs where they were supposed to get the aid that they so desperately need. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=89.12s)]
*  And then you'd have IDF soldiers firing on them, as by the way, Israeli Gideon Levy said [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=94.3s)]
*  on Piers Morgan's show just yesterday. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=100.62s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=102.78s)]
*  I must remind ourselves that when the UN agencies distributed the aid, there were no killed [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=104.42s)]
*  people. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=111.26s)]
*  It all started with this monster organization of putting two, three stations in the Gaza [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=112.26s)]
*  Street for 2 million people, almost as an experiment in human beings, in starving human [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=119.74000000000001s)]
*  beings. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=126.34s)]
*  None of them was killed in purpose, all of them by chance, all of them potential threat [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=127.34s)]
*  to the soldiers. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=133.14s)]
*  How dare you to spread this propaganda knowing that you are lying? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=134.14s)]
*  Again, that was Gideon Levy, who is in fact Israeli and has been critical of the Israeli [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=141.73999999999998s)]
*  government in the past. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=146.77999999999997s)]
*  Now, at least 103 Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire over the past 24 hours, local [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=147.77999999999997s)]
*  health authorities said, including some shot near an aid distribution point, the latest [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=154.07999999999998s)]
*  in a series of such incidents. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=159.26s)]
*  The Israeli military had no immediate comment. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=161.06s)]
*  That is the real issue here. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=163.66s)]
*  And this whole notion that Hamas is stealing aid and Israel wants to investigate this in [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=165.9s)]
*  order to find a better way to deliver aid is complete bunk. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=171.62s)]
*  It's nonsense. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=174.9s)]
*  In regard to halting that humanitarian aid from entering the Gaza Strip, the Prime Minister's [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=176.3s)]
*  office came after, or his announcement came after Finance Minister Basilel Smotrich, who [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=180.12s)]
*  wants to starve the Palestinians to death, by the way, threatened that he could no longer [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=186.3s)]
*  remain in the government if immediate action wasn't taken to prevent aid from reaching [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=190.74s)]
*  Hamas. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=196.02s)]
*  Now, any normal person who's not a sociopath would say, good day, sir, go ahead and leave [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=197.02s)]
*  the government, you're not wanted. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=203.26000000000002s)]
*  But of course, there is a fragile coalition that makes up the current Israeli government. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=205.06s)]
*  Without that coalition Netanyahu knows that he'll no longer be in power. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=210.62s)]
*  And of course, he's very much concerned about that. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=214.32000000000002s)]
*  If there's any evidence that's being shown to prove that Hamas is stealing the aid, what [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=218.06s)]
*  the Israelis are circulating online is this video that shows dozens of masked men, some [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=225.14000000000001s)]
*  armed with rifles, but most carrying sticks riding on aid trucks. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=230.02s)]
*  Okay, well, what is that about? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=234.78s)]
*  Turns out the Higher Commission for Tribal Affairs, which represents influential clans [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=236.74s)]
*  in the territory, said the trucks had been protected as part of an aid security process, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=241.3s)]
*  managed solely through tribal efforts. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=247.34s)]
*  The commission said that no Palestinian faction, a reference to Hamas, had taken part in the [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=250.42000000000002s)]
*  process. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=256.38s)]
*  The clans came to form a stance to prevent the aggression and the thieves from stealing [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=257.38s)]
*  the food that belongs to our people. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=262.58000000000004s)]
*  Abu Salman al-Maghni, a representative of Gazan clan, said, referring to a Wednesday operation. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=265.42s)]
*  And look, I don't trust Hamas at all. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=274.54s)]
*  Hamas says they've done no such thing. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=276.58000000000004s)]
*  They've never stolen any humanitarian aid. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=278.38s)]
*  I'm sure that there's been instances where they have. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=280.42s)]
*  But in regard to the video that they're circulating, you have to keep in mind we're talking about [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=282.82s)]
*  starving Palestinians. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=286.3s)]
*  They've been intentionally starved for months and months. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=287.54s)]
*  And so when they see a humanitarian aid truck come through, they're going to rush toward [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=291.02000000000004s)]
*  the truck because they want food. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=295.38s)]
*  They need sustenance to feed their families. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=297.3s)]
*  So the argument here from the Higher Commission for Tribal Affairs is that they're providing [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=299.86s)]
*  security to ensure that chaos doesn't break out. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=304.28000000000003s)]
*  Although these humanitarian aid hubs, Cenk, as you know, have been chaotic and have led [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=308.52s)]
*  to dozens of Palestinians getting shot and killed on a daily basis since late May. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=312.44s)]
*  So the UN and other groups used to do this aid system where they would hand out the food. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=318.12s)]
*  And to Anna's point, to Gideon Levy's point, no one ever got shot at those stations. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=323.72s)]
*  People got the food, it was orderly. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=328.02s)]
*  Largely speaking, Hamas did not steal the food, certainly not systematically. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=331.0s)]
*  There's always bad actors in any given situation. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=334.71999999999997s)]
*  I'm gonna come back to that because I'm gonna knock down a propaganda point of Israel that [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=337.52s)]
*  it's important to knock down. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=341.28s)]
*  But so now that Israel's running the centers, the problem is if you don't have anyone guarding [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=343.4s)]
*  the food on the other side, since people are starving, there's going to be mayhem. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=349.03999999999996s)]
*  And that's part of the reason why Israel did this, because they want the Palestinians [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=354.88s)]
*  fighting amongst themselves. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=357.88s)]
*  They want them desperate and then they want any excuse to kill them. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=359.6s)]
*  So the minute that there's any kind of disturbance by the food, they're like perfect, open fire. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=364.08s)]
*  And they just start slurring, by the way, Israel killed 103 Palestinians yesterday. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=368.16s)]
*  Does anybody notice? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=373.76s)]
*  Is there any big headlines? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=375.16s)]
*  No, they're like, we have 20 hostages, so that's terrible, okay? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=376.16s)]
*  But wait, just on one day alone, would I kill 103 innocent people to maybe put pressure on [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=381.16s)]
*  to get 20 hostages back months later or whenever? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=388.62s)]
*  No, I wouldn't kill 103 innocent people no matter what. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=391.85999999999996s)]
*  And they do it every single day, massacre after massacre. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=395.26s)]
*  It just doesn't get it reported as much anymore because people just got tired of reporting [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=399.5s)]
*  the same old news. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=403.34s)]
*  Israel slaughters more innocent Palestinians every single day. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=405.09999999999997s)]
*  So it's not an accident, they're doing it on purpose. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=409.68s)]
*  Now, the reason you need other people on the other side is order, right? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=411.58s)]
*  So that it doesn't turn into mayhem and people don't hurt each other. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=414.76s)]
*  So since it can't be Hamas, not only Israel doesn't want Hamas, but the Palestinians in [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=417.42s)]
*  that case don't want Hamas to take it because they need it for their family. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=422.3s)]
*  So the traditional tribal clans have stepped in and now apparently Fattah is also coming [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=426.14s)]
*  in. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=431.62s)]
*  They run the West Bank and they are sworn enemies of Hamas, okay? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=432.62s)]
*  So they're trying to make sure that Hamas does not get the food. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=437.84s)]
*  They're doing every effort they can to make sure that doesn't happen. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=440.65999999999997s)]
*  But Israel goes, who cares? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=444.34s)]
*  All dirty Muslims, Fattah, Hamas, they're opposed to each other, tribal clans, who cares? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=446.3s)]
*  It's all an excuse to starve them, to kill them. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=452.18s)]
*  So cutting off the aid, Gideon Levy's right, Anna's right, it's not even close. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=455.1s)]
*  It's definitely because Maslow Smoltrich, his name even sounds demonic, like Blasol. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=458.78000000000003s)]
*  Anyway, it doesn't matter because his name could be perfectly great, his name could be [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=465.42s)]
*  terrible and he could do wonderful things. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=469.56s)]
*  The bottom line is the guy is a certifiable monster. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=471.72s)]
*  So we're not just saying this to get you to, my God, we'll rile you up against some Israeli [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=475.7s)]
*  minister. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=483.26s)]
*  No, what Anna said is literal. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=484.26s)]
*  He said in public, if he could, he'd not only starve the Palestinians to death, he'd make [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=486.02s)]
*  it quicker by cutting the water so that they would all die of thirst. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=492.02s)]
*  But he said, but I can't because of international pressure. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=496.4s)]
*  So we have to pretend to be feeding them and keep them on the brink of starvation. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=500.06s)]
*  He's spoken like a true Nazi and I don't hesitate at all in calling him a Nazi. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=504.14s)]
*  I mean, okay, so now let's use that analogy for a second and I don't care if you get offended. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=510.94s)]
*  I'm 10 million times more offended by the genocide that Israel supporters are protecting [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=515.66s)]
*  and defending right now. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=521.02s)]
*  10,000 times more offended by the 17,000 dead kids and the 20,000 dead women, okay? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=522.5s)]
*  And if you're not, then you're saying, yeah, I don't care about Muslim lives. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=529.74s)]
*  I just care about, am I offended? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=533.2800000000001s)]
*  Okay, so let me offend you further, okay? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=535.1600000000001s)]
*  Now, and think about it. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=536.76s)]
*  If you're not biased in this issue, this is going to be blaringly and glaringly obvious, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=537.9200000000001s)]
*  okay? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=543.48s)]
*  Imagine if in the middle of the Holocaust, the Germans said, some of the Jewish prisoners [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=544.48s)]
*  are stealing the food. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=549.24s)]
*  They've come up with a little organized gang of Jews. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=550.6800000000001s)]
*  And that is why we're starving all the Jews to death. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=554.24s)]
*  Would anyone believe them? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=558.2s)]
*  I see, some Jews are stealing some of the food because you've got them in starvation [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=560.36s)]
*  concentration camps. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=566.68s)]
*  So that's why you're preventing all of the Jews from getting the food, so you starve [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=569.32s)]
*  all of them. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=573.72s)]
*  Well, no one would accept that ridiculous propaganda from the Nazis. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=574.72s)]
*  But that is literally what the Israelis are saying. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=579.96s)]
*  Some small group of Palestinians might be stealing some of the food. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=584.24s)]
*  That is why we're starving the entire population. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=590.76s)]
*  Well, you see, that's an obvious lie. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=594.12s)]
*  They're starving them on purpose because they have become what they most feared. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=597.5200000000001s)]
*  And one more thing for now, and I got more details in a sec. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=601.88s)]
*  But look, I'm so proud that I was the partner with Gideon Levy in the debate we did on Israel. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=605.84s)]
*  And what I really appreciate is, well, we already had tons of Jewish Americans speaking [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=612.0799999999999s)]
*  out against this genocide. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=615.76s)]
*  Now brave Israelis are coming out and going, no, no, this is not what we signed up for. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=617.8s)]
*  This is what we hate. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=623.3199999999999s)]
*  What are we doing? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=624.5999999999999s)]
*  This is insanity. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=625.5999999999999s)]
*  So thank you for speaking out and being a moral voice within Israel. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=626.68s)]
*  Last two things here, guys. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=631.1999999999999s)]
*  So number one, the reason Smoltrich wants to starve them is because he wants to push [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=634.56s)]
*  them into the Sinai desert in Egypt and take all of Gaza. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=640.12s)]
*  Again, not speculation. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=643.6800000000001s)]
*  He has said it. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=645.76s)]
*  He said we should take all of Gaza and they have voted to quote unquote conquer Gaza. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=646.76s)]
*  If he leaves the coalition Netanyahu is out. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=650.84s)]
*  I have heard rumors. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=652.88s)]
*  This is massive speculation and it comes from the right wing. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=654.86s)]
*  So take it with a boulder of salt that they're working on a two state solution peace deal. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=658.02s)]
*  I would be floored, floored by that. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=663.72s)]
*  The reason that I'm bringing that up as a possibility here is that Netanyahu soon will [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=666.8s)]
*  have to make a decision. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=672.04s)]
*  Am I going to keep that coalition government together with the right wing Nazis in his [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=673.56s)]
*  government like Smoltrich and Ben Gavir, like convicted terrorists and proud genociders? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=678.48s)]
*  Or am I gonna do a deal with Trump and the US and we're gonna lead to a ceasefire? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=686.4399999999999s)]
*  And I mean, again, two state solution seems unimaginable at this point. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=691.08s)]
*  But if they went in that direction and they ended all this, then he wouldn't need necessarily [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=695.7s)]
*  Smoltrich and Ben Gavir. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=700.1400000000001s)]
*  He might be able to make an alliance with other people in the Knesset. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=702.2800000000001s)]
*  Because the only thing that Netanyahu cares about is staying in power and of course murdering [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=705.58s)]
*  Palestinians, because he enjoys that and stealing their land. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=709.26s)]
*  He loves that. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=713.62s)]
*  That's been his lifelong mission. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=714.62s)]
*  But overall, he might think, hey, you know what, I stole enough land here. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=716.0200000000001s)]
*  I killed enough Palestinians here. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=719.46s)]
*  I'm gonna stay in power with this alliance rather than that alliance. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=721.1s)]
*  It's a tough, tough thing to believe. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=724.7s)]
*  It's a real stretch. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=727.46s)]
*  I'll only believe it after I see the deal. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=729.1400000000001s)]
*  But usually what will happen is they'll promise something like that. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=731.1800000000001s)]
*  And then they'll come back and go, yeah, two state solution where they continue to be occupied [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=733.98s)]
*  and we control both the Israeli side and the Palestinian side. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=737.7s)]
*  We're gonna call it a two state solution, but they live under permanent oppression and [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=741.82s)]
*  they serve us and we can kill them anytime we like. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=745.0600000000001s)]
*  That's usually how it goes. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=747.82s)]
*  But maybe there's a strand of hope there. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=750.26s)]
*  But for now, the starvation continues. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=752.5s)]
*  There will never be any hope unless the United States allows the international community [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=755.4200000000001s)]
*  to ensure that Israel follows through in allowing Palestinians to have their own state and an [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=759.74s)]
*  opportunity at self-determination. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=767.38s)]
*  But Israel will never never allow that. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=769.3000000000001s)]
*  And they've been clear about it. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=771.22s)]
*  So the US will always provide cover for Israel unless we change the way politics works in [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=772.3000000000001s)]
*  this country. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=778.34s)]
*  And I don't wanna give people false hope. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=779.7800000000001s)]
*  The problem is the cover that the United States provides for any and all wrongdoing carried [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=782.42s)]
*  off by the Israeli government. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=787.66s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below, an angel gets his wings. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=789.14s)]
*  Totally not true, but it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DU4G7o-jQg&t=792.0999999999999s)]
