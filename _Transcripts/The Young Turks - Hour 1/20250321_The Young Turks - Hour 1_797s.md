"President Donald Trump kicked off the process of dismantling the Department of Education by signing an executive order on Thursday.

The move aims to fulfill a longstanding campaign promise and shift more power over education to the states. While the president cannot completely shut down the agency without approval from Congress, the department announced earlier this month that nearly half its staff would leave through layoffs and voluntary buyouts."*

# UNBELIEVABLE Gutfeld Take on Federal Funds For Disabled Kids
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [March 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ)
*  When I hear Republicans out there talking about their plan for education in America, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=0.0s)]
*  I don't hear them talking about making sure disabled kids have access to a public education. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=4.08s)]
*  I don't hear them talking about impoverished. I know you are, thank you for admitting it in [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=8.8s)]
*  such a public forum. They want to end up privatizing it. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=13.44s)]
*  Yeah, that's gross. I mean, it's hardly out of the norm for the five. I mean, that one [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=17.12s)]
*  joke, I think it was Greg Gutfeld says he's a comedian. I think that's the cover story. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=23.36s)]
*  That's pretty much what he does. But like, it's true. You don't actually care. I didn't see a lot [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=28.32s)]
*  of other people at the table saying, yeah, Jessica, you've got a good point. Hey, Greg, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=34.88s)]
*  you're being unfair there. That's cruel. We pretend to be Christians. You're hurting our [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=39.2s)]
*  cover story. They didn't seem to have really any problem with that. And considering that [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=44.56s)]
*  Tarlov's comments come on the wake of Donald Trump killing the Department of Education, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=49.28s)]
*  which is a prelude to throwing more of the responsibility for education back to the states, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=54.24s)]
*  which some will be prepared to take up after a few incredibly difficult years of adaptation, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=58.88s)]
*  perhaps. But others have never cared about public education. They have no interest whatsoever in [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=65.2s)]
*  spending money on that or providing oversight. They know that. Donald Trump knows that. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=70.8s)]
*  The five knows that. But they are comforted by the fact that no matter what happens and no [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=75.44s)]
*  matter what state you live in, their kids will be able to go to the best schools in the country. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=80.08s)]
*  Their donors' kids will be able to go to amazing schools. Ivy League, indeed. They'll be fine. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=85.03999999999999s)]
*  Those kids don't need the protections and oversight of the Department of Education. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=91.12s)]
*  They're gonna be just fine. Your kids, maybe not so much. And so we have more that we're [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=95.92s)]
*  gonna talk about. But I wanna throw it to you as feel free if you want to engage with Gutfeld or [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=99.68s)]
*  just the fact that they're effectively trying to largely wind down the Department of Education. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=104.8s)]
*  What do you think about this? Yeah, yeah, you said it. Gutfeld, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=109.28s)]
*  he's a joker. He's a comedian. That's just what he does. We on the left, we don't know how to [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=113.04s)]
*  take a joke. But the thing is, we've learned that oftentimes when they're joking about things, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=118.0s)]
*  they're not joking. They mean everything that they're saying. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=124.16s)]
*  And the thing that they're joking about is something that is actively happening in this [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=126.64s)]
*  country right now. Donald Trump, another joker, he loves to make a joke. He is trying to dismantle [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=130.08s)]
*  and defund the Department of Education. If he gets his way, it will completely shrink to, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=136.16s)]
*  I mean, basically he's just gonna be there to manage student loans and Pell grants and [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=142.48s)]
*  that kind of thing. But you know what? They're finally sending education back to the states, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=146.07999999999998s)]
*  which is where I guess all of their supporters want education to be. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=150.4s)]
*  But the thing is, the majority of Americans do not support this move. We don't want to see [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=154.64s)]
*  the Department of Education gutted. Trump has already caught some backlash in his efforts to [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=159.92s)]
*  try to defund or dismantle the Department of Education because it's not so easy. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=166.48s)]
*  It can't be done with just an executive order. It has to go through legislation, through Congress, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=170.88s)]
*  and all of that because it is an executive level department. But he's trying and the fact that he's [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=175.67999999999998s)]
*  trying means that likely eventually he's going to get it done in some way, shape or form. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=181.92s)]
*  And it's very distressing because the states, I guess maybe it's better for smaller government, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=187.76s)]
*  bigger government, whatever. That's always gonna be an ongoing debate in this country. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=194.95999999999998s)]
*  But at the end of the day, if we're just kicking everything back to the states, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=198.88s)]
*  that's Donald Trump's explanation for everything that he does. For everything that he dismantles [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=202.32s)]
*  at the federal level, he's saying, no, we're giving it back to the states where it belongs. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=208.48s)]
*  What is the federal government gonna be left with? It's just gonna be our military, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=212.48s)]
*  unless we just have state run militias after this. I don't know. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=216.4s)]
*  Jordan. Yeah, I mean, what's the joke here? You can have an offensive joke that picks fun or makes [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=219.36s)]
*  fun of a marginalized group. I'm not saying it's funny or acceptable, but it has to be structured [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=229.84s)]
*  like a joke. And Greg Gutfeld is supposed to be what the comedic relief on the five, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=236.0s)]
*  but it seems like he just kind of sits there like this and then just says the most offensive [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=240.56s)]
*  thing he can possibly think of without any real structure or thought. It's just, wow, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=247.2s)]
*  he's shocking. He went there. And in this context, it's just malice. That's all it is. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=251.52s)]
*  There isn't a joke here. The punchline is that people who need help aren't going to get it, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=258.24s)]
*  and he's happy about it. The joke's on us, I guess, because these are people that we should [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=263.76s)]
*  take care of. They should have an equal opportunity or have some sort of infrastructure [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=269.52s)]
*  in the public education system to meet their needs. And just, no, I don't care. All right, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=275.2s)]
*  you're just a jerk. That's all it is. To Yaz's point, I think we might see pushback once people [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=280.56s)]
*  realize what it would look like without a Department of Education. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=289.35999999999996s)]
*  I don't think a lot of people are going to want this once they see the consequences. Sadly, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=292.64s)]
*  it might be too late. But especially on the right, everyone's wrapped up in this whole, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=296.64s)]
*  like, oh, they're doing DEI and cultural Marxism in our schools. And once they realize [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=302.4s)]
*  the eradication of the Department of Education and everything that comes along with it [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=308.8s)]
*  is more than just top-down policies on curriculum or how schools can't discriminate, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=313.12s)]
*  it's a lot of funding. It's a lot of individual needs being met through the government. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=319.28s)]
*  I think we're going to see this, and of course, in the Department of Education, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=326.32s)]
*  but as more and more agencies get heavily curtailed or completely eliminated, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=329.68s)]
*  people are going to maybe finally realize what the government does for them. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=334.88s)]
*  Sadly, I think it'll be too late. Yeah, I mean, look, if we want to jump into the [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=339.2s)]
*  former responsibilities of the Department of Education, there's a few categories. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=343.92s)]
*  So managing federal funding. So again, none of these conservative pundits or politicians [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=348.88s)]
*  need that funding. They're all wealthy. They'll be perfectly fine. Plenty of conservatives [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=356.32s)]
*  out there, the voters, MAGA voters, they need that funding. Their kids are going to suffer. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=361.6s)]
*  Their job prospects are going to be worse. Their life outlook is going to be worse. Maybe they'll [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=365.52s)]
*  see that. Maybe they won't. Enforcing civil rights law. Of course, the elite Republicans [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=369.76s)]
*  don't give a damn about that. And this would be politically bad for them if, for instance, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=375.2s)]
*  they in the last election were making a play to appeal to more black and brown voters. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=380.71999999999997s)]
*  But obviously, they weren't trying to do that. So utterly screwing over those students, I'm sure [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=384.4s)]
*  won't come back to bite them in the ass. Providing access for students with disabilities. I did [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=387.59999999999997s)]
*  Google it, and conservatives don't have kids with disabilities. So I guess they'll be fine [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=392.4s)]
*  in that respect. It shouldn't hurt them at all. And servicing more than $1 trillion worth of [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=397.12s)]
*  student loans, which they will continue doing. Because of course, that's something you take from [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=401.36s)]
*  students rather than give to students. So they're perfectly fine with that. I mean, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=405.6s)]
*  they're being super clear about what they think about America's kids, the next generation. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=409.84000000000003s)]
*  I will never understand how more young people weren't just enraged at the right, at the [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=415.6s)]
*  conservative, at the Republican Party for the rest of their lives. When over the last four years, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=421.84000000000003s)]
*  Joe Biden finally did for students, to some extent, what we routinely do for wealthy people, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=426.96s)]
*  canceling their debt, bailing them out. And he canceled a bunch of the debt. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=433.04s)]
*  And then Republicans around the country said, no, put it back on them. And they did that. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=437.04s)]
*  And tens of millions are screwed for decades. And lots of them are Republicans. It's not just [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=443.2s)]
*  Democrats to go to college. And I guess a bunch of them are like, that's okay. You just piled my [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=451.12s)]
*  future with a mountain of debt. But I do like your position on trans people. So I guess that's okay. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=456.16s)]
*  I'll never own a home. I'll never open a business. And I can never afford to move. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=461.92s)]
*  But I do like that somewhere there's a trans person I'll never meet that will never be able [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=465.44s)]
*  to play a sport they like. And by the way, that's what's driving most of their other talk about [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=469.28000000000003s)]
*  the funding for schools. Trump has already rejected hundreds of millions of dollars of funding for [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=474.96000000000004s)]
*  multiple universities because they allow trans people to play sports. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=480.24s)]
*  I mean, that is a level of identity politics and cancel culture that America has literally [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=484.71999999999997s)]
*  never seen before. And again, they're perfectly fine with that. And so, look, a bunch of these [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=489.28s)]
*  states are now saying that in low income areas, in rural areas, they're going to have to massively [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=495.68s)]
*  scale back the provision of education because they relied on that federal funding. And that is, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=502.4s)]
*  some of it might still exist. But one of the issues is that not only is this going to be screwing over [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=506.71999999999997s)]
*  all these states, but it's also as with everything else coming out of the Trump [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=511.12s)]
*  administration, it's super half-assed and vague and they have really no idea what this actually [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=514.16s)]
*  means. They don't know what funding is still going to exist. And sure, that's screwing over [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=519.6s)]
*  some blue states. But there's a lot of state legislatures in red states that have no idea [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=524.64s)]
*  what they're supposed to do about this because again, it's so vague. And so, this is going to [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=528.88s)]
*  have massively negative outcomes. But I also think it's one of the things and I'll toss it back to [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=534.08s)]
*  you guys where the right wrecks things. And then they use the fact that things are wrecked [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=540.08s)]
*  to argue for why you should put them in charge. So they are screwing over public education. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=547.5200000000001s)]
*  And in four years, they will use that as an excuse to just throw more money into private schools. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=553.36s)]
*  Rather than reforming the Department of Education, providing more funding, listening to teachers, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=559.76s)]
*  that sort of thing. They will instead use this as an excuse to put more funding into charter schools [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=564.5600000000001s)]
*  and that sort of thing. So I don't know, Jordan, I'll start with you. Where do you think we go from [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=569.36s)]
*  here? Yeah, you're seeing it across the board, John. Sean Duffy, who was the former commissioner [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=572.72s)]
*  of the Social Security Administration, used that same argument to talk about these Social Security [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=578.4s)]
*  cuts. They're going to go after the program, break it, and then turn back to voters and be like, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=582.72s)]
*  it's broken. How did this happen? I guess we just have to privatize it. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=589.6s)]
*  All of these, same thing with education. They want to privatize education. They want to [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=593.44s)]
*  establish a voucher system in charter schools because it allows people in their circles to get [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=599.12s)]
*  more and more wealthy. When you have people having to pay for education, then all of a sudden, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=604.32s)]
*  new crops of billionaires or current billionaires get even more wealthy. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=609.28s)]
*  That's what the DeVos family, the former secretary of education, stands to benefit tremendously [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=612.8s)]
*  if they're successful here. So that's what they're doing when they do this. They want to [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=619.52s)]
*  break something, go back to voters, say, it's broken, support us as we revamp the system. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=624.64s)]
*  And that revamped system is something that was taken care of by the government for you, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=630.72s)]
*  as imperfect as it may be, now is an additional charge for you. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=637.36s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, it's the same thing, but the postal service, healthcare, defense, education, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=641.76s)]
*  they want to get money and government programs that benefit millions and millions of people [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=649.84s)]
*  don't make billionaires bigger billionaires, right? One thing I will say about the Republicans [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=654.96s)]
*  is to your point, Sean, is that they know how to stick to a plan. They set on a strategy [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=660.64s)]
*  and they stick to it. They stay on message and they all get behind it, right? [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=665.84s)]
*  This demonization of education was such an easy cause for Republicans to take up because [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=669.84s)]
*  they already have the evangelical vote. And religious people, they love to send their kids [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=674.5600000000001s)]
*  to private religious schools or just to homeschool them. So they already have this base that doesn't [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=679.28s)]
*  trust the public education system. And on top of that, they have a lot of wealthy people who [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=684.9599999999999s)]
*  vote Republican and their kids go to private schools, maybe not religious ones, but they [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=689.4399999999999s)]
*  already don't trust the public school system. Here in Texas, Jordan kind of mentioned this, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=693.4399999999999s)]
*  our governor has been trying to push his corrupt school voucher program for years. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=698.3199999999999s)]
*  And it hasn't quite gained the support he needs yet, but he recently is, he started trying again, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=702.9599999999999s)]
*  and he brought up the long debunked myth that there are litter boxes in classrooms and saying [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=709.6s)]
*  that we have to go after the furries now. That is what the Texas government is doing. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=715.4399999999999s)]
*  It's so much fun living here, let me tell you. But on top of that, we have the issue with school [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=719.52s)]
*  shooters that they have done nothing about, right? It is literally, it's dangerous to send [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=724.88s)]
*  your children to public schools these days. And it's terrifying because you never know, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=729.1999999999999s)]
*  even if the odds are that your child won't get killed in a school shooting, the chance is still [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=733.12s)]
*  there and the chance they're not doing anything to mitigate it and they won't do anything to [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=738.64s)]
*  mitigate it, right? We're just gonna just keep having these same conversations over and over [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=743.04s)]
*  and over again for years, decades at this point, cuz they're not gonna do anything about it. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=747.12s)]
*  So yeah, John, to your point, they're gonna do this now and then four years from now, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=752.3199999999999s)]
*  say look how bad it is and use that as an excuse to gut it even further or completely dismantle it. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=756.64s)]
*  They've already done that, right? They've been doing that to where we got to this point. But [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=762.3199999999999s)]
*  as I mentioned, the majority of Americans do not support this move. But that's a president that we [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=766.96s)]
*  have, he doesn't care. Once he's in office, he's gonna do whatever he wants. Yeah, and they might [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=773.44s)]
*  lose the midterms, they might lose the next presidential election. But at that point, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=777.6800000000001s)]
*  they'll already have done tons of damage to the government, the entirety of it. And they'll have [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=780.48s)]
*  handed over trillions of dollars to the wealthiest people in the country and you can't immediately [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=784.48s)]
*  take that back. They know that. Every time you ring the bell below, an angel gets his swings. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=787.9200000000001s)]
*  Totally not true, but it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwqX0CI7dDQ&t=793.12s)]
