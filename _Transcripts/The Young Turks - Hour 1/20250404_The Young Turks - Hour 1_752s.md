TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

# Judge ORDERS Trump Admin To Return Deported Man
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [April 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8)
*  federal judge in Maryland has [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=0.0s)]
*  granted a preliminary injunction. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=1.62s)]
*  And perhaps more importantly, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=3.8200000000000003s)]
*  ordered the government to facilitate [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=5.66s)]
*  the return of a Maryland man who [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=7.82s)]
*  was deported to El Salvador in error. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=9.52s)]
*  As the government admitted he [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=12.0s)]
*  should not have been deported, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=13.68s)]
*  it was a mistake. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=15.36s)]
*  They sent him to that notorious [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=16.580000000000002s)]
*  prison that Christina did her [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=18.3s)]
*  little Rolex photo shoot in front [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=19.82s)]
*  of. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=21.66s)]
*  And then they said, oops, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=22.16s)]
*  we're not going to do anything [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=23.740000000000002s)]
*  about it, we're not going to bring [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  him back. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=27.2s)]
*  Well, according to the judge, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=27.76s)]
*  And I love the way the judge chose [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=29.98s)]
*  to announce this saying, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=31.78s)]
*  I am going to grant the motion for [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=33.1s)]
*  preliminary injunction I've [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=34.800000000000004s)]
*  reviewed, and I'll read this word [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=36.6s)]
*  for word so that there is no dispute [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=38.56s)]
*  that the oral order is [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=40.54s)]
*  the written order. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=41.900000000000006s)]
*  Obviously referencing the little [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=43.540000000000006s)]
*  game that the Trump administration [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=45.18s)]
*  was playing just a week or two ago [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=46.92s)]
*  where they pretended, I didn't hear [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=48.620000000000005s)]
*  you in time to stop deporting [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=50.58s)]
*  people because they didn't want to [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=52.14s)]
*  comply with what the judge was [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=54.06s)]
*  saying. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=55.74s)]
*  But maybe more importantly for [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=56.28s)]
*  the individual, the judge says [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=58.3s)]
*  the two defendants are hereby [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=60.199999999999996s)]
*  ordered to facilitate the return [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=61.879999999999995s)]
*  of plaintiff Kilmar Garcia to [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=63.86s)]
*  the United States by no later than [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=65.62s)]
*  1159 PM on Monday, April 7th. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=67.6s)]
*  So that is coming up at the end of [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=69.72s)]
*  this coming Monday. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=71.82s)]
*  It's just a few days from now [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=73.3s)]
*  saying you have to go and [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=75.22s)]
*  get him and bring him back. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=76.94s)]
*  And importantly up until this [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=78.78s)]
*  point, the Trump administration has [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=80.53999999999999s)]
*  sort of uncharacteristically [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=82.74s)]
*  presented themselves as, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=84.7s)]
*  what are you going to do? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=86.4s)]
*  Or over El Salvador? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=88.25999999999999s)]
*  We have no leverage. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=89.42s)]
*  We don't have a $6 million deal [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=90.74s)]
*  with them. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=92.58s)]
*  We can't get there. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=93.46s)]
*  We can't save him. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=94.5s)]
*  I know Kristi Noem can don't go and [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=95.61999999999999s)]
*  do her little cosplay photo shoots, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=97.3s)]
*  but they can throw us out of there [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=99.06s)]
*  anytime they want to. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=100.53999999999999s)]
*  There's nothing we can do to get [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=101.53999999999999s)]
*  these guys back, pretending that [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=103.02s)]
*  they are utterly weak and impotent. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=104.62s)]
*  Well, according to the judge, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=106.42s)]
*  that's not good enough. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=107.74s)]
*  And the judge pointed out that they [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=109.14s)]
*  have previously talked about having [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=110.89999999999999s)]
*  this deal with El Salvador for [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=112.78s)]
*  $6 million to house individuals. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=114.53999999999999s)]
*  That's a contract you have. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=117.34s)]
*  You have an ongoing business [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=118.38s)]
*  relationship with their prison [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=119.82s)]
*  system. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=121.46s)]
*  Clearly you can work something out. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=122.34s)]
*  Now, the lawyers for the DOJ are [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=124.42s)]
*  like, no, we don't have a contract. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=126.7s)]
*  And the judge pointed out that both [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=130.14s)]
*  Marco Rubio and [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=131.74s)]
*  Kristi Noem have spoken about [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=132.5s)]
*  this agreement. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=134.01999999999998s)]
*  They've mentioned the $6 million. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=135.01999999999998s)]
*  And so the judge says they may not [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=137.01999999999998s)]
*  have used the word contract, but [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=138.66s)]
*  agreement sounds a lot like [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=140.38s)]
*  contract when we paid $6 million. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=141.9s)]
*  I think I can draw a logical [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=144.18s)]
*  inference. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=146.14s)]
*  And so that kind of puts us at [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=147.29999999999998s)]
*  maybe an impasse where they're [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=148.9s)]
*  being ordered to do this thing. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=150.66s)]
*  They've previously said they're not [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=152.22s)]
*  going to do that. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=153.85999999999999s)]
*  Obviously they can do if they want [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=154.57999999999998s)]
*  to, they just don't want to admit [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=156.14s)]
*  that they got this wrong. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=157.7s)]
*  They don't want to reverse [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=159.1s)]
*  a deportation, and they don't have [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=160.22s)]
*  much time until it happens. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=161.82s)]
*  And so perhaps that big [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=163.26s)]
*  constitutional crisis between [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=164.5s)]
*  the executive branch and [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=166.12s)]
*  the judiciary, which we've already [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=167.42s)]
*  seen examples of already. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=169.22s)]
*  This perhaps would be the biggest [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=170.7s)]
*  one if they just blow past that [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=172.22s)]
*  deadline and just say, hey, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=173.66s)]
*  what are you going to do about it? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=175.06s)]
*  Yeah, here's an idea. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=176.66s)]
*  If we can't get people back from [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=177.9s)]
*  El Salvador, we shouldn't send [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=179.22s)]
*  people to El Salvador. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=180.78s)]
*  Because what if we send [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=182.74s)]
*  the wrong person? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=183.54s)]
*  Yeah, we already did. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=184.74s)]
*  So if you say we have no ability to [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=186.34s)]
*  get an innocent man back and [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=188.5s)]
*  the Trump administration admits [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=190.26s)]
*  that he's innocent, then why are [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=192.42000000000002s)]
*  you sending them there? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=194.78s)]
*  What if you do it again and [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=197.54s)]
*  again and again? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=198.58s)]
*  So by definition, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=200.14000000000001s)]
*  you should end that program. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=201.14000000000001s)]
*  But they say, no, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=203.1s)]
*  I don't want to end the program. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=203.9s)]
*  And yes, I sent an innocent man, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=205.46s)]
*  but so what? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=207.54000000000002s)]
*  It's like the worst dungeon in [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=209.22000000000003s)]
*  the world and [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=210.54000000000002s)]
*  he'll very likely get tortured [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=211.18s)]
*  there. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=212.62s)]
*  And by the way, he was trying to [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=213.12s)]
*  escape from gangs in El Salvador. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=214.38000000000002s)]
*  Who do you think is in that prison? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=216.18s)]
*  It's literally filled to the rim [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=218.38000000000002s)]
*  with gangs from El Salvador. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=220.02s)]
*  So that guy's life is in grave [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=222.46s)]
*  danger. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=224.54000000000002s)]
*  So the Trump administration says [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=225.5s)]
*  two unbelievable things here. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=227.46s)]
*  One is, yeah, we made a mistake and [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=229.14000000000001s)]
*  we sent the guy over. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=231.5s)]
*  And yeah, he might die, but so [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=233.46s)]
*  what? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=235.3s)]
*  We're going to do it again and [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=236.86s)]
*  we're not going to get him out. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=238.06s)]
*  Look, this is why I changed on [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=242.14000000000001s)]
*  the death penalty. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=243.70000000000002s)]
*  It's one thing to say, you look, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=244.94s)]
*  man, I don't care about this or [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=246.54000000000002s)]
*  that, I believe in justice or [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=248.10000000000002s)]
*  vengeance or whatever. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=249.78s)]
*  If they killed my family members, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=252.18s)]
*  I want them executed. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=253.62s)]
*  It's another thing to say, yeah, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=255.02s)]
*  I know he's innocent, I don't care. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=256.74s)]
*  I'm in favor of the death penalty, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=258.5s)]
*  I want him executed. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=259.78000000000003s)]
*  Why? Why would you want innocent [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=261.66s)]
*  people executed? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=262.82s)]
*  That's crazy, right? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=263.5s)]
*  So if you're in the right wing and [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=265.18s)]
*  you're like, your dad is Donald [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=267.34s)]
*  Trump, formally or informally, and [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=269.26s)]
*  you're like, no, no, no. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=271.58s)]
*  If we send innocent people to a [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=273.34s)]
*  hellhole in El Salvador and [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=275.38s)]
*  we can't get them back, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=277.26s)]
*  that's the mercantile. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=278.86s)]
*  No, it isn't. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=280.46s)]
*  No, it isn't. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=281.18s)]
*  It just isn't, okay? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=282.3s)]
*  Then you're not in favor of our [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=283.78s)]
*  principles and our constitution and [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=285.18s)]
*  the way we do things. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=286.78s)]
*  Second outrageous thing is, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=287.7s)]
*  I want to read it to you from ABC [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=289.3s)]
*  News. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=290.94s)]
*  So this guy, Ruveni, is the lawyer [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=291.70000000000005s)]
*  here for the government, okay? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=293.94s)]
*  By the way, he says they're totally [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=296.06s)]
*  innocent and so by all but [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=297.90000000000003s)]
*  God's you, we can't get it back. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=299.3s)]
*  You ask Caroline Levitt, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=301.42s)]
*  Caroline Levitt's like, no, no, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=302.54s)]
*  he's a leader of MS-13. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=304.38000000000005s)]
*  But you're in court saying he's not [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=307.78000000000003s)]
*  even in MS-13. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=309.90000000000003s)]
*  Yes, the evidence indicates we got [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=311.5s)]
*  it 100% wrong, but [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=313.58000000000004s)]
*  they don't care about reality, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=314.70000000000005s)]
*  they don't care about truth. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=316.66s)]
*  And so I get super mad at Democrats [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=318.22s)]
*  who lie, among the few apparently, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=320.66s)]
*  okay? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=323.66s)]
*  But on the right, I think there's [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=325.18s)]
*  a little bit of a rebellion brewing [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=327.38000000000005s)]
*  but there has to be a much bigger [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=329.66s)]
*  rebellion because the old media, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=331.70000000000005s)]
*  the Fox News, the ones that are in [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=333.78000000000003s)]
*  the tank 100% for Donald Trump, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=335.86s)]
*  they're never going to turn around, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=337.78000000000003s)]
*  right? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=339.78000000000003s)]
*  And they're just going to keep [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=340.3s)]
*  repeating the lies. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=341.70000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, he's not an MS-13 and [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=342.74s)]
*  he's a leader of MS-13. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=344.54s)]
*  I mean, they just said on Fox News, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=345.98s)]
*  the stock market is dead, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=348.38s)]
*  is down, but down means up. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=350.46s)]
*  So they can keep saying this. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=352.54s)]
*  Anyway, Rubeni's the lawyer, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=354.38s)]
*  he already admitted that the guy's [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=355.78000000000003s)]
*  not an MS-13. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=357.34s)]
*  When asked by Judge Zinnis under [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=358.06s)]
*  what authority law enforcement [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=359.82s)]
*  officers seized Abrego Garcia, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=361.5s)]
*  Rubeni said he was frustrated that [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=363.38s)]
*  he did not have those answers. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=365.5s)]
*  You went to court as a government [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=370.7s)]
*  attorney saying, we will not get [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=372.7s)]
*  him back, Your Honor, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=374.86s)]
*  we should not have to do that. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=376.14s)]
*  Okay, what authority did you have [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=378.42s)]
*  to send him there? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=380.02s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=381.06s)]

*  Rubeni himself says, Your Honor, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=387.94s)]
*  my answer to a lot of these [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=389.9s)]
*  questions is going to be [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=391.26s)]

*  say that we're not in a [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=466.40000000000003s)]
*  constitutional crisis. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=467.02000000000004s)]
*  We're on the edge of one, but [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=467.9s)]
*  at what point is crisis declared? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=469.28s)]
*  But this is sparking a very, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=471.29999999999995s)]
*  very concerning debate in [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=472.78s)]
*  this country. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=474.21999999999997s)]
*  Whether or not people, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=475.06s)]
*  American citizens or not, have a [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=476.29999999999995s)]
*  right to due process in this [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=478.14s)]

*  that we have in this country. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=481.73999999999995s)]
*  Now the people who are supportive [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=483.29999999999995s)]
*  of Trump's deportations, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=485.21999999999997s)]
*  they keep excusing all of it by [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=486.82s)]
*  saying that terrorists and [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=488.5s)]
*  gang members deserve to be swiftly [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=490.15999999999997s)]
*  punished. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=492.06s)]
*  They shouldn't have been here in [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=493.09999999999997s)]
*  the first place and they need to be [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=494.29999999999995s)]
*  removed from this country [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=495.7s)]
*  immediately. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=496.94s)]
*  Not only that, but [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=497.86s)]
*  the situation is so dire that [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=498.86s)]
*  there simply is no time for [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=500.38s)]
*  court proceedings. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=501.86s)]
*  We have to get them out as soon as [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=502.98s)]
*  possible right now. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=504.66s)]
*  The very obvious problem with this [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=506.54s)]
*  argument is that you can't know [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=508.58s)]
*  that these people are terrorists or [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=510.42s)]
*  gang members until they have due [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=512.46s)]
*  process, right? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=514.3s)]
*  You can't just assume that they are [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=515.34s)]
*  what you say they are and then [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=517.18s)]
*  throw them in a Salvadorian prison. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=518.62s)]
*  But Republicans and [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=520.54s)]
*  even Democrats to an extent, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=521.5s)]
*  they have been playing this game [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=523.1s)]
*  for a very long time. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=524.82s)]
*  They know that if you just call [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=526.06s)]
*  someone a terrorist or a gang [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=527.66s)]
*  member, the public will forgive you [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=529.1199999999999s)]
*  for treating them completely [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=531.02s)]
*  inhumanely and for denying them [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=532.5s)]
*  rights that we have built our [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=534.2199999999999s)]
*  entire nation off of. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=535.7399999999999s)]
*  The fear mongering, it just takes [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=537.4599999999999s)]
*  advantage of general ignorance. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=539.3s)]
*  But it's like the point that I was [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=541.8199999999999s)]
*  making earlier in another story. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=543.14s)]
*  Trump likes to plant these seeds [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=544.78s)]
*  with his base so that when he does [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=546.3399999999999s)]
*  crazy things, when he does illegal [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=547.9s)]
*  and unconstitutional things, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=549.6999999999999s)]
*  they don't even battle lash. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=551.3399999999999s)]
*  They just say, yeah, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=553.02s)]
*  I did say that gangs were a problem. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=554.3399999999999s)]
*  I guess these are the gangs. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=556.26s)]
*  I guess Trump is finally doing [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=557.42s)]
*  something about them. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=558.74s)]
*  Thanks, Trump. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=559.6999999999999s)]
*  But he makes up these problems or [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=560.62s)]
*  he at least exaggerates the [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=562.54s)]
*  severity and the scope of existing [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=564.0999999999999s)]
*  problems. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=566.06s)]
*  And he doesn't provide any kind of [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=566.9s)]
*  evidence to support the claims that [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=568.66s)]
*  he makes because he knows he [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=570.54s)]
*  doesn't need to because his base [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=571.9s)]
*  never asked for evidence. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=573.62s)]
*  And then he pretends to solve [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=575.0999999999999s)]
*  these problems that he has largely [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=576.54s)]
*  made up so that his base will [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=578.28s)]
*  continue to support him. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=579.66s)]
*  And just to be clear, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=581.18s)]
*  I'm not saying that gangs aren't [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=582.02s)]
*  a problem in this country. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=583.38s)]
*  I'm saying the situation is not so [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=584.3s)]
*  acute and so dire that it requires [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=586.46s)]
*  that we suspend our justice system [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=588.6s)]
*  in this country just to exterminate [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=590.78s)]
*  them. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=593.1s)]
*  That is not an excuse for [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=593.62s)]
*  us to be less than who we say we [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=595.06s)]
*  are. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=596.74s)]
*  Yeah, last two things for me. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=597.26s)]
*  If you're a right winger and [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=599.18s)]
*  you wanted to get those criminal [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=600.42s)]
*  gangs out of the country, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=601.9399999999999s)]
*  this hurts your cause. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=603.22s)]
*  If he had just done that and [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=604.46s)]
*  not send anybody innocent, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=605.78s)]
*  if he'd actually done a tiny bit of [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=607.22s)]
*  due diligence and due process, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=608.94s)]
*  hey, are they actually gang [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=610.62s)]
*  members? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=612.18s)]
*  If you get them out super popular, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=612.74s)]
*  then your position in the right [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=614.86s)]
*  wing would be super popular. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=616.66s)]
*  Now you've got Rogan, Coulter, and [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=618.7s)]
*  18 other people flipping on you, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=620.98s)]
*  and your position is becoming [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=623.14s)]
*  unpopular because you did it in [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=624.98s)]
*  an illegal and unconstitutional way. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=626.94s)]
*  How does that help your cause? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=629.3s)]
*  How does that help your cause? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=631.46s)]
*  Okay, and lastly, to answer [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=633.26s)]
*  Yaz's question, when do we know [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=635.0600000000001s)]
*  we're in a constitutional crisis? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=636.94s)]
*  So Trump is constantly doing these [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=638.82s)]
*  trial balloons, breaking a law here, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=641.14s)]
*  doing something unconstitutional [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=643.38s)]
*  there, something illegal there, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=645.22s)]
*  something that Congress has [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=647.22s)]
*  authority he doesn't, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=648.7s)]
*  he'll break it, etc. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=649.94s)]
*  You're in a constitutional crisis [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=651.58s)]
*  when the courts tell him, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=653.3000000000001s)]
*  don't stop doing that. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=654.66s)]
*  This is illegal or [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=656.22s)]
*  unconstitutional, and [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=657.22s)]
*  they don't listen. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=658.5400000000001s)]
*  So that's when we're totally [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=659.74s)]
*  screwed because the executive [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=661.26s)]
*  branch has all the weapons. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=662.86s)]
*  So the Supreme Court and [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=664.26s)]
*  all the courts are only as good as [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=665.6600000000001s)]
*  their word. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=667.58s)]
*  So if they say something, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=668.9s)]
*  we're all supposed to follow it, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=670.18s)]
*  that's in our constitution. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=671.62s)]
*  But if the executive branch goes, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=673.26s)]
*  I don't care about the constitution [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=674.74s)]
*  and I don't care about [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=676.22s)]
*  the three branches. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=677.02s)]
*  I'm just going to keep [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=678.38s)]
*  bringing the law and you can't make [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=678.9399999999999s)]
*  me because I have the guns. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=680.86s)]
*  Then we're screwed, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=682.5s)]
*  then we're in a constitutional [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=683.34s)]
*  crisis. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=684.46s)]
*  So far they've tested the waters [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=685.22s)]
*  a little bit. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=686.8199999999999s)]
*  They're like, the judge told us to [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=687.74s)]
*  turn around the plane, we won't. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=689.3s)]
*  The judge told us to bring someone [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=691.3s)]
*  back. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=692.9399999999999s)]
*  It was an oral order and [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=693.5s)]
*  not a written order. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=694.8199999999999s)]
*  That's why this judge was like, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=696.3s)]
*  it was oral and written. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=698.3s)]
*  So do not miss her. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=700.18s)]
*  And every time they did that, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=700.9399999999999s)]
*  they walked it back. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=702.38s)]
*  If they don't walk it back and [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=704.22s)]
*  they just go, that's it, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=705.74s)]
*  we're not listening to the courts. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=707.02s)]
*  Then we have absolute chaos here. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=709.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=712.34s)]
*  And I don't know what happens then [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=712.86s)]
*  because that's an epic disaster. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=714.66s)]
*  And I don't think it's a [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=717.06s)]
*  coincidence that they are sort of [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=718.1s)]
*  pushing us, propelling us towards [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=719.7s)]
*  that on this topic. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=721.58s)]
*  Where it's about a migrant, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=723.86s)]
*  it's about a migrant that some [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=725.3s)]
*  people believe Carolyn Leavitt's [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=726.7s)]
*  story of MS-13 human trafficking or [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=728.22s)]
*  whatever. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=730.02s)]
*  Because they want to tell [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=730.82s)]
*  the judge to kick rocks. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=732.3000000000001s)]
*  And they want a bunch of their base [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=734.9s)]
*  to be like, that's about migration. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=736.46s)]
*  Yeah, I'll go with him, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=738.22s)]
*  screw the courts, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=739.5s)]
*  they don't matter anymore. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=740.4200000000001s)]
*  And I think that's strategically [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=741.46s)]
*  why they're doing it in this area. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=742.78s)]
*  That's what I'm mostly [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=744.0600000000001s)]
*  worried about. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=745.02s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=745.86s)]
*  an angel gets his swings. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=747.4200000000001s)]
*  Totally not true, but it does keep [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs-SYopof8&t=748.94s)]
