TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.
The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.
On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.
Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.
Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.
TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful.

We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

# AOC TORCHES Establishment Dems
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM)
*  Let's go, Mom Donnie, let's go. And I definitely can live with someone beating Andrew Cuomo, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=0.0s)]
*  who has a very long track record in New York, it's true, of complete corruption. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=5.12s)]
*  There isn't a donor that he hasn't pleasured in the state of New York. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=9.84s)]
*  You know, we have so many incredible candidates. And yet, looking at all of them, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=12.96s)]
*  they still decided to throw all of their weight behind Andrew Cuomo. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=22.8s)]
*  The message that they send and what the political establishment sends to so many people is that it [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=29.36s)]
*  does not matter your positions, your content, your ideas, how experienced you are. It doesn't [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=35.36s)]
*  matter how much you work with them. They will still choose their old friends and an old generation [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  every single time. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=49.68s)]
*  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez called out the Democrats for shutting down people outside the party [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=52.0s)]
*  establishment while campaigning for Zoran Mom Donnie in New York over the weekend. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=60.32s)]
*  She was condemning Democratic leadership for backing Andrew Cuomo, despite the credible [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=65.76s)]
*  accusations of sexual assault against him and his history of corruption. Before we get to the latest [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=70.48s)]
*  on the New York mayoral race, Cenk, initial thoughts on what AOC said? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=76.0s)]
*  Cenk Cronin Yeah, so times are changing. AOC is changing. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=81.28s)]
*  You guys have seen me say it publicly. I've said it privately. I've said it everywhere I can. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=85.84s)]
*  Corporate Democrats are not your friends. They're not your colleagues. Establishment Democrats are [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=91.6s)]
*  not going to look out for you. All that colleague talk is garbage, meant to trick progressives and [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=97.92s)]
*  populists into not fighting back. And you guys saw me say on the show, what, hundreds of times, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=105.04s)]
*  maybe thousands of times. The minute they get a chance, they're gonna put a knife in your back, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=112.56s)]
*  and they're gonna try to eliminate every progressive from Congress. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=117.92s)]
*  If you weren't sure about that, go ask Cori Bush, Jamal Bowman, Marie Newman, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=120.88000000000001s)]
*  all Justice Democrats who are betrayed by their so-called colleagues. They're not your friends [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=125.84s)]
*  at all. Their job is to get more corrupt Democrats elected. They are your political opponents. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=132.72s)]
*  Wake up, okay? None of them are on your side. So unfortunately, it took AOC a long time to wake up, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=140.24s)]
*  but I love that speech. Good, good. I'll always take yes for an answer. I hope she keeps it going, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=146.64s)]
*  and I hope soon she begins to name names. Because a lot of times, Bernie and AOC, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=152.8s)]
*  while they're going in the right direction and beautiful, I love it. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=158.0s)]
*  Well, they're water's edge is names. Well, I mean, our colleagues, but shh. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=161.04s)]
*  Meanwhile, do they spare anyone? No, Mom, Johnny, terrible. Yeah, they're all fall. Andrew Cuomo. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=166.95999999999998s)]
*  No, Cuomo's corruption defined. Let's get to that story. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=174.48s)]
*  Yeah, as we approach the June 24th primary, the polls are getting narrower and narrower. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=178.72s)]
*  Most still show Cuomo winning, but a few days ago, a poll found that Mom, Donnie was in the lead for [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=186.4s)]
*  the first time. The survey conducted by public policy polling for Democrat Justin Brannon's [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=192.56s)]
*  city controller campaign found Mom, Donnie beating Cuomo 35% to 31%, a difference that is narrowly [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=198.0s)]
*  within the 4.1% margin of error. And with a tightening race has come more attacks on Zoran. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=205.6s)]
*  The Atlantic published a piece titled New York is not a democracy could ranked choice voting help [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=213.04s)]
*  Zoran Mom, Donnie beat Andrew Cuomo. In it, author Annie Lowry makes this insane comparison. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=220.56s)]
*  One thing the candidates share, I suppose, is that both get accused of being nepo babies. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=229.6s)]
*  Donnie's mother made the 1991 indie romance, Mississippi masala. Cuomo's father [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=236.56s)]
*  was governor of New York. Yeah, those are the same. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=244.24s)]
*  And today- That was just funny. I mean, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=248.4s)]
*  just ridiculous. And his dad might have been a teacher. You're saying he's not a nepo baby? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=254.72s)]
*  The other one, I mean, the poor guy, his dad was governor. I mean, and he was also governor. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=260.96s)]
*  And it just kind of fell on his lap. But you see the real problem is Mom, Donnie and his movie maker [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=266.08s)]
*  mother. Yeah, it's so desperate. We knew the attacks were going to increase and there's [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=272.79999999999995s)]
*  many more. We're gonna get into one of the funniest heel turns. This is from the New York Times. Now, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=280.47999999999996s)]
*  they had previously said they weren't going to do any more political endorsements. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=287.92s)]
*  But today, they published a piece with their quote advice to New Yorkers voting in the [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=292.24s)]
*  mayoral race. And you won't be surprised to hear that they're no fans of Zoran. First, they write, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=299.2s)]
*  11 candidates are competing for the Democratic nomination and many New Yorkers are understandably [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=305.92s)]
*  disappointed by the field. It lacks any candidate who seems likely to be the city's next great mayor. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=310.88s)]
*  For that reason, we are not endorsing a candidate. Unfortunately, Mr. Mom Donnie is running on an [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=316.88s)]
*  agenda uniquely unsuited to the city's challenges. He is a democratic socialist who too often ignores [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=323.04s)]
*  the unavoidable trade offs of governance. He favors rent freezes that could restrict housing [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=330.0s)]
*  supply and make it harder for younger New Yorkers and new arrivals to afford housing. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=335.92s)]
*  He wants the government to operate grocery stores as if customer service and retail sales [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=341.52s)]
*  were strengths of the public sector. He minimizes the importance of policing. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=347.28s)]
*  They also claimed Mondani would also bring less relevant experience than perhaps any mayor [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=353.28s)]
*  in New York history while arguing that Mr. Cuomo has the strongest policy record of the candidates. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=360.24s)]
*  We do not believe that Mr. Mom Donnie deserves a spot on New Yorkers ballots. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=367.28s)]
*  His experience is too thin and his agenda reads like a turbocharged version of Mr. de Blasio's [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=371.35999999999996s)]
*  dismaying mayorality. As for Mr. Cuomo, we have serious objections to his ethics and conduct, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=377.67999999999995s)]
*  even if he would be better for New York's future than Mr. Mom Donnie. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=385.52s)]
*  The no experience attack is one that Andrew Cuomo hit Mom Donnie with at the debate. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=390.64s)]
*  And here's how Zoran immediately hit back. Take a look. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=396.64s)]
*  Experience matters. And I think inexperience is dangerous in this case. Mr. Mom Donnie has [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=400.15999999999997s)]
*  had a staff of five people. You're not gonna run a staff of 300,000 employees. To put a person [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=408.24s)]
*  in this seat at this time with no experience is reckless and dangerous. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=415.76s)]
*  Mr. Cuomo, I have never had to resign in disgrace. I have never cut Medicaid. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=423.6s)]
*  I have never stolen hundreds of millions of dollars from the MTA. I have never hounded the [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=428.96000000000004s)]
*  13 women who credibly accused me of sexual harassment. I have never sued for their [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=433.44s)]
*  gynecological records. And I have never done those things because I am not you, Mr. Cuomo. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=438.16s)]
*  And furthermore, the name is Mom Donnie, M-A-M-D-A-N-I. You should learn how to say it. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=443.20000000000005s)]
*  Learn how to say it cuz there's a good chance he could be the next mayor. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=450.08s)]
*  What a closing line on that. What do you think, Cenk? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=456.71999999999997s)]
*  Damn, that's what I think. Okay, so look, some of the polls still have Cuomo with a good size lead, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=459.35999999999996s)]
*  but you can sense the panic in the air from the Cuomo team. And it's not just the Cuomo team. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=467.76s)]
*  Well, all right, I should rephrase that. It is the Cuomo team. But when I say the Cuomo team, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=473.44s)]
*  I mean all of mainstream media and all of the establishment Democrats. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=477.52s)]
*  There's this Mom Donnie guy. He's trouble. He's Cuomo, Cuomo. He's so good to the sponsors and [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=482.56s)]
*  the donors and the campaign. We gotta have his experience. We love his experience in corruption. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=489.91999999999996s)]
*  We gotta have it. I love the smell of panic in the morning. And by the way, this is coming from a guy [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=496.0s)]
*  who doesn't actually agree with all of Mom Donnie's policies. I think housing prices are totally out of [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=501.03999999999996s)]
*  control. I think there's a lot you could do in New York. I don't think rent freeze is the right way [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=506.56s)]
*  to go. Okay, but is that why they're all in a panic? I don't think so at all. Okay, that New York [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=511.12s)]
*  Times editorial, they're like, we are not endorsing anyone. But Cuomo has a great record. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=516.96s)]
*  Cuomo's fantastic. Mom Donnie, with all of his terrible policies and no experience at all. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=524.32s)]
*  I mean, they did all but spit on him, right? Now, do you want me to show you why I think [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=532.8s)]
*  they have an issue with Mom Donnie? Yeah, I'll say it. Well, I'll show you. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=537.28s)]
*  Let's go to the next clip from another debate that they had. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=542.0799999999999s)]
*  First visit, I would visit the Holy Land. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=546.24s)]
*  And Cuomo? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=548.56s)]
*  Given the hostility and the anti-Semitism that has been [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=549.4399999999999s)]
*  shown in New York, I would go to Israel. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=553.1999999999999s)]
*  Mr. Tilson, where would you go? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=556.24s)]
*  Yeah, I'd make my fourth trip to Israel followed by my fifth trip to Ukraine. Two of our greatest [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=557.4399999999999s)]
*  allies fighting on the front lines of the global war on terror. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=562.32s)]
*  Mr. Mom Donnie? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=566.72s)]
*  I would stay in New York City. My plans are to address New Yorkers across the five boroughs [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=568.1600000000001s)]
*  and focus on that. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=572.6400000000001s)]
*  You know, they asked the follow-up. They're like, are you saying you wouldn't go to Israel? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=575.7600000000001s)]
*  How dare you? Are you guys serious? The reporters seem, the moderators of that debate seem [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=581.2800000000001s)]
*  genuinely outraged. He's running for the mayor of New York, not of Tel Aviv. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=587.76s)]
*  So, and then after he gives that answer, and yes, he is Muslim. All of a sudden, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=595.12s)]
*  all of mainstream media and New York Times is like, Mom Donnie, how dare he? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=603.2s)]
*  Well, okay, maybe I can live with the Renfriess. Let's go, Mom Donnie. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=610.24s)]
*  Let's go. And I definitely can live with someone beating Andrew Cuomo, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=613.84s)]
*  who has a very long track record in New York, it's true, of complete corruption. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=617.76s)]
*  There isn't a donor that he hasn't pleasured in the state of New York. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=623.2800000000001s)]
*  Well, yeah, of course, this question about where would you go and what, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=628.5600000000001s)]
*  basically they're leading. You have to say Israel for this because it's a, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=632.8000000000001s)]
*  you know, center right, even to some extent center left position, you have to do it. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=636.8000000000001s)]
*  I think his answer is right. Yeah, I'm running for mayor, not Congress, not president. I'm not [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=642.24s)]
*  working on international affairs here. I'm running for mayor of a massive city. That's what I'm gonna [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=648.32s)]
*  focus on. Great answer, smart answer, and they couldn't handle it. But I also wanna clarify [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=653.6s)]
*  some things. The Times was misleading with the rent freeze. That is for people who live in rent [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=657.76s)]
*  stabilized apartments, and there are many. And many of them, that's the only way they can stay [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=665.6800000000001s)]
*  in the city. So to prevent them from being priced out, greedy developers and corporate landlords [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=671.52s)]
*  want to raise those rents. He's gonna fight for them. This is the working people, the working class, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=677.1999999999999s)]
*  or maybe in some cases, the working poor in New York. It's the only way they can stay in the city. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=683.28s)]
*  Yes, I love that policy. He also does support new housing and new affordable housing. So it's not [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=687.4399999999999s)]
*  just going to be, it's not going to prevent new people from coming in. It's going to help lower [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=694.3199999999999s)]
*  prices overall. I think it's a smart policy. So I do wanna dispel that myth that the New York Times [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=699.2s)]
*  is pushing likely at the behest of the Cuomo campaign, because that's not entirely accurate. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=704.5600000000001s)]
*  But across the board, it seems like he's got a great set of policies that are [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=710.24s)]
*  putting people first. I hope he gets elected. I mean, obviously it wouldn't affect me. I don't [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=714.1600000000001s)]
*  live there, but I see a lot of people who I do care about, who are hard workers, who sometimes [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=720.1600000000001s)]
*  struggle to make ends meet. They seem enthused by him. They seem excited at the prospect of [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=725.76s)]
*  him coming in and hopefully enacting some of these policies. If he's elected, he will meet [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=732.3199999999999s)]
*  fierce resistance from corporate Democrats in the city government, but I'd love to see what he can [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=738.8s)]
*  do if he gets in there. Yeah, so I'm really glad you said that, Jordan, because I'm against rent [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=744.4s)]
*  control, period. But Jordan's absolutely right that you have to clarify that it's a rent freeze [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=749.6s)]
*  on the apartments that already have rent control. So it's actually not like some giant bold policy [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=754.88s)]
*  either, but that almost never gets clarified in mainstream media. They just call it a rent freeze [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=760.8s)]
*  like everybody's rent is gonna freeze. And so they do that trick all the time to smear people. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=767.2s)]
*  So thank you for pointing that out and for pointing out his affordable housing policies. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=772.72s)]
*  And again, so look, I don't know if the free bus thing's gonna work, etc. But I would rather have [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=776.8s)]
*  someone trying policies that I'm not positive about, but they're actually trying to help [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=782.56s)]
*  the average person in New York. Then have a guy that we know is going to be lock, stock and barrel [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=788.2399999999999s)]
*  for all the richest, most powerful donors in the country. I've got 0% interest in that, so go Mom [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=795.04s)]
*  Donnie. And lastly, my only hesitation about Mom Donnie is he's not gonna visit Istanbul. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=800.88s)]
*  No, I don't know if I could vote for a mayor of New York that doesn't promise to go to a foreign [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=807.68s)]
*  capital of my choosing. I mean, just that question and the response from the moderators and then [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=813.04s)]
*  Cuomo jumping on him was so absurd cuz they from there, it wasn't just like, okay, that's your [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=820.32s)]
*  answer. It was you didn't give the right answer essentially, cuz then they were like, do you think [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=826.32s)]
*  Israel has a right to exist? And he laid out, yeah, sure, it does as a country that protects [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=830.88s)]
*  the rights of everybody, which it currently does not do. And Cuomo's like, that's a no, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=839.04s)]
*  that's a no. They can't fathom the idea that Israel could exist and everyone is equal. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=844.16s)]
*  Right now it's an apartheid state. He doesn't accept that and it seems like the moderators [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=852.9599999999999s)]
*  wouldn't either. But you see the bias even from the media there who are facilitating that [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=857.68s)]
*  that debate. No one else got a question. The guy who said Ukraine, he would go to Ukraine. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=863.3599999999999s)]
*  No question about the Donbass region. No question about NATO expansion, nothing like that because [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=868.64s)]
*  that fit into their prescribed worldview. But he says, I'm gonna stay in the city and that [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=876.8s)]
*  led to follow up questions, leading follow up questions. It's journalistic malpractice, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=881.8399999999999s)]
*  honestly, and you can see the bias there. Yeah, super last thing. Jordan, again, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=887.04s)]
*  100% right about that. The outrage from the moderators is hilarious and revealing. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=891.4399999999999s)]
*  God, but Israel's right to exist, huh? Wait, we're talking about the city of New York, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=897.92s)]
*  he's running for mayor. What does that have to do with any? Yeah, what do you think about the [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=902.3199999999999s)]
*  Turkish presidential elections, huh? What? Why are we having, what about Victor Orban in Hungary, huh? [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=906.3199999999999s)]
*  Why are we having this conversation? Israel is not inside New York. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=915.44s)]
*  It's demanding loyalty to a different country, even to be a mayor in this country, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=920.32s)]
*  is considered commonplace for mainstream media. They think, of course, if you wanna be a mayor [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=928.0s)]
*  of a city in America, first you have to say that you'll serve Israel. That is not normal. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=935.04s)]
*  That is very, very abnormal. And by the way, one last thing, for all the people out there going, [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=940.56s)]
*  well, you don't know, you know, New York's very Jewish. Yeah, we do know that. They're Jewish [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=947.1199999999999s)]
*  Americans. Assuming that they want the mayor of New York to serve Israel, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=952.2399999999999s)]
*  used to be an anti-Semitic position, accusing Jews in America of having dual loyalty. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=958.4s)]
*  But now the media just owns it, like, yes, of course. I mean, I guess that's their excuse. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=964.16s)]
*  For why he has to serve Israel and visit Israel and applaud Israel. And it's no excuse at all. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0TRoztJTM&t=970.56s)]
