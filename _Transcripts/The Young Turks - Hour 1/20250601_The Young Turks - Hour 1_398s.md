"The mental health of mothers in the United States declined significantly from 2016 to 2023, according to a large new study published in JAMA Internal Medicine on Tuesday.
The percentage of mothers who rated their mental health as ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù dropped sharply during the study period. At the same time, the percentage of mothers who said their mental health was poor increased ‚Äî particularly among those who were single parents, or whose children had Medicaid or were uninsured."

# STUDY: Mothers' Mental Health Took A NOSEDIVE In The Last 10 Years
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scCCQRZY6nI)
*  A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association today finds only about a [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scCCQRZY6nI&t=0.0s)]
*  quarter of mothers surveyed reported excellent mental health in 2023, a sharp drop from about [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scCCQRZY6nI&t=5.12s)]
*  38% seven years earlier. Our findings indicate that this trend, this downward decline in maternal [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scCCQRZY6nI&t=11.76s)]
*  mental health really predated the pandemic. The pandemic certainly might have given the decline [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scCCQRZY6nI&t=19.28s)]
*  a boost, but it's not the only contributing factor. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scCCQRZY6nI&t=24.4s)]
*  Yeah, raising kids in America is really hard and a lot of that pressure ends up landing on the [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scCCQRZY6nI&t=31.2s)]
*  shoulders of mothers. And there aren't really a lot of areas where you are going to get support [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scCCQRZY6nI&t=38.56s)]
*  from American society if you've chosen to be a parent. So this study, which was published on [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scCCQRZY6nI&t=46.4s)]
*  Tuesday in JAMA Internal Medicine, looked at nearly 200,000 mothers with children [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scCCQRZY6nI&t=52.4s)]
*  ages 17 and under. And the health outcomes were measured on a four-point scale, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scCCQRZY6nI&t=59.28s)]
*  including excellent, very good, good, and fair slash poor. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scCCQRZY6nI&t=65.44s)]
*  Now, the percentage of mothers who rated their own mental health as excellent declined sharply, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scCCQRZY6nI&t=69.84s)]
*  as you saw in the video we just showed you, during the study period. So let's get to some [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scCCQRZY6nI&t=75.44s)]
*  of the more granular details here. Within the timeframe studied, the percentage of [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scCCQRZY6nI&t=80.96s)]
*  excellent mental health declined from 38.4% to 25.8%. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scCCQRZY6nI&t=85.67999999999999s)]
*  Good mental health actually rose from 18.8% to 26.1%. And fair slash poor mental health [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scCCQRZY6nI&t=91.36s)]
*  also rose from 5.5% to 8.5%. So reported physical health also worsened. It wasn't just about mental [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scCCQRZY6nI&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  health, although I think the two things are connected to some extent. So the prevalence of [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scCCQRZY6nI&t=110.16s)]
*  excellent physical health declined from 28.0% to 23.9%. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scCCQRZY6nI&t=114.96s)]
*  Good physical health rose from 24.3% to 28.1%. And fair slash poor physical health didn't change [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scCCQRZY6nI&t=121.03999999999999s)]
*  significantly, okay? So while women across the socioeconomic subgroups reported mental health [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scCCQRZY6nI&t=129.6s)]
*  declines, some groups did experience more dramatic dips. Gee, I wonder who, let's take a look. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scCCQRZY6nI&t=135.2s)]
*  The clients were identified among all groups. The lowest ratings of maternal mental health [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scCCQRZY6nI&t=142.48s)]
*  were identified among mothers reporting lower levels of educational attainment, single moms, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scCCQRZY6nI&t=148.32s)]
*  and those whose children were on Medicaid or uninsured. And I really think this is concerning, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scCCQRZY6nI&t=153.83999999999997s)]
*  because our findings suggest that mothers most likely to be insured by Medicaid [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scCCQRZY6nI&t=160.0s)]
*  may have the worst maternal health. And this is important because Medicaid funds nearly half of [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scCCQRZY6nI&t=164.48s)]
*  the approximately 4 million births per year in the United States. And many moms remain on Medicaid [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scCCQRZY6nI&t=169.28s)]
*  as low income parents. Certainly, her post-cut to state Medicaid programs are concerning as they [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scCCQRZY6nI&t=175.28s)]
*  will likely impact access to mental health care for millions of American moms at a time when they [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scCCQRZY6nI&t=180.32s)]
*  may need it the most. Okay, so look, before we dive into what we just heard, I don't want to [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scCCQRZY6nI&t=185.28s)]
*  leave men out of this because men were also looked into for the study and they found declines in both [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scCCQRZY6nI&t=193.28s)]
*  excellent physical and mental health. But overall, men still had better health scores than their [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scCCQRZY6nI&t=198.16s)]
*  female counterparts because women do everything. Anyway, not everything, but let me just say, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scCCQRZY6nI&t=204.4s)]
*  with an ailing mother in the hospital, and I don't know how moms do it. I don't know how you do it. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scCCQRZY6nI&t=210.72s)]
*  If you're part of the sandwich generation and you have aging parents that you're now responsible [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scCCQRZY6nI&t=216.64s)]
*  for taking care of, on top of raising children, I only have one of those things going on and I'm [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scCCQRZY6nI&t=221.04s)]
*  gonna lose my mind. It's so difficult. I don't know how parents do it in America and I certainly [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scCCQRZY6nI&t=228.16s)]
*  don't know how parents on the lower socioeconomic end of the spectrum are able to do it. But somehow [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scCCQRZY6nI&t=234.32s)]
*  they managed to do it while essentially going through hell mentally and physically. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scCCQRZY6nI&t=240.0s)]
*  Was what do you think? Yeah, I don't like the way this lady talked about it just now because [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scCCQRZY6nI&t=244.48s)]
*  she almost made it seem like the Medicaid is what was stressing them out. Although at the end, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scCCQRZY6nI&t=252.32s)]
*  she was like, it's stressful that people that really need Medicaid are gonna have it taken away. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scCCQRZY6nI&t=257.03999999999996s)]
*  What she just didn't want to come out and say is like, yo, being broke is stressful. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scCCQRZY6nI&t=262.24s)]
*  Yes, exactly. And having financial precarity and raising kids is stressful. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scCCQRZY6nI&t=266.71999999999997s)]
*  So what I got from that, yeah. Yes, yes. And look, if you are on Medicaid, you obviously have, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scCCQRZY6nI&t=277.76s)]
*  you have an issue with resources, obviously, right? You're not making enough money to pay [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scCCQRZY6nI&t=288.08s)]
*  for your own health insurance, which is why you qualify for government aid. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scCCQRZY6nI&t=293.04s)]
*  It's about socioeconomic status. It's about your economic situation. And it's about the fact that [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scCCQRZY6nI&t=298.24s)]
*  we live in a country that doesn't really offer much support to parents. So if you're on the lower end [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scCCQRZY6nI&t=302.88s)]
*  of the socioeconomic ladder, yeah, you're going to struggle. And just think about all the random [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scCCQRZY6nI&t=307.52000000000004s)]
*  things that pop up when you're a parent, right? You gotta go to work. But if the school decides, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scCCQRZY6nI&t=311.84000000000003s)]
*  we're canceling classes today for whatever reason, you need child care. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scCCQRZY6nI&t=317.92s)]
*  And if you have money, you might be able to afford it. But those who are on the lower end [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scCCQRZY6nI&t=322.24s)]
*  of the socioeconomic ladder, they're not gonna be able to afford it. They're gonna have to call in [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scCCQRZY6nI&t=327.84000000000003s)]
*  sick. If they're working a wage job, they're not gonna get paid that day. It's just so difficult [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scCCQRZY6nI&t=332.0s)]
*  to be a parent right now. And where you are on that socioeconomic spectrum really does make a [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scCCQRZY6nI&t=337.68s)]
*  big difference. Which is why, whether you have kids or not, you should be supportive of more [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scCCQRZY6nI&t=344.4s)]
*  robust child tax credits, right? More robust programs to help parents, more emphasis on funding [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scCCQRZY6nI&t=350.32s)]
*  child care programs in this country that parents can rely on that isn't gonna break the bank. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scCCQRZY6nI&t=358.71999999999997s)]
*  But we don't prioritize those things. There's a lot of talk about our lowered birth rate. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scCCQRZY6nI&t=366.71999999999997s)]
*  But the very people who are raising alarm about that are unwilling to do what it takes [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scCCQRZY6nI&t=371.44s)]
*  to create an environment that's much friendlier to couples who want to start a family. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scCCQRZY6nI&t=376.0s)]
*  And that's really where the focus needs to be, not trashing Medicaid. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scCCQRZY6nI&t=382.56s)]
*  If anything, Medicaid should be made more robust, but that's not gonna happen anytime soon. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scCCQRZY6nI&t=386.72s)]
